                In the year 1793, the Oldenburg writer and jurist Gerhard Anton v. Halem published a now nearly
                forgotten little book titled Memorial to Oeder. The book is dedicated to his long-time friend and
                housemate Georg Christian von Oeder, a man whose figure remains vividly present in Danish historical
                research, but who has been almost forgotten by general German historiography—although he was a
                well-known figure among the more educated of his German contemporaries and maintained close relations
                with many of them. In Oldenburg, his memory has occasionally been honored—even a street has been named
                after him. Yet his significance for German history extends far beyond Oldenburg, provided one does not
                limit the concept of “history” too narrowly to political and intellectual frameworks.
                <br>
                <br>Georg Christian von Oeder died on January 28, 1791 – 175 years ago. It is time to renew his memory
                and determine his place in the history of the German and European Enlightenment. Of course, a
                comprehensive biography could only be written by someone who combines sufficiently broad knowledge in
                the natural sciences with expertise in administrative history, statistics, surveying, agrarian history,
                financial history and numismatics, as well as in personal insurance – and who is, finally, capable of
                making full use of the Danish and Norwegian archives and libraries, where rich material from and about
                him is likely still hidden.
                <br>
                <br>The goal of this essay is more modest: it aims to examine Oeder’s work and his literary activity
                during his 18 years in Oldenburg. This naturally entails a retrospective view of Oeder’s Danish and
                Norwegian fields of activity, which – at least for the German reader – serves to complement and complete
                the image of the man. For a large part of what Oeder published during his years in Oldenburg relates to
                Denmark – partly as a result of his work there, partly as an attempt to influence Danish policy. Even
                after being expelled in 1773 and gradually seeming to settle in Oldenburg, Oeder was never entirely able
                to detach himself from Denmark. The country to which he had devoted his best energies and most fruitful
                years remained, even when it cast him out, his true homeland. In this respect, the neglect that German
                historiography has shown this remarkable man is not entirely without a certain hidden inner
                justification.
                <br>
                <br>He has, however, not been completely overlooked by scholarship and regional historiography. In
                Oldenburg, Günther Jansen and Hermann Lübbing have concerned themselves with him. The Allgemeine
                Deutsche Biographie has dedicated an article to him. His native region of Middle Franconia has
                remembered him on occasion. The historiography of Schleswig-Holstein – which, like in Oldenburg, had a
                natural interest – has also taken him up. In 1940, Gottfried Ernst Hoffmann dedicated an article to him
                – from a perspective that was in keeping with the time but could not do full justice to Oeder’s
                significance – which also included a brief biographical sketch. And after the Second World War, the
                major new history of Schleswig-Holstein addressed his life. The history of savings banks could not pass
                him by either, and the history of surveying mentions his name. The latest recognition of what was likely
                his most important work – his influence on the emancipation of the peasantry in Denmark – once again
                came from a Danish hand.

                Who was Georg Christian von Oeder?Born on February 3, 1728, as the third son of theologian and vice
                principal Georg Ludwig Oeder in Ansbach, and raised in Feuchtwangen, he enrolled at the University of
                Göttingen at Easter in 1746. There he studied medicine under Richter and Prendel, but most importantly,
                botany under Albrecht von Haller; he also studied English language and literature. In the autumn of
                1749, he received his doctorate under Segner with a medical dissertation titled De derivatione et
                revulsione per venae sectionem.
                <br>
                <br>The young physician settled in Schleswig, where he met his first wife, the daughter of Councillor of
                State Ericius, whom he married in 1755. His first connection with the Danish state was established in
                Schleswig. As early as 1751, Count Johann Hartwig Bernstorff summoned him to Copenhagen on the
                recommendation of General Count Schmettau – not as a physician, but as a botanist. Oeder was appointed
                Royal Professor and entrusted with building up the capital’s botanical institute. In 1754, he was also
                made Professor of Botany at the university.
                <br>
                <br>In this capacity, he began in 1755 to travel through the Danish realm, especially Norway, in order
                to compose his survey of the plant world – Flora Danica – the first part of which appeared in 1762, and
                which Oeder evidently considered the beginning of a botanical map of all Europe. His work as a botanist
                continued until June 9, 1770, when the botanical institute was dissolved – supposedly due to the envy of
                the university.
                <br>
                <br>His many travels brought him into contact with all levels of society and all regions of the country.
                He soon began sending reports to Count Bernstorff and Count Adam Gottlob Moltke on his observations and
                encounters from all areas of life that struck him – especially in matters of state and financial
                administration, cameralistics, statistics, and economic affairs. Only a fraction of these reports has
                ever been printed; it seems that much was preserved in Oeder’s now lost papers.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder also turned to zoology during these years, though he continued to regard himself primarily as
                a botanist. In 1762, he wrote to his friend Peter Friedrich von Suhrn in Drontheim:
                <br>
                <br>“As Professor of Botany, I have in my home a Royal book collection, which indeed primarily concerns
                botany, but which has already been enriched with other valuable works that illuminate the entire field
                of natural science, especially zoology, and within that particularly ornithology. What I do not yet
                possess will later be acquired by my colleague, Professor Ascanius. Although my official duty concerns
                only botany, I also feel a strong urge to conduct research in all realms of nature and have some
                knowledge both of these and of natural philosophy in general. Moreover, as a well-traveled man, I am
                quite familiar with Norway’s geography and natural resources…”
                <br>
                <br>The breadth of his interests at that time is also evident from another letter to Suhrn from the year
                1763, in which he defends himself against being regarded as the author of an anonymous essay on customs
                farming in Drontheim. The system of customs farming was still widely practiced at the time. Oeder,
                however, clearly advocated the position “that both customs revenues and other state income are more
                advantageously collected by state officials than by being farmed out.” Alongside others, he criticized
                the fact that under the farming system, only about half of the customs revenue ultimately reached the
                state treasury. But he also pointed out “that the merchants, who were the principal stakeholders in this
                farming arrangement, were able—with the help of their customs income—to expand their existing trade and
                thereby once again increase customs revenues.”
                <br>
                <br>From his travels through Norway and Denmark also emerged, in 1769, the work that brought him both
                his greatest fame and his most bitter enemies: “Thoughts on the question: How can freedom and property
                be granted to the peasant class in those countries where they lack both?” In 1771, “Additions” to this
                work were published.
                <br>
                <br>As early as April 18, 1770, he was entrusted with a task that led him far from his previous
                scientific endeavors: he was assigned to analyze the Danish census of August 15, 1769. In 1772, he
                submitted the results to the Rentekammer (Exchequer). Only in 1789, during his time in Oldenburg, as his
                life was nearing its end, did he publish them.
                <br>
                <br>After the closure of the botanical institute, Oeder was virtually forced into the field of zoology.
                On August 1, 1770, he was sent to the island of Aunø, south of Zealand, to oversee the trial vaccination
                of cattle. The results of this work, too, were not published until his Oldenburg years, in 1776.
                <br>
                <br>When the Bernstorff ministry was overthrown in the autumn of 1770 and the Altona physician Johann
                Friedrich Struensee effectively assumed sole control of the state, Oeder too was called upon during the
                transitional phase to express his views on the organization of the state structure. On November 12,
                1770, he returned to Copenhagen from Aunø, having already briefly visited in October in a futile attempt
                to learn something about his future. He was now tasked, within the cabinet, with evaluating a number of
                memoranda that had been requested from merchants via a circular dated October 16 on the topic of trade
                and commerce. This provided the occasion to rethink the entire structure of the state administration.
                His reports were later found among Struensee’s papers. On November 19, 1770, Oeder was appointed to the
                General Commission on Land Affairs, for which he drafted the instructions and where he focused
                particularly on the issue of corvée labor. On January 5, 1771, at Struensee’s instigation, he was
                appointed Finance Councillor with a salary of 1,200 rigsdalers; from then on, state economic
                administration became his main field of activity, although he was also to continue the Flora Danica.
                <br>
                <br>In this capacity as Finance Councillor, which brought him into close association with Struensee, he
                began, on Struensee’s orders, to develop a plan for a widows’ pension fund—a subject that would occupy
                him for the rest of his life and earn him an honorary place in the history of personal insurance.
                <br>
                <br>On May 29, 1771, Oeder was appointed to the newly established Finance College, a central body above
                the three chambers, the idea for which was largely his own. He also worked in the Norwegian chamber,
                heavily burdened by the great responsibility now placed upon him.
                <br>
                <br>But soon thereafter, on January 17, 1772, it was all over. Struensee was overthrown and lost his
                life. Some of his collaborators were exiled from the capital. Oeder remained in office until July 11,
                1772. On July 13, 1772, he was appointed Governor of the Diocese of Trondheim. The salary was to be
                1,500 thalers. He was thus intended for one of the highest offices in Norway, which was divided into
                four dioceses. The title remained with him for the rest of his life, but he never assumed the position.
                While staying at Rehburg near Hanover for a spa treatment, someone else was appointed in his place. He
                learned of it through the newspaper—a not entirely unusual occurrence even today. After much back and
                forth, he was then, together with the writer Helferich Peter Sturz, sent off to Oldenburg, effectively
                removing him from the Danish state, for it was already known that Oldenburg would soon be ceded to
                Russia or become independent. He was to be rid of. Thus Denmark lost perhaps its most gifted
                administrator.
                <br>
                <br>On December 10, 1773, the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst were transferred from Denmark to
                Russia, and on December 14, 1773, to the younger line of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. Shortly before
                this, at the end of 1773, Oeder became Landvogt (chief magistrate) in Oldenburg, that is, judge of the
                Oldenburg regional court, with an annual income of about 2,000 thalers, but with a position of
                relatively little weight. Once again, he had to start from scratch, for jurisprudence was one of the few
                fields with which he had never previously engaged.

                <h3 id="kap3"></h3>
                During that transitional period following Struensee’s fall, when Oeder still did not know what his
                future held, he was met in Hanover by the famous Göttingen natural scientist and aphorist Georg
                Christoph Lichtenberg. On August 26, 1772, Lichtenberg wrote from Hanover to Kaltenhofer:
                <br>
                <br>“Imagine, this morning someone passed through here—guess who? Mr. Oeder from Copenhagen, and he
                visited Mr. Andreä. He came in the morning, and I in the afternoon—if only I had met him! He told Mr.
                Andreä that he would now have much more leisure in Trondheim to continue his Flora Danica than he had
                had in Copenhagen. He is going to Rehburg, to a spa two miles from here, and will stay there for a
                while—you could easily write to him there, if you like...”
                <br>
                <br>Although the two had missed each other then, they met just a few days later, at the beginning of
                September 1772. On September 7, Lichtenberg described from Osnabrück the first day of a five-day journey
                that had begun in Hanover, writing to Dietrich:
                <br>
                <br>“In the afternoon I traveled to Rehburg, to the famous spring, and there I met the Stiftsamtmann of
                Trondheim, Mr. Oeder, and had a long conversation with him. You will know him as the editor of the Flora
                Danica...”
                <br>
                <br>And in a letter to Kaltenhofer dated September 20, he writes:
                <br>
                <br>“From there (Hanover) I traveled to the Rehburg spring and spoke with Mr. Oeder and his pitiful
                wife...”
                <br>
                <br>And in a postscript:
                <br>
                <br>“Mr. Oeder told me that Göttingen would now be too far for him because of the Flora Danica. The rest
                of our conversation was about the widows’ pension fund, more detailed in person...”
                <br>
                <br>These excerpts show that, for educated Germans, this man from seemingly remote Copenhagen was a
                well-known figure—above all as a botanist, thanks to his Flora Danica; but the issue of widows’ funds,
                which Oeder had taken up with great energy, was not only the subject of conversation between him and
                Lichtenberg, but evidently also a topic widely discussed at the time. Not long after, in 1776, Oeder
                published his major essay “Etwas von Witwenkassen” (“Something About Widows’ Funds”) in Boie’s and
                Dohm’s Deutsches Museum, and in 1779, the widows’ fund in Oldenburg was established.
                <br>
                <br>How Lichtenberg’s remark about Oeder’s “pitiful” wife is to be understood is not entirely clear. She
                was certainly already suffering at that time from the hypochondria reported by von Halem. That Oeder’s
                wife was ill during these years is also evident from a leave request Oeder submitted to his new
                sovereign, Friedrich August, Duke of Oldenburg and Prince-Bishop of Lübeck, dated March 6, 1774. It also
                shows how hastily the transfer to Oldenburg had taken place. Oeder wrote:
                <br>
                <br>“When, toward the end of last year, His Majesty the King of Denmark appointed me to the position of
                Landvogt here, I had to hasten here to take up the post because of the then-imminent transfer of these
                counties. From Schleswig, where I had been residing, I left behind my wife—who had been ill for several
                years—at her sister’s home in Hadersleben, to which I barely had time to bring her. I also had to leave
                all my domestic affairs in disarray, just as they were.”
                <br>
                <br>He requested three months' leave to travel to Holstein to fetch his wife and make arrangements for
                setting up his household in Oldenburg. He proposed that the Obergericht Advocate Dr. jur. von Halem act
                on his behalf, writing:
                <br>
                <br>“I am already making use of him as a consultant, which Your Serene Highness will surely not
                disapprove of in my case, as someone who has not studied law, but will rather view it graciously.”
                <br>
                <br>Any other representative, he added, would demand all the official fees (Sporteln), which made up the
                largest part of his income:
                <br>
                <br>“... this absolutely necessary journey will in any case cause me considerable expense, and I must
                reestablish my household, which has been thrown into disorder by repeated transfers during my years in
                royal service, entirely from scratch and with great difficulty.”
                <br>
                <br>From a report of the Government Chancellery to Duke Friedrich August, it becomes quite clear how
                ill-suited a man like Oeder — who had not the slightest knowledge of jurisprudence and was dependent on
                outside assistance — was in the eyes of the legal profession. The report concerns v. Halem’s petition to
                be appointed as assessor at the regional court, as well as Oeder’s opinion thereon; yet it also serves,
                in part, as a response to Oeder’s request for leave. The jurists of the Government Chancellery, which
                simultaneously constituted the High Court of Appeal, write: “We regret, however, that the supplicant was
                obliged to seek the counsel of others in judicial matters; and just as we consider such conduct
                unbecoming of any judge, we find it particularly improper that he, by his own admission, chose an
                advocate who pleads frequently before the regional court.” On April 6th, 1774, the Duke granted Oeder’s
                request for leave, but not his wish to be represented by Gerhard Anton von Halem, so long as the latter
                still practiced law. Oeder was to sound out with von Halem whether he would entirely relinquish his
                practice in this regard, or else propose another substitute or request a replacement from the Government
                Chancellery. On April 13th, von Halem wrote to the Duke stating he would suspend his practice for the
                duration of the representation and was prepared to renounce it altogether if granted an assessor's post
                sufficient to support him. Oeder wrote in similar terms. Thus, on April 21st, Oeder’s representation by
                von Halem was approved by the cabinet. From 1775 onward, von Halem served six years as Oeder’s assessor.
                <br>
                <br>This exchange of letters offers not only a glimpse into the Oldenburg administrative apparatus of
                the time but also sheds some light on the biography of Gerhard Anton von Halem and his relationship to
                the housemate Oeder, who was two decades his senior.
                <br>
                <br>By the end of April 1774, Oeder was at last ready to begin his journey to Holstein. Once again, a
                correspondence ensued, this time with the Chamber — the Oldenburg authority for finance and domestic
                affairs. Oeder sought to obtain duty-free importation of his household effects into Oldenburg. On April
                20th, 1774, he wrote to the Chamber that he intended to travel to Holstein “... to fetch my wife, and
                also to arrange the transport of my household goods for the furnishing of my residence here, since, as
                is well known, I had, at the end of the past year, upon assuming my office here, been obliged to hasten
                here solely with my person and but a few garments, without any furniture. And as, to my knowledge, in
                all countries — even where the strictest customs inspections are customary — it is granted to a man
                entering a land with the intent of settling therein, to bring in his belongings and furniture intended
                for household and personal use unimpeded and duty-free, so I also hope to receive like favour from the
                Most Serene Chamber and the requisite directive to the appropriate authorities, especially the customs
                post at Elsfleth, whither I shall dispatch my goods by water.” One sees how Oeder adopts the air of a
                worldly man who can afford to lay before a government office what, in his view, it ought to do on his
                behalf. The Chamber first contacted the customs office at Elsfleth and received, on May 11th, the reply
                that used goods belonging to princely officials might be brought in duty-free, but not unused items or
                victuals. However, Oeder wished to purchase a few new pieces of furniture for his personal use; thus the
                Chamber petitioned the Duke on May 21st, and on May 30th, 1774, the latter granted permission for these
                new items to be imported free of duty as well.
                <br>
                <br>This correspondence too casts fresh light on the circumstances under which Oeder assumed his new
                position in Oldenburg. By the end of 1774, that is to say about a year after his entering service in
                Oldenburg, we already see Oeder deeply engaged in vigorous activity extending far beyond his official
                role as Landvogt. Since the Danish government had relinquished the idea of having Oeder himself continue
                his work on the proposed Danish widows’ fund and instead, though based on his earlier suggestions,
                founded a new widows’ fund in 1775 without his involvement, he now turned to preparing a similar
                institution for Oldenburg. As the establishment of this fund was not yet fully secured, he received from
                his new sovereign, on November 26th, 1774, a “certificate of assurance” – a pension promise for his
                wife, in case he should predecease her. This pension assurance (the document of which was to be returned
                and invalidated by a diagonal cut upon successful establishment of the widows’ fund) was expressly
                granted in recognition of the “much effort and care expended by Oeder in drawing up the public-spirited
                plan for a widows’ fund to be established in our lands.” It is but one of many indications that Oeder
                was a capable man of business who, despite his many schemes and aims to improve public conditions, never
                forgot his own interest.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, by the end of 1774, Oeder may be regarded as firmly established in Oldenburg. Yet there
                remained a conflict within his nature and aspirations which would run through the rest of his life and
                the entire eighteen years of his service in Oldenburg, and which can also be clearly traced in his
                numerous publications: he was willing to serve Oldenburg, but his true hopes and ambitions remained
                directed towards Denmark. Nor had Denmark forgotten him. On December 20th, 1774, Peter Friedrich von
                Suhrn wrote to him: “How do you live now, so far away from us? What do you say to our system – or more
                rightly: our non-system? What treatment of our peasants! … We are and remain, alas! a nation of slaves;
                and scarcely have we ever been worse slaves than now.”
                <br>
                <br>Four journals in particular were the outlets to which Oeder entrusted his essays during his years in
                Oldenburg. Two of these belonged to the most celebrated periodicals of their time; the third was edited
                by his friend Gerhard Anton von Halem; the fourth appeared only shortly before his death. These were:
                The German Museum by Heinrich Christian Boie and Christian Wilhelm Konrad von Dohm, whose express aim
                was “to make the Germans better acquainted with themselves”, and which enjoyed such success that it soon
                inspired many imitators; next, August Ludwig von Schlözer’s Staatsanzeigen, that critically political
                and economic journal read throughout Europe, boasting the highest circulation of its age, which no one
                in the Germany of the ancien régime could replicate, for only in Göttingen could both the requisite
                freedom from censorship and an editor of Schlözer’s stature be found; then, Leaves of Miscellaneous
                Content, published in Oldenburg by Gerhard Anton von Halem for the general enlightenment and promotion
                of education; and lastly, the Collections on History and Political Science, published by Professor
                Valentin August Heinze of Kiel, but issued in Göttingen.
                <br>
                <br>The very fact that Oeder could publish regularly in Staatsanzeigen and in The German Museum – and
                almost always under his own name in an age when many contributions appeared anonymously – already proves
                the standing that his time accorded him.

                The full rigor of Oeder’s scientific-logical thinking is revealed in the first essays he published
                during his time in Oldenburg, which were devoted to the cattle plagues he had been tasked with
                investigating on behalf of the Danish government. In 1776 appeared his works On the Inoculation of the
                Horned Cattle Plague and Reflections on the Account Contained in the Previously Printed Treatise by the
                Royal Court Physician Tode. Both are reminiscences of his Danish years, and both also contain a
                considerable effort at justification and an attempt to cast his own achievements in the proper light.
                Nevertheless, they are examples of rigorously methodical thought at a time when this was by no means a
                given — a time in which, as the Kassel years of Johann Georg Forster and Samuel Thomas Sömmering clearly
                demonstrate, the natural sciences still stood quite close to magical-mythical thought, and even to
                alchemy.
                <br>
                <br>The cattle plagues, which at irregular intervals swept through large parts of Europe and each time
                destroyed the greater part of the bovine population, were a scourge upon agriculture. Individual
                animals, however, did survive, even after infection, and experience had shown that these “plague-tested”
                animals remained alive during later outbreaks as well — they had become immune to the disease. This was
                the point of departure for the Danish government (specifically, the College of Economy and Commerce),
                when, under Oeder’s supervision between 1770 and 1772, a series of vaccination experiments were carried
                out using Camper’s method from Groningen on the small island of Aunø, located south of Zealand. The
                island was hermetically sealed off from the mainland, and only the very best, uninfected cattle were
                purchased for the trials. Detailed records were kept for every herd, and every animal that died was
                dissected. The island itself was divided into three zones: one for healthy animals, one for those
                recently inoculated or recovering, and one for those diseased. The sick animals were housed in 30 huts,
                each holding two head of cattle. Supervisors changed their clothing in a separate hut every time they
                crossed from one zone to another.
                <br>
                <br>The success of the experiment — which, according to modern veterinary medicine, may never have been
                possible in the first place and which Oeder himself still viewed with skepticism — is not the key point
                here. Rather, it is the manner of thinking to which Oeder held himself bound and which he — in this case
                not as originator, but as executor of the vaccination, as he himself emphasizes — applied throughout. He
                sought to direct the inoculation and the entire experiment objectively, “with every impartiality as to
                the outcome.” And now, five years later, in Oldenburg, he again attempts to reflect on and further
                develop his earlier results. He knows that no cure for the cattle plague has yet been found, that the
                path must lead through new experiences, disappointments, and errors, but he also makes unmistakably
                clear what that path must look like: “The way thereto, it seems to me, is that a sharp-minded man,
                endowed with the spirit of observation, carefully notes all the circumstances under which cattle
                overcome the disease and recover, in order to investigate both the nature of the disease and the paths
                by which nature seeks to overcome it.” In such observations, one must, in order to attain real results,
                forego all healing attempts on the animals. What would not be permissible with human beings is, in this
                case with animals, permissible. It is evident that from this strictly scientific posture, there is but a
                small step to the use of animal experimentation in the service of human medicine — a practice now
                common. Observation, measurement, enumeration, comparison — these foundations of all natural science
                are, in Oeder’s work — however much he may have pursued personal advantage in the application of his
                findings — present in their purest form.

                <h3 id="kap5"></h3>
                The same attitude — objective and fact-based, yet at the same time rising above the matter itself and
                unbound by taboos — is also evident in the foundational essay Something about Widows’ Funds, along with
                its numerous later additions and supplements. Now, no longer is the animal the focus — the creature with
                which man claims the right to experiment — but rather man himself: the widow, who, along with her
                children, is left helpless and destitute if the breadwinner, the working and income-earning family
                member, dies. Here begins the issue of personal insurance, which Oeder, shortly thereafter in 1778,
                solved — exemplary for his time — for Hamburg with the establishment of the General Welfare Institution.
                Welfare-state protection in the event of emergency on the one hand, and economic freedom — also
                championed by Oeder — on the other: these are the two main directions along which the previously
                relatively homogeneous structure of the birthright-defined, primarily agrarian estate-based state would
                in future unfold into its most extreme consequences. Both developments stem from the same root: the
                combination of an emerging industrial society and the emancipation of the bourgeoisie. Both developments
                already anticipate the great impulse that, shortly afterward, would appear in heightened form in the
                French Revolution, define the 19th century, and even into the 20th century still serve as the shared
                point of origin for the two opposing social systems of the Eastern and Western worlds.
                <br>
                <br>From the perspective of the 18th century, the “worker question” is merely the extreme expression of
                the future condition of the bourgeoisie: on the one hand, securing one’s livelihood; on the other,
                economic freedom (which, for the worker, takes the form of free choice of workplace and profession); and
                thirdly — as Oeder already clearly recognized in his essay on military organization, at least with
                regard to the peasantry — participation in the state. These are the problems initially facing both the
                bourgeois and the worker. In contrast, landed nobility and land-bound peasantry are tied to land and
                labor and are thus somewhat protected against poverty. For Oeder, however, it is essential that the
                peasantry be freed from serfdom. The bourgeoisie (which, in this context, must include the bureaucratic
                nobility) is comparatively rootless. It gains its possessions through economic activity and thus pushes
                for the restoration of trade and economic freedom following the era of absolutist paternalism, and in
                the context of an emerging global trade system. Yet it also offers its labor to the state in the form of
                civil service. In both cases — but especially in the latter — it has an interest in securing existence
                in cases of disability to work and in protecting the family in the event of death. Only to some extent
                is this security already provided to officials through state pensions. Thus, the essentially not-new
                idea of mutual insurance under state protection suddenly gains widespread interest and a broad
                foundation.
                <br>
                <br>The late 18th century thus develops a peculiar and previously unknown polarity between, on the one
                hand, the need for economic protection through the state or with the help of state and quasi-state
                organizations (such as patriotic societies), and on the other, the need for economic freedom. This is a
                tendency that has not left public life since.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder stands at the center of these currents and has decisively influenced them. He insists that
                widows’ funds be strictly distinguished from poor relief institutions. The latter, in his view, include
                all establishments that provide subsistence means to the needy “out of favor and grace” without prior
                personal financial contribution. In this context, Oeder strongly emphasizes the right to work, whereas
                the coercive measures of the organized poor relief system at the time understood work primarily as a
                duty, one which compelled the poor to earn their living themselves. The entire system of poor, work, and
                spinning houses was essentially based on the obligation to work of the supposedly unwilling poor, who
                therefore had to be forced into labor — starting from the assumption that the poor person was, by
                nature, an inferior being. Oeder’s approach, by contrast, sees the poor entirely in the spirit of a
                welfare state, where the needy are first and foremost viewed as human beings in distress. He writes:
                <br>
                <br>“The poor person who is willing to work has a right to demand that the opportunity for work and a
                fair wage be provided if he cannot find it himself; and the provider and benefactor of a needy person,
                whose support he is in life and for whom he would also wish to provide in the event of his early death,
                has a right — and the needy person even more so — to demand that the state not lack an institution which
                facilitates such care, or without which such care might be entirely impossible.”
                <br>
                <br>Perhaps experience in Hamburg speaks through these words. In Hamburg, for the first time perhaps, a
                structurally rooted unemployment not caused by personal fault became visible to the discerning eye of
                someone like Johann Georg Büsch. The scientific recognition of this new reality necessarily led to a
                change in attitude toward the unemployed.
                <br>
                <br>But the widows’ funds that Oeder strove for were meant to be something different. These
                institutions, which he considered “not only useful but necessary in every well-ordered state,” Oeder
                wanted to structure in such a way that “the woman, in the event of occurrence, receives her pension not
                as a favor, but as a right acquired for a fixed price, and enjoys it accordingly.” What he envisioned
                were mutual self-help institutions “according to the rules of hazard.” In this, the fundamental problem
                was posed: the relationship between contributions made and the pension or annuity to be expected — an
                issue of actuarial mathematics that would occupy Oeder throughout his life.
                <br>
                <br>He witnessed the dissolution of many older widows’ funds — such as the Widows’ Pension Fund of the
                Land Military Budget in Copenhagen, founded in 1739 — because after 30 years it became clear that their
                actuarial foundations were unsound. When he himself, on royal commission in 1771/72, was required to
                inspect the fund, he found that even the most basic prerequisite had not been met: for over three
                decades, no one had asked the applicants' age upon joining. This reveals how underdeveloped actuarial
                science still was at the time.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder himself attempted to obtain data on the age of widows and married couples at the time in order
                “to carry out individual calculations of risk” and, from the material available, to draw “a reliable
                conclusion about the whole,” that is, a representative cross-section. But his expulsion from Copenhagen
                put an end to his work, and he could only hope that someone else would continue the data collection —
                “as an experience that otherwise would not be attainable for the time being.”
                <br>
                <br>Oeder subsequently examined various widows’ funds — such as the Calenberg fund, the Bremen fund, the
                new Danish fund, and the Prussian one — and found that many of them were based on faulty calculations.
                He repeatedly attempted to improve Süßmilch’s mortality tables, which were the basis of all actuarial
                work at the time. In doing so, he arrived at fundamental insights that would become common knowledge in
                the insurance industry of the 19th century.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, he recognized, “that the crisis of a still-young widows’ fund gradually forms and stabilizes,
                and only comes to maturity after at least a generation has passed.” This is an insight that even our
                time may yet prove true again — for instance, if the major national insurance institutions and life
                insurance companies, which all had to begin anew after the currency reform of 1948, are allowed to
                operate for a full human generation.
                <br>
                <br>It is self-evident to us today that a certain minimum size is necessary for an insurance institution
                “in order to give hazard free play,” i.e., to sufficiently spread the risk. The same applies to the
                necessity — which, according to Oeder, had been neglected in Bremen — of linking the level of
                contributions to the insured’s age.
                <br>
                <br>As a proponent of free enterprise and free trade, Oeder demanded that the state guarantee the
                widows’ funds — not in terms of “the balance between means and ends, or the sufficiency of income to
                cover expenses,” but rather for “the security of the assets and the maintenance of order.” On the other
                hand, he also expected the state to truly manage the accumulated assets in trust, and not to seek profit
                from them for itself.
                <br>
                <br>To finally establish sound and lasting foundations for actuarial mathematics, Oeder made a proposal
                that seems extraordinarily modern — indeed, almost revolutionary for his time: he suggested that a
                number of children, several thousand over a few years, should be followed throughout their lives — from
                birth, through marriage and family formation, until death. “Our age,” he noted, “would certainly not yet
                enjoy the benefit of such an arrangement, but this would be a tree planted for posterity.”
                <br>
                <br>Even in these works on widows’ funds, the sober, rational, and strictly scientific character that
                runs through all of Oeder’s work is evident once again. One can understand how a man who so embodied a
                combination of level-headedness and visionary thinking — qualities so characteristic of that age of new
                beginnings — would become widely known and provoke many a debate.

                <h3 id="kap6"></h3>
                A few minor works from those years should be mentioned briefly. In 1776, Oeder published a small
                comparative study of the population of the Bishopric of Osnabrück and that of the Duchy of Oldenburg, in
                which he referred to a passage in Justus Möser’s Patriotische Phantasien, according to which the average
                population per square mile in Osnabrück had to be much greater than in Oldenburg. In 1780, he returned
                to this topic to show that the Oldenburg region had approximately the same population density as the
                Osnabrück region. He reported that “the excellent man” had “kindly accepted this correction and found it
                well-founded.” Möser had meant “Osnabrück regional square miles” by his 28 square miles for the
                Bishopric of Osnabrück, which amounted to somewhat more than 56 geographical square miles, so that at
                most 2083 people per geographical square mile were present. “A population of more than 4000 people per
                square mile is probably hardly to be found anywhere in Germany, except in the immediate surroundings of
                large cities or in marsh regions. Oldenburg too has significant linen and yarn manufacturing — e.g., in
                the village of Zetel over 300 looms; and of its area (45½ square miles), about 13 are marshland, where
                the population averages around 3300, and in some areas approaches 4000 per square mile. It is and
                remains therefore unlikely in itself that other lands in the same region should be much more densely
                populated — namely, more than twice as much — than Oldenburg.” In a small space, this passage offers a
                demographically important insight into the number of people the land could support before
                industrialization.
                <br>
                <br>Another small work, on the method of calculating the area of states, was already considered somewhat
                untenable by von Halem. Oeder’s idea was to cut the maps from uniformly thick and heavy paper and then
                weigh them, having first precisely weighed a square of the base unit. This would allow one to account
                exactly for the jagged and irregular borders of a state — which, of course, presupposes very precise
                surveying and highly accurate maps.
                <br>
                <br>At the beginning of 1776, Oeder lost his long-ill and first wife. Already at the end of 1776, now 48
                years old, he married a second time — Catherine Gerdrud Matthiessen, the daughter of a Danish judicial
                councillor. It seems that only now did a proper family life begin for him, especially since his wife
                bore him two sons and a daughter. They all outlived him.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder’s brother Johann Ludwig Oeder, who had served as court and chamber councillor in Braunschweig,
                also died during this period. This led to a correspondence between the courts in Eutin and Braunschweig,
                beginning with a letter from the Eutin cabinet on August 5, 1776: Duke Friedrich August requested the
                waiver of the inheritance tax on Oeder’s portion of the estate in order to assist the “deserving man.”
                He added that, if Braunschweig agreed, Oldenburg would henceforth act reciprocally in the same way.
                Braunschweig agreed on August 19 and proposed the general abolition of the inheritance levy between the
                two states on a reciprocal basis. Eutin responded on September 9, stating that it was only prepared to
                abolish the levy insofar as it flowed into the royal and ducal treasury, as the cities of Eutin and
                Oldenburg had old privileges entitling them to collect a portion of the levy within their jurisdiction
                for their municipal treasuries. The further course of the negotiations cannot be traced here, as it no
                longer involved Oeder. This minor incident illustrates how much the absolutism of the ancien régime
                still had to take old privileges into account — even if that limited the possibility of eliminating
                outdated measures such as the inheritance levy. In this case, the princes or their cabinets were
                progressive; the brake came from the old rights of the municipalities — a situation not uncommon at the
                end of the 18th century.
                <br>
                <br>In those years, Oeder must also have begun his preparatory work for the Hamburg General Welfare
                Institution of 1778, which will not be discussed in detail here, as it is covered elsewhere. These
                efforts led, with the creation of a “savings class,” to the founding of the world’s first savings bank —
                an institution intended as a social welfare measure for the poorer segments of the population, and meant
                to serve as “the most fitting counter-institution against the ruinous numbers lottery.” From there, the
                threads led to the establishment of a savings bank in Oldenburg in 1786.

                <h3 id="kap7"></h3>
                At that time, Oeder also began publishing individual notes he had made during his time in Danish
                service, some of which had previously been sent as reports to Bernstorff and Moltke in Copenhagen. These
                reports had been produced more or less incidentally during his work on the Flora Danica. Among these
                works is likely the study of the trade of Drontheim (Trondheim), which Oeder published in 1778. From
                autumn 1758 to January 1760, he had stayed in the town and diocese of Drontheim — the very area where,
                in 1773, he would be appointed Diocesan Governor only on paper. He reports that at that time, Roger was
                gathering material for his Lettres sur le Dannemarc, including on the economy of the diocese. Although
                Oeder provided material, it was never published. What Oeder now presents in his own right is a
                substantial piece of economic history: the diocese — which in 1769 had 164,722 inhabitants — included,
                in addition to the town of Drontheim with a for the time significant population of 7,478, also the towns
                of Christiansund and Molde. The Drontheim customs office — as was common in many places — was leased to
                Drontheim merchants. Extracts from the customs registers of 1758 show considerable trade: 17,600
                Rixdollars to Danish territory, 100,700 Rixdollars to foreign destinations, and 150,000 Rixdollars worth
                of processed copper (Garkupfer), mostly to Holland. Imports from Danish territories totaled 80,500
                Rixdollars; from outside Denmark, 193,000 Rixdollars — a large portion of which was re-exported to
                Sweden. The main imports were wool goods (47,650 Rixdollars), grain (39,250 Rixdollars), and sugar
                (26,400 Rixdollars). The dominant export by far was copper (150,000 Rixdollars), followed by fish
                (66,500 Rixdollars) and timber (26,400 Rixdollars). In that year, which is described as a poor one, 73
                ships docked and loaded in Drontheim, 26 of them originating from the town itself. The trade surplus
                amounted to 67,000 Rixdollars — enough to pay taxes and duties, to finance the children’s education
                abroad, etc. Industries included: tobacco spinning, sugar refining, and finally the copper mine at
                Røros.
                <br>
                <br>These figures, which cannot be verified here, are presented merely as an example of how meticulously
                Oeder tried to inform himself and others about a field quite distant from his usual professional
                activities. He himself notes at the end of the article “that Drontheim carries out a thoroughly solid
                and important trade — as solid as hardly any other part of the royal Danish territories, and more
                important than most of my German readers might have imagined.”
                <br>
                <br>From around the same period comes another work on a similar topic: the establishment of a new
                commercial town in Norway. This was submitted to the Danish government in 1763 but "was only made known
                to the public in 1786," during Oeder’s time in Oldenburg — the same year the Oldenburg savings bank was
                founded. This small work, which today appears to survive only in a collected volume from 1792, published
                posthumously, encapsulates much of Oeder’s thinking on economic policy. He proposed founding a town
                north of Drontheim, convinced that “this northern town would be the best base for our Icelandic,
                Faroese, and Finnmark-specific trade and could become a center for entrepôt trade with Archangel.” The
                presence of a bourgeoisie, commerce, and crafts would also invigorate the peasantry: “wherever a
                substantial branch of urban enterprise takes root, wastelands become fertile.” Exchange, and fast
                exchange in particular, was important — as it saved time, “this unrecognized and so little-valued good.”
                Above all, however, peasants lacked freedom, property, and time — here, the ideas of an early advocate
                for the emancipation of the peasantry are visible. Time was also lost in long transport routes for goods
                — for instance, fish would often spoil. Copenhagen itself had already grown too large for the body of
                the state and only disrupted “the even spread of trade throughout the realm.” Oeder believed that a
                newly founded town north of Drontheim would attract enough merchants. “The Finnmark trade should
                immediately be moved there entirely, the Icelandic and Faroese trade in part; and finally, if one wanted
                to develop entrepôt trade with Russian goods, then this new town should be made a free port — which
                would undoubtedly attract factors from the Hanseatic cities, as well as from the Dutch and English.”
                Free trade, free ports, exchange between peoples and states — and through this, also influence on the
                situation of the peasantry — that is the network Oeder believed must be supported from all sides.

                While Oeder was involved in the preparations for the Hamburg General Welfare Institution of 1778 and
                published numerous essays on the issue of personal insurance, life insurance, especially widows’ funds,
                he simultaneously set about establishing such a widows’ fund in Oldenburg itself. It was founded on
                November 1, 1779, and Oeder himself became one of its three directors. Two years later, on September 14,
                1781, the Duke granted approval for an expansion, and on March 11, 1782, the fund was extended and
                transformed into a widows’, orphans’, and life annuity fund.
                <br>
                <br>Although this development cannot be separated from that in Hamburg, there were nevertheless some
                differences — not least because Oldenburg lacked a “Patriotic Society” such as the one in Hamburg that
                acted as a sponsoring institution. Based on announcements in the Oldenburg Weekly Advertisements, Oeder
                published the main provisions of the Oldenburg Widows’ Fund in Schlözer’s Correspondence in 1781. He
                referred to his essay in the Deutsches Museum of August 1779, where he had set out the calculation of
                the tables according to Süßmilch’s mortality tables, and continued:
                <br>
                <br>“The institution is for all subjects, but only for subjects and not for foreigners. However,
                servants of the court are obligated to join according to the income of their office; with the option to
                exceed the prescribed pension amount; however, this amount may not exceed the sum of 500 Reichsthalers
                in annual pension. No widow’s pension is henceforth to be expected from the sovereign. Nevertheless, he
                shall initially contribute 500 Reichsthalers annually to the institution, from which administrative
                costs are covered and which benefits the servants as a relief of their burden regarding the mandatory
                contribution, currently set at the eighteenth part. Only the two accountants in Oldenburg and Eutin
                receive salaries… The age of majority in the orphans’ fund is the end of the 25th year. The fund of the
                institution is invested in secure landed property of local inhabitants. The sovereign is the guarantor
                of the institution and of the claims of every interested party. All and any secondary financial
                intentions — which we, under proper restrictions, do not wholly consider impermissible — are absent from
                this institution.”
                <br>
                <br>Shorter and more concise the fundamental principles and peculiarities of the Oldenburg Widows’ and
                Orphans’ Fund can hardly be described. Above all, crucial is the guarantee of the sovereign, combined
                with a renunciation of any right to exploit the contributions paid in for state purposes. Here, the
                patriarchal character of the Oldenburg government, directed toward the welfare of its subjects, becomes
                quite evident. The regulation by which the fund was extended to a life annuity institution was also
                published by Oeder in Schlözer’s new State Announcements.
                <br>
                <br>How closely Oeder followed the development of similar funds in other territories is shown at the
                beginning of this publication, where he writes:
                <br>
                <br>“At a time when the wavering and collapse-threatening Bremen and Calenberg widows’ funds cause so
                much talk and concern, the few thoroughly established institutions of this kind — the new Danish widows’
                fund, the Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the Oldenburg widows’ funds, as well as the Hamburg General Welfare
                Institution — deserve to become better known; especially the latter, the Hamburg G.W. Institution, due
                to its wide scope and because it is open to everyone outside Hamburg, whereas the others mentioned are
                restricted to the residents of their respective countries.”
                <br>
                <br>A note by Schlözer highlights as a special advantage of the Oldenburg life annuity institution that
                the board alone may decide whether to admit someone. This prevents individuals from frivolously
                withdrawing their assets from the family and transferring them to the life annuity fund.

                <h3 id="kap9"></h3>
                While Oeder increasingly occupied himself with Oldenburg affairs, placing his vast experience and
                imaginative mind at the service of Oldenburg’s reforms, his interest in Danish conditions, even after
                nearly a decade of distance, had by no means faded. He himself had not been forgotten in Denmark either,
                but remained caught in the crossfire of controversies—controversies which especially revolved around a
                problem that had shaken the German-Danish composite state, not least since the Struensee era: the
                problem of language and nationality.
                <br>
                <br>As early as in his essay on the inoculation of cattle plague from 1776, Oeder had felt compelled to
                emphasize that he had written his reports to the Danish government in the Danish language. In a pamphlet
                dated July 1781, he now found himself forced to defend against the attacks of his former friend
                Christian Fabricius, professor of economics at the University of Kiel. Fabricius positioned himself as
                an advocate of the “indigenat” (native-born) principle, the privilege of those born in the country, and
                accused Oeder of having displaced another botanist named Holm through his appearance as a botanist in
                Norway—specifically through his work on the Flora Danica—forcing Holm to “exchange his beloved science,
                to which he had devoted his whole life, for another which he did not understand and had to learn from
                scratch.” Fabricius went so far as to write that Holm “died a martyr of the nation for the sake of
                foreigners, in the prime of his life.”
                <br>
                <br>Oeder responded that surely Denmark had room for more than one botanist. Moreover, it was by no
                means certain that Holm would have received the position, since they had never been in competition.
                Rather, Oeder had only been commissioned by the King to “establish a botanical institution from the
                resources of his private chamber” and then to “produce a work on the native plants of his European
                countries” after he had already entered Danish service. Fabricius knew full well, wrote Oeder, “that
                just as I was reluctant to be drawn away from botany, I was equally reluctant to leave Denmark
                entirely—that I considered it my second homeland, in whose service I spent over twenty years, the better
                half of my life up to that point.” He also pointed to his “now reissued” work on the emancipation of the
                peasantry and emphasized that he had “also in other matters written eagerly in favor of proper freedom
                in trade and commerce,” and had expressed views “on Denmark’s and its associated states’ population,
                prompted by the census carried out in 1769.”
                <br>
                <br>In this spirit, he called for fairness towards foreigners, whose admission as competitors to the
                native-born was, after all, a matter for the government to decide. “Loyalty, integrity, and a sense of
                duty on the part of these foreigners toward their second homeland must not be doubted—that would not be
                patriotism, but… envy and a spirit of persecution.” Finally, Oeder felt compelled to add: “Mr. Fabricius
                knows that I spoke and wrote the language of the country.”
                <br>
                <br>The Danish xenophobia that reveals itself here—and against which Oeder had to defend himself—was
                triggered not least by Struensee’s attempts to replace the Danish language entirely with German. In a
                “composite state” such as Denmark, which encompassed elements of three peoples—German, Danish, and
                Norwegian—this issue, as the 19th century would show, could become a force of disintegration. Yet it
                appears that, in Oeder’s time and at least in Fabricius’ attacks, it had not yet assumed a fixed
                direction. The questions of nationality, language, and the right of indigenacy still seemed to
                intermingle. Had Oeder been a German-speaking Schleswig-Holsteiner, such a sharp attack may perhaps not
                have occurred. The question arises whether, to Danes of that era, a Schleswig-Holsteiner was still
                considered a native-born citizen or already a “German.” Oeder, for his part, believed he could answer
                the attack by pointing to his knowledge of Danish and above all his service to the Danish state. In
                effect, he championed a theory of earning indigenacy through merit.
                <br>
                <br>It is striking that he still felt the need to justify himself and to emphasize his Danish loyalties,
                even though a return to Denmark seemed hardly likely. Apparently, he still believed that Denmark would
                need him and would call him back. If that was still the case after so many years, it is not far-fetched
                to suppose that he had never fully settled in Oldenburg. One might say that he was too great, his
                thoughts too wide-ranging, his creative imagination too expansive for effective work in this small
                state, which could offer him, as a basis for life, only the office of a provincial governor—while all
                the higher offices that might have given him broader scope for action were firmly in other hands. His
                appointment to specific tasks such as the founding of the widows’ fund, later the land survey, etc.,
                could not substitute for the broad, independent field of activity that a man like him must have desired.
                <br>
                <br>However, when, around 1786–1788, Denmark turned again to the task of peasant emancipation and drew
                upon Oeder’s ideas, and when he actually received a call to return to Denmark, he apparently already
                felt too old; he did not respond to the summons but contented himself with a new and expanded edition of
                his Considerations and Additions.
                <br>
                <br>Given this deep attachment to Denmark, it is not surprising that, five years later—around 1786/87—he
                once again did not meet a renewed and considerably harsher attack on his person with silence, but
                responded vigorously. This time the attack came in a Danish-language polemic by Conference Councillor
                Fleischer against Chamber Councillor Baden, from the year 1786, in which Oeder’s writings on peasant
                emancipation were also addressed. It stated: “What were sensible people to make of such a project-maker?
                Everyone knew the German from whom all these contortions had originated.” It was said that he had “been
                offered a considerable estate freely and without cost, on the sole condition that he carry out his plan
                there at his own expense,” but that he had not dared accept it. “The wretched coward…” and so on.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder denied this claim and again took up the nationality issue and the matter of German-hatred,
                remarking: “But of course, such things are to be expected from a writer who addresses his public with
                the most peculiar expression ‘a Danish-minded public’—no doubt believing this to be an honor.” He
                sharply opposed this narrow-minded nationalistic thinking and declared his allegiance to reason, which
                knows no borders: “The way of thinking among every reasonable public throughout the world is one and the
                same and allows no local variations. Thus, my appeal is directed to the reasonable public in Denmark,
                whose approval, as a former resident of Denmark who long regarded it as his second homeland, I
                seek—believing with good reason that my removal was due above all to my ardent defense of the truths
                which are now the subject of such solemn debate.”
                <br>
                <br>Thus, according to Oeder’s own view, his commitment to the emancipation of the peasantry had brought
                about his downfall in 1773. He opposed any effort “to make the name of the respectable German nation—or
                any nation—a term of abuse.” Enlightened, rational thought, which viewed national borders and ethnic
                origins as secondary, stands here in stark opposition to sentimental nationalism—paired with
                German-hatred and drawing its force from it.

                If we pick up the chronological thread again, we find Oeder's next publication in 1782: an excerpt from
                the ordinance of the Hamburg General Welfare Institution, this time from the second edition, in which
                the tables had been improved.
                <br>
                <br>From 1785, we finally possess an unpublished manuscript concerning the issue of canal construction
                through Schleswig-Holstein, which had stirred emotions since the early 1770s. The “Patriotic Society” in
                Hamburg, to which Oeder—as we have seen—was closely connected, was also engaged with the question of an
                Alster-Trave Canal, i.e., a shipping connection between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Oeder’s paper
                corresponds in content with a report he had already presented to the Governor, Prince Charles of
                Holstein, in the summer of 1776—before any canal construction had begun. Again, we see that the same
                ideas occupied Oeder for many years.
                <br>
                <br>Fundamentally, Oeder takes a negative stance toward the idea of a canal connection between the North
                Sea and the Baltic. Technical, political, and trade policy concerns reinforce each other. Behind these
                concerns lies, once again, the fear that his still-beloved Denmark might be economically harmed by such
                a project. His principal objections include the high construction costs, maintenance expenses—especially
                shoreline upkeep in winter—the question of tolls, which could discourage transit trade. He is also
                troubled by potential losses in Øresund customs revenue: “If many of the goods that previously passed
                through the Sound were now to go via the canal, would not the Øresund toll revenues be significantly
                diminished, and could one really count the gains of expanded trade as sufficient compensation?”
                <br>
                <br>Here we see the old financial practitioner, weighing the gain of stimulated trade against the loss
                of income to the state treasury. The canal would not serve trade in the regions it traverses but only
                the larger export from the Baltic: “But to attract such trade in amounts significantly exceeding current
                levels—what immense resources would be needed to compete with those nations who still take the Sound
                route for exporting their products and importing their goods, and who will deliberately obstruct
                Denmark’s efforts to capture a greater share of the Baltic trade?”
                <br>
                <br>He even raises the specter of a separation of Holstein from the Danish realm: “Has one adequately
                planned for the case in which the Duchy of Holstein might be alienated from the Crown of Denmark and
                from the Duchy of Schleswig or South Jutland under its authority, so that the canal, running along the
                border, might not in time turn into a disadvantage for the Crown?”
                <br>
                <br>Oeder then points to the issue of water supply. Special ship types, adapted to the canal bed and
                locks, would be needed—around 70 tons. “But are such vessels even suitable for crossing the ocean
                between far-flung places, like St. Petersburg and Bordeaux or Lisbon?” Baltic trade mainly involves bulk
                goods, and the Dutch and Swedes typically used very large vessels. Ships of the size that could use the
                canal would not be profitable over long distances. Moreover, cargo transfer at the canal entrance and
                exit would significantly raise costs. Under such conditions, a simple barge canal, with lower water
                requirements, would suffice.
                <br>
                <br>His own proposal was precisely such a barge canal, and instead, the elevation of Copenhagen to the
                status of a free port: “And upon full reflection—would it not have been better to make Copenhagen a free
                port, and thus the entrepôt and staple market of Baltic trade? It could not be more conveniently
                located, and if the government granted permission, all trading nations would use it—for it is immensely
                convenient to have such a midpoint from which goods can be shipped year-round, even when the inner
                Baltic harbors are still frozen or about to freeze.”
                <br>
                <br>“It’s true that most of the goods stored in depot would be owned by foreign nations; but Danes must
                not be offended by that—let alone, like children with small arms, try to grasp more than they can carry,
                dreaming that they might monopolize the vital Baltic trade. Rather, they must content themselves with
                the great benefits that warehousing, handling, transshipment, overwintering of foreign ships and crews,
                increased freight opportunities for Danish ships, and provisioning of all vessels would surely bring.
                With the prospect that more and more forwarding and commission trade might come into Danish hands—or
                that foreign factors would naturalize—and that, as in Bergen, the originally German trading offices
                would eventually become Norwegian.”
                <br>
                <br>“Even politically, it would matter: all nations would protect and support a state hosting such a
                vital depot, so long as it refrained from interference.”
                <br>
                <br>Thus, Oeder envisioned for Copenhagen a role similar to that of Lübeck in the golden age of the
                Hanseatic League: the hub of Baltic trade. Ultimately, his vision implies not only the establishment of
                a free port in Copenhagen but a kind of neutralization of Denmark as a whole. That his opposition to the
                canal was wrong would later be proven: no canal in Europe saw as much ship traffic in the 19th century.
                <br>
                <br>Yet in another respect, Oeder was right: none of the canals between the North and Baltic Seas lie on
                Danish soil today. Since Denmark had invested considerable funds into the project and could not prevent
                the political developments in Schleswig-Holstein during the 19th century, it ultimately harmed only
                itself—at its own expense.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, let it be briefly noted that Oeder had an indirect share in the reform of Oldenburg’s poor
                relief system and in the founding of the Oldenburg savings bank in 1786.

                <h3 id="kap11"></h3>
                Throughout the entire 1780s ran another initiative—a project driven mostly by Oeder’s initiative, which
                he did not live to see completed, and whose scope was significantly curtailed after his death: the
                Oldenburg state surveying ordered on July 9, 1781, and the creation of the Oldenburg district (Vogtei)
                map.
                <br>
                <br>By 1787, his friend Gerhard Anton von Halem began publishing a periodical, likely modeled on
                Deutsches Museum, titled Blätter vermischten Inhalts, promising “true and useful” content. Oeder
                contributed several articles explaining the purpose and methodology of the land survey—information
                otherwise laborious to extract from archival records. The volume included correspondence between Oeder
                and Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig, shedding light on the project’s motivations.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder employed the 1779 Thomas Bugge method—combining triangulation and astronomical observations.
                He enlisted Danish surveyor Caspar Wessel, who worked in Oldenburg from 1782–85. An observatory was
                built atop the Oldenburg ramparts. Triangulation extended, with Stade’s permission, across the Weser
                River into Land Wursten, then from Ritzebüttel to Glückstadt. With an error under one-thousandth, it
                aligned with the network from Copenhagen via Husum. The triangulation thus stretched from Copenhagen to
                Wildeshausen and the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. Known coordinates in Copenhagen allowed precise
                geolocation of other towns—marking Germany’s first triangulated survey. Oeder proposed expanding the
                network across Germany. He saw precise mapping as vital for maritime navigation near the Elbe and Weser
                estuaries.
                <br>
                <br>The previous duke, Friedrich August, had insisted on including the Weser; his successor, Peter
                Friedrich Ludwig, demanded maps of the Jade Bay and Wangerooge. Thus, geodesist Behrens extended the
                triangulation to Wangerooge, and Reinke of Hamburg surveyed the Elbe.
                <br>
                <br>Planned outputs included: a copper-engraved map of the entire duchy; district maps at 1″:2000′, in
                three copies (for the ducal cabinet, chamber, and district offices); and specialized charts at 1″:400′
                in two copies (for chamber and districts). The ducal chamber would hold spare “working copies” for
                parcel area calculation—showing owners, plot names, parcel numbers, land use, etc. This would enable
                fair land taxation based on acreage and quality. Oeder also intended comprehensive statistical analysis.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder argued that mapping allowed the duke to survey his realm. “There is no need to worry as if
                this enterprise harbored harmful intentions”—this reassurance featured prominently in his
                correspondence, as inhabitants were suspicious of the survey.
                <br>
                <br>He also outlined his views on internal colonization: mapping could distinguish arable from
                non-arable lands. He acknowledged the difficulty of draining and cultivating bogs: “We have no
                significantly fertile uncultivated land... no room for colonists solely on farming income... future
                cultivation must come from those with alternate income sources—likely locals, not outsiders—gradually.”
                He urged dissolution of communal land tenures—pasture, grazing, common fields—to enable agricultural
                improvement. He saw this as essential to modernization—but potentially disruptive to rural society. Yet
                he emphasized that official surveying was crucial to protecting property rights.
                <br>
                <br>He also initiated reforestation of the Osen Hills (report, January 7, 1786).
                <br>
                <br>Annual surveying costs were about 2,500 Reichsthalers: Oeder received ~300; lieutenant/conducteur
                Lindeloff received 250; plus clerks, equipment, materials, etc. Debates arose over expenses, e.g.,
                whether Conducteur Hüner needed a horse year-round. Minister Count Holmer argued for expense
                reimbursement by Oeder only when necessary.
                <br>
                <br>Overall, Oeder’s Oldenburg surveying was extremely valuable. The district map held in the state
                archive—now reprinted at 1:25,000—stands as a highlight of late-18th-century Oldenburg cartography,
                hardly achievable before the French revolutionary era, and unlikely without Oeder’s leadership.

                <h3 id="kap12"></h3>
                The records clearly show: Oeder did not like working without pay and always sought to improve his own
                income when taking on such assignments. In 1789, two years before his death, he once again entered into
                a debate with his sovereign about his salary and its increase. On January 9, 1789, he submitted a
                seven-page petition to Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig, in which he laid out his views on his salary, fees
                (Sporteln), and related matters. Once again, he invoked his glorious Danish past: “If my post as
                Landvogt may seem somewhat lucrative ... one must remember that this office was assigned to me by my
                previous sovereign—whose service I was transferred from to this one—as compensation for a provostship
                (indeed taken from me nolens volens) which was certainly a distinguished position.”
                <br>
                <br>The acting minister, Count Holmer, also highlighted this aspect of Oeder’s character quite clearly
                in a Pro Memoria to the Duke dated February 7, 1789: “The striking one-sidedness of the principles
                underlying this petition surely calls for His Highness’s humane and discerning indulgence; but with
                such, Your Highness will also judge the exaggerated, anxious concern of the petitioner that something
                might be taken from the income which he receives loco salarii, and which also serves as compensation for
                his previous post.” Count Holmer then proposed a way to transition Oeder’s Oldenburg regional court—the
                only one still supported by fee-based income—to a fixed salary like the others, without disadvantaging
                the current officeholders. The loss would be borne by the state treasury. Oeder was to receive a salary
                of 2,000 Reichsthalers and two assessors, whereas his successor would receive only 1,500 Rth. and one
                assessor. This shows that both Count Holmer and the Duke respected Oeder’s past Danish career as well as
                his contributions to Oldenburg, being willing to grant him a special salary arrangement at the state’s
                expense. In addition to the 2,000 Rth. salary, Oeder received further compensation as director of the
                widow’s fund and the land survey, as well as a firewood allowance. However, he was still required, as
                before, to provide courtrooms within his own residence. Once more, on March 15, 1789, he protested an
                alleged disadvantage. In another seven-page letter, he complained that the pension of 100 Rth. paid to
                the widow of his predecessor Günther should, upon her death, revert to him. The resolution he received
                on March 27 was very brief, stating only that “in view of the already substantial standing salary
                assigned to him,” the matter was considered settled.
                <br>
                <br>In the same year, 1789, Oeder also applied for a patent of nobility. On August 31, 1789, he wrote to
                Vienna requesting ennoblement. He enclosed a draft coat of arms. His elevation to the knightly nobility
                (Ritterstand) was dated November 2, 1789. From that point, he was entitled to call himself Edler von
                Oeder. However, his friend Gerhard Anton von Halem could not fully comprehend this step. In his view,
                Oeder had yielded to a prejudice. He believed that love for his children had motivated a decision that
                was, in light of Oeder’s merits, unnecessary for himself.

                <h3 id="kap13"></h3>
                But let us return to Oeder’s work. In 1769, a major census was conducted in Denmark, the evaluation of
                which was entrusted to Oeder. At the time, he produced a number of essays on the results, but they were
                not published. Twenty years later, in 1789, Oeder had them printed, not forgetting—during the year of
                the outbreak of the French Revolution—to remark that he was “generally only a friend of publicity that
                remains within proper bounds,” meaning he supported limited freedom of the press, and that he had
                received permission to publish the essays the year before—a permission he felt obliged to seek, since he
                “did not view such a fruit of a commission entirely as literary property.”
                <br>
                <br>Oeder’s remarks go far beyond purely statistical content, venturing instead into interpretation of
                the census results and their practical applications. Denmark’s population is stated to be 2,100,000.
                Without the land connection to Germany between Travemünde and Hamburg, Denmark would be a purely
                maritime power. He explains the lower population in the northern countries by the greater need for fuel
                there—thus, population as an exponent of available heating resources! That is a perspective which, in a
                time of still relatively limited bulk goods exchange, cannot be completely dismissed.
                <br>
                <br>For domestic policy, Oeder recommends that the Danes take Great Britain and Holland as models. As
                the chief means of promoting industry, he considers: little government, but much freedom. This is
                especially true for Norway: “If one wants to help Norway, the effort must not begin with agriculture but
                with urban trades,” a thought Oeder had already expressed in his 1763 essay on founding a town in the
                northern lands. “But how can urban trades be expanded? Only through more freedom, this better mother
                than mere necessity ever was—of diligence, inventiveness, the arts, taste, competition, frugality,
                affordability, general and particular prosperity.” This essay contains something like Oeder’s
                economic-political testament, which is summed up in several sentences that are printed in bold and even
                capitalized at the end:
                <br>
                <br>“I challenge the busybody statecraft, which so readily entangles the government in the trades of its
                subjects and everywhere places obstacles in the way of voluntary human enterprise with commands and
                prohibitions—I challenge it to show whether its anxious artifices have anywhere achieved what almighty
                freedom has everywhere from Altona to Canton freely and rightly brought about; and I adhere to my
                principle: Little interference by the government in the trades of the subjects, external protection and
                justice, and all the more freedom.”
                <br>
                <br>In short: full freedom in trade and industry, limited freedom in the press. One would very much like
                to know whether these sentences were already present in the 1769 manuscripts or were only added during
                revision for publication.
                <br>
                <br>However, this greater economic freedom is, in Oeder’s view, quite compatible with the expansion of
                certain types of planning in other areas of state life, as has already been shown elsewhere. Thus, Oeder
                developed a “plan for the enumeration of the people in the state,” which appears remarkably modern.
                Censuses were to be repeated regularly every 5 or 10 years. Forms were to be distributed to householders
                and individuals; Oeder created templates for these. Likewise, the “collectors” were to receive special
                forms for compiling the results from their area. All this was to be gathered in a permanent
                office—essentially a kind of statistical bureau. Oeder explicitly emphasizes that the interviewers were
                to bring “nothing but plain reports and data from individuals,” no “classifications.” That is, they were
                not to interpret or analyze but to collect uniform, statistically usable facts according to prescribed
                patterns. The danger inherent in any survey—that the form of the question might suggest the answer to
                the respondent—was evidently already recognized here.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder took the publication of this essay collection as an opportunity to send a copy to Duke Peter
                Friedrich Ludwig of Oldenburg and to recommend a repeat of the 1769 census for the Oldenburg state
                (which at that time still belonged to Denmark), noting that peasant resentment toward the census could
                now no longer be expected. The letter shows—just like the earlier material on land surveying—that the
                rural population still resisted innovations quite stubbornly, fearing they might lead to changes in
                property ownership or increases in taxation.
                <br>
                <br>In this context, Oeder published the section of his large essay collection on the Danish 1769 census
                that concerned Oldenburg again separately in von Halem’s journal. The population of the County of
                Oldenburg was given as 62,854, and that of the County of Delmenhorst as 16,217. This resulted in a total
                population of the two counties of 79,071 souls. Of these, 3,167 were in the town of Oldenburg, and 1,526
                in the town of Delmenhorst. The ratio of male to female inhabitants was 1000:1053; since the census took
                place in the summer, many men were in Holland or at sea, which explains the slight surplus of women. On
                average, Oldenburg at the time was more densely populated than Denmark, Norway, or the duchies of
                Schleswig and Holstein. Oeder commented: “In the Oldenburg marshlands, more land is under the plow than
                in Holstein, where more land is left for grazing, and this probably gives the Oldenburg marshes the
                advantage of greater population density.”
                <br>
                <br>The age structure reveals the early mortality of the time:
                <br> Out of every 1000 inhabitants, according to Oeder’s data:
                <br> 226 were aged 1–8 years
                <br> 155 aged 9–16
                <br> 145 aged 16–20
                <br> 123 aged 25–32
                <br> 109 aged 33–40
                <br> 70 aged 40–48
                <br> 171 aged 49 and older

                The essay on the military system in Denmark, which appeared in 1790 but was written as early as 1767 and
                only now published, also dealt with fundamental issues—this time not of economic life, but of foreign
                and domestic policy. And once again, it is striking how modern this man thought. Even his definition of
                the purpose of the state is formulated in a way that remained valid at least up to the eve of the First
                World War:
                <br>
                <br>“The first concern of a state and a king must be to make its independent existence, in view of world
                affairs and neighboring states, secure and based on the state's own internal strengths.”
                <br>
                <br>It is these internal strengths that are now in focus. Oeder rejects a professional standing army.
                The security of the state's existence cannot be ensured with recruited forces alone.
                <br>
                <br>“Therefore, we must seek the necessary strength within the nation itself. The national troops must
                be the main force, the recruited ones a secondary matter.”
                <br>
                <br>He points to the example of Norway, where this still existed. But an army made up of conscripted
                subjects can only be relied upon if they also feel connected to their state:
                <br>
                <br>“The army must consist of citizens who are capable of loving the state they are to defend.”
                <br>
                <br>Here, the transition from subject to citizen is already taking place in thought—if the text from
                1767 is accurately reproduced, then more than two decades before the events in France.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder also expresses himself very clearly on the question of the relationship between military and
                civil power: the military power is subordinate to the civil.
                <br>
                <br>“A king, no matter how he rules—whether he consults a council or follows his own path—must, even the
                King of Prussia, who is both king and general, nevertheless in the order of his thoughts subordinate his
                military system to the state as a whole. He must first consider the state of his country and the global
                situation, the needs of the state and its resources; he must first determine the goal and objective,
                know how strong his military should be, and know where and how to obtain money and men. Only then does
                the organization of military power come into play.”
                <br>
                <br>He viewed with great concern the attempt by the Ministry of War in Denmark in 1763 to detach itself
                from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and he also pointed out some traits that seemed to him typical of
                military thinking:
                <br>
                <br>“In all the deliberations in the military establishment, there has been a great deal of animosity;
                the violently inclined way of thinking so common in the military class has been all too evident—a way of
                thinking that can be useful when facing the enemy, but that ruins everything in peaceful deliberations
                with fellow citizens. It is not acceptable to insist, where the question is whether a given measure
                suits the nature and conditions of the country, always to say: it must work.”
                <br>
                <br>These are sentences still worth considering today. The emerging national feeling of the time, which
                would dominate the following century, is ultimately encapsulated in the sentence:
                <br>
                <br>“No, for the defense of the fatherland, no citizen is too precious.”

                <h3 id="kap15"></h3>
                After the economic policy expert and the military policy thinker, the administrator Oeder also speaks
                out once again. The essay written in 1772 on the organizational changes of the Copenhagen colleges that
                had taken place since October 1770 is, much more than all of Oeder’s previous writings, also a piece of
                self-defense regarding his position in the Struensee affair. But even here, a number of fundamental
                ideas are expressed, whose relevance, however, proved to be much more short-lived, since the French
                Revolution marked a deep and fundamental turning point in almost all European states, particularly with
                regard to internal political and administrative structures. Oeder dated the preface to the essay 13 June
                1790.
                <br>
                <br>In the essay, Oeder affirms that the idea of establishing a financial college, to which the three
                chambers (financial authorities) of the three constituent states of the Danish composite monarchy
                (Denmark, Norway, Schleswig-Holstein) would be subordinated, originated from him. He had been enabled to
                express his “thoughts on various parts of state administration” through a cabinet order dated 4 January
                1771.
                <br>
                <br>“I supported the man to whom the king, as he had done with so many others, had referred me and
                placed above me, with my advice—according to the best of my knowledge and conscience.”
                <br>
                <br>This is Oeder’s statement regarding his relationship to Minister Struensee: a justification that is
                no justification at all, considering—as was of course known to everyone—that King Christian VII was
                merely a puppet in Struensee’s hands. Yet it still carries a certain validity if one considers the
                position in which a civil servant, trained and accustomed to loyalty toward the head of state, finds
                himself when this leadership suddenly changes its governing principles entirely. The role of the civil
                servant during a regime change—this was a problem Oeder, too, had to confront. By loyally serving the
                new leadership, he failed and was forced to leave—whereby, as was evident elsewhere, his reform ideas on
                the peasant question likely also contributed to his downfall.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder considered it correct that
                <br>
                <br>“the administration of customs should indeed be united with the management of the other royal
                revenues; but that, on the other hand, a separate department should exist for commerce and manufacturing
                matters, or more precisely, for political economy in general, and for overseeing the means of
                subsistence of the subjects, which is the government’s responsibility.”
                <br>
                <br>He thus advocated the separation of "oeconomica publica" and "police" from the actual fiscal
                administration—an evolution that, through the establishment of commercial colleges, was being initiated
                in many places during this period. Oeder also wanted to separate financial business from chamber
                business, and he defined this distinction very precisely:
                <br>
                <br>“Financial business consists of: the application of the state's revenues; the general oversight of
                the sources of revenue; the modification of existing rules and regulations, and the introduction of new
                ones.Chamber business consists of: the collection of the revenues; the particular management of each and
                every source of revenue; the application of existing rules and regulations to all specific individual
                cases.”
                <br>
                <br>He concluded, with regard to his proposal for three chambers and one financial college:
                <br>
                <br>“By placing a deputy over each chamber and composing the financial college from these deputies, one
                achieves both the necessary separation and the required coherence.”
                <br>
                <br>For economic matters, he recommended the establishment of a general economic college in Copenhagen,
                with a special college for Norway in Christiania and four economic deputations in the four Norwegian
                diocesan districts, each composed
                <br>
                <br>“of a few of the most prominent royal officials, and of some of the wealthiest and most respected
                private individuals, merchants, manufacturers, mine owners, landowners, and the like”
                <br>
                <br>—thus, offices that were effectively mixed bodies of state administration and economic
                self-governance. Just as he had already elevated the subject to a citizen in his essay on the military
                system, he emphasized here as well that
                <br>
                <br>“the interests of the government and the interests of the subjects are inseparable.”
                <br>
                <br>It is for this reason that he recommended the mixed economic deputations, for:
                <br>
                <br>“It is never advisable that the servants of the state, who are appointed to supervise the revenues
                of the state, should also have, solely and one-sidedly, the direction of the commerce and livelihood of
                the subjects.”

                If all of Oeder’s most recently mentioned works are essentially prints of studies he had conducted
                during his time in Denmark but had not yet published — now merely sent to print and, at most, revised
                beforehand — then, in the final years of his life, a new issue also occupied him, once again prompted by
                events in Denmark: the currency problem.
                <br>
                <br>Even in Oldenburg, Oeder remained a sharp observer of the financial policies of European states. In
                1787, he published his major essay On Paper Money. This work not only demonstrates Oeder’s financial
                foresight but also offers valuable insight into the financial policies and theories of the time, shortly
                before the outbreak of the French Revolution — at a moment when France was already on the brink of chaos
                due to Necker’s flawed credit policies. Yet this essay, too, was written with Denmark in mind, even
                though the country is not mentioned by name. Oeder felt, as he wrote on January 22, 1788, to Duke Peter
                Friedrich Ludwig of Oldenburg, fully capable of mastering the Danish financial chaos of the time, which
                had arisen in no small part due to the issuance of paper money. He regarded his essay — “in which
                Denmark truly served me as the original of the painting” — as the appropriate theoretical foundation. He
                even asked the Duke to draw attention to it in St. Petersburg. However, he wished to remain anonymous.
                Only a year later did he explicitly reveal his authorship in another essay. The Duke, for his part,
                remarked with reference to Russia that “the age of iron” now reigned there, and he did not know whether
                the “charming paper” would be granted any credit.
                <br>
                <br>What, then, are Oeder’s key ideas? Paper money has the advantages of the bill of exchange, which
                likewise substitutes paper for coin. But a bill of exchange is directed at a specific person. If this is
                generalized, one arrives at the concept of paper money, in which no single individual appears as the
                recipient of the paper, but rather one proceeds to “consider whoever holds the paper to be its owner,
                and thus attribute to the paper the full quality of money that passes from hand to hand without formal
                transfer.” For the issuer — the emitter — paper money also possesses the power to create an “artificial
                wealth”; it acts as a money-creating instrument like the bill of exchange, since the “supply of coined
                money,” i.e., the gold or silver held in reserve, does not need to be as large as the nominal value of
                the paper money in circulation. With the surplus of paper money over the reserve, with the money thus
                created, one can operate.
                <br>
                <br>These are — greatly simplified — the foundational ideas with which Oeder begins his argument. Ideas
                that remained standard concepts for every financial expert well into the 20th century, and which have
                only ceased to be as immediately relevant in our time, now that we have different notions of currency
                backing — where the guarantee of a currency’s stability is no longer seen in its gold backing but in
                wise economic policy. In Oeder’s time, these ideas were far from self-evident. Financial science had to
                laboriously develop its theoretical foundations.
                <br>
                <br>But the decisive thought expressed by Oeder, which follows now, has — mutatis mutandis — not lost
                its validity to this day:
                <br>
                <br>“From the beginning and thereafter, always and hourly, in all general operations and in the
                operations of each day, the director of a note bank must be mindful that the entire existence of his
                bank rests on opinion — on the conviction, confirmed through experience, of every note holder that his
                note is as good as coined money, and that he can convert it into coin at any moment as he pleases.”
                <br>
                <br>This sentence means nothing other than: currency stability rests on the population’s trust in the
                stability of the currency.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder now draws various conclusions from this core idea of his essay:
                <br>
                <br>The issuance of paper money is a matter for the state. On the one hand, the state has the right to
                enjoy for itself the benefits that arise from the ability to create money. On the other hand, it thereby
                has the opportunity to grant credit to the economy and thus stimulate it, without having to resort to
                the state treasury.
                <br>
                <br>This is followed by some still relevant reflections on the relationship between currency and imports
                and exports. If the economy expands to the point where exports exceed imports, then gold and silver flow
                into the country. At the same time — assuming free competition and free price formation — general
                prosperity increases due to the overall stimulation of exports and, in turn, of domestic trade. But with
                that, prices also rise, and interest rates fall.
                <br>
                <br>“This condition, comparable to the full-bloodedness of a healthy, well-nourished body, with its
                favorable and also adverse circumstances, is a natural consequence of commerce and the course of the
                world, in which government as a whole can do little. But a very different matter is the artificial
                increase in currency by means of paper money: the resulting condition is not full-bloodedness, but a
                bloated existence.”
                <br>
                <br>In this case, the fall in interest rates is by no means a self-evident consequence of the increase
                in the money supply. Oeder thus already senses certain dangers in the idea of a free economy — an idea
                that, originating in England, was especially promoted by Adam Smith and to which Oeder himself was quite
                committed — yet one which cannot function without various forms of credit creation. His conclusion, that
                paper money should only ever make up a small portion of the total money in circulation, may no longer
                seem compelling to us today. However, in a time when gold and silver coins were the norm and paper money
                something new, things looked very different.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder then, starting from the fact that “an estimate of the quantity of coin circulating in a nation
                with any certainty” is not possible, considers what proportion of paper money in circulation is still
                permissible. He links the volume of circulation to the state's revenues and believes it should not
                exceed a quarter of those revenues. A ratio of 3:1 seems appropriate to him as the relationship between
                paper money in circulation and its backing: that is, three times as much paper money can be issued as
                there is precious metal backing. A state that holds a treasury of precious metals can, instead of
                drawing on it directly, issue the same amount in paper money as it intended to spend in metals.
                <br>
                <br>Only in exceptional cases, in a severe state of emergency, does Oeder allow the state the right to
                increase the volume of paper money — but only ever for a very short time:
                <br>
                <br>“Although it is always a desperate measure.”He points out that even Frederick II of Prussia did not
                resort to this method during the greatest crises of the Seven Years’ War.
                <br>
                <br>Under no circumstances should paper money be issued to cover a gap between higher expenditures and
                lower revenues:
                <br>
                <br>“In this respect, the invention of paper money is the most dubious and unfortunate invention that
                finance has ever devised.”Because issuing paper money means going into debt. It is such a convenient
                escape when money appears to be needed. The notion that this kind of debt does not carry interest leads
                to“a lulling of concern for the future, a readiness to spend — on undertakings which, although good
                under certain conditions, are not suited to the circumstances of the time, nor carried out with proper
                frugality, and would be avoided if the difficulty of raising funds aroused and reinforced a wholesome
                sense of caution.”
                <br>
                <br>In essence, the creditor is “the public”, the population — and once awakened, it is
                <br>
                <br>“the most inconvenient and unruly of all creditors.”This moment comes when“the opinion that a note
                is as good as coin”is shaken — in other words, when trust in the currency ceases to exist. The result is
                rising prices. This is the point at which people today typically begin to “flee into tangible assets”.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder concludes with two warnings:
                <br>
                <br>“The accumulation of notes in the service of a state that does not know how to meet its needs with
                hard cash is an anticipation of its revenues — often for many years to come.”“In public administration,
                as in private households, there is no other remedy for debt than to pay.”
                <br>
                <br>Even if not in every detail, the fundamental ideas of this essay can never become entirely outdated.
                Schlözer seems to have recognized this as well. The clear line of reasoning, unclouded by prejudice or
                wishful thinking, presented a situation that was by no means self-evident to the statesmen of his
                time—and which even today, despite the increasing scientific approach of our financial policy, is still
                often conveniently ignored.
                <br>
                <br>The essay published one year later, "On Banco, Courant, and Coin", does not continue these
                reflections but instead focuses solely on the relationship between the unit of account of a major
                bank—the banco thaler—and the actual circulating coin, the specie thaler, which as a coin is a commodity
                with a fluctuating price. This work too, however, demonstrates Oeder’s deep familiarity with the complex
                subject.
                <br>
                <br>The topic is taken up once more in an essay dated by Oeder himself to 30 October 1790—thus completed
                exactly a quarter of a year before his death—entitled "Thoughts on Paper Money". This essay shows, more
                clearly than the first, that neither Oeder nor his contemporaries had yet accepted paper money as
                something self-evident, but still regarded it as a temporary expedient that should be removed again as
                soon as possible.
                <br>
                <br>On the whole, this work does not add much new compared to the first. What is newly recognized is
                that even precious metal coinage has a symbolic character. The value of precious metal also rests on
                trust, for “the value of the symbol rests on the certainty of fulfillment of the promise.” Unlike paper
                money, however, precious metals are recognized throughout the civilized world as a measure of value,
                “and through the inimitability of their substance, they are protected against undetectable
                counterfeiting.” The value of paper money, “in which the substance means nothing and the form is
                everything,” rests solely on opinion, on trust. If introduced by force, this trust is immediately
                undermined.
                <br>
                <br>The question of whether private or state banks are preferable no longer seems to him as clearly
                answered in favor of state banks as it had in his 1789 essay, since private banks also always remain
                linked to the state. Otherwise, the essay primarily addresses the relationship between circulating money
                and its backing. The connection between the increase of paper money and the costliness of modern warfare
                is clearly recognized. Oeder distinguishes between the borrowing system, which he characterizes as
                English, and the savings-based system, more Prussian in nature, which does not rely on paper money for
                war financing. He discusses the high English national debt and shows how and why indebted states can and
                must establish a sinking fund. He always maintains the position that state finances and the monetary
                affairs of the economy must, in any case, remain separate. He then discusses in detail the question of
                how paper money, which immediately displaces coined money, can be removed again. The only means he sees
                is the conversion from payment at sight to deferred payment. Only once paper money has disappeared can
                coinage resume.
                <br>
                The conclusion of the essay shows that Oeder had now turned his full attention to developments in
                France, where, on December 19, 1789, the assignats were introduced, and on September 29, 1790 — just
                four weeks before Oeder completed his essay — they were converted into inconvertible legal tender: paper
                money as unbacked fiat currency. Oeder’s death prevented any further engagement with France’s financial
                policy. He did not live to see the confirmation of his theories: the inflation that became inevitable in
                1793 when the printing press was set in motion to finance war. Nevertheless, it is of no small interest
                how the old man assessed these developments during the final months of his life. Among other things, he
                writes:
                <br>
                <br>“Of the circulation of a multitude of instruments of obligation, amounting perhaps to a total
                equivalent to all the gold and silver existing in the world, and all equally close to realization, and
                therefore also all equally distant from realization — of such a circulation I have no conception; and
                the image of the confusion to be expected from it is dreadful to my imagination. For example, I cannot
                comprehend how, in the presence of such an extravagant quantity of paper money, metallic currency could
                continue to exist; nor do I understand how — even if a state could forego metallic money for domestic
                transactions — it would conduct its foreign trade without it, or meet its political obligations to the
                rest of the world: for it surely remains true — or at least I cannot rid myself of this old-fashioned
                belief — that only that is real money which is recognized as such throughout the entire world, and only
                real money is the nervus rerum gerendarum.”
                <br>
                <br>He continues by summing up the precarious situation of the French National Assembly in just a few
                sentences:
                <br>
                <br>“All in all, I cannot, at present, place trust in the operations of an assembly of men (even if they
                are the wisest of the nation) that has not yet succeeded in founding an executive power placed beyond
                contradiction and resistance — without which power, their resolutions (not to mention that they are all
                reforms akin to a new creation, that they follow each other too rapidly, and delve into detail too
                early, instead of first establishing the simple but fruitful fundamental laws needed at the beginning of
                this new state of things, from which — later, and with the leisure required for mature reflection — the
                details could organically emerge) — without such power, their resolutions are, in essence, nothing but
                theories. I cannot place trust in the operations of an assembly whose existence is precarious, for the
                duration of its session is not defined by law, and after the possible dissolution of this first
                assembly, the formation of a second — and even more so, the resolutions of such a second assembly —
                would be exposed to all manner of difficulties.”
                <br>
                <br>Here, just a few weeks before his death, speaks once more the seasoned practitioner of politics,
                administration, and public finance, who, in the final moments of his life, is confronted with the new
                and momentous developments in France — developments that he partially accepts, as he does not reject the
                Revolution outright (indeed, it realizes many of the aims his rational mind had long regarded as
                desirable). Yet he also immediately perceives its weaknesses and senses that something entirely new is
                unfolding — something of which he can “form no conception.”

                <br>
                <br>Oeder also concerned himself, in the end, with the question of how to protect paper money from
                imitation and forgery. According to von Halem, he was “in negotiation with several governments” on this
                subject in his final years. After his death, the relevant papers were immediately sealed, and awaited a
                ruler “who would value the ideas a man like Oeder held on so important a matter enough not to let them
                be lost.” — Where these papers ended up, and what Oeder’s ideas were, could not be ascertained.
                <br>
                <br>The last time we hear Oeder’s voice is in a letter dated December 18, 1790, likely addressed to
                Schlözer and later published by him. In it, Oeder outlines how he envisions a solution to France’s
                financial crisis. Everything, he says, depends on “removing from the contracted debt [i.e., the
                assignats, which were originally interest-bearing promissory notes] the character of money.” He then
                recounts the story of a Danish gang of currency forgers — a case that could easily have taken place in
                our own times.


                <br>
                <br>Finally, mention must be made of an undated and apparently unpublished memorandum by Oeder on the
                banking system, found in his correspondence with Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig of Oldenburg and evidently
                intended for the Duke alone. It probably dates from around 1788. Here, Oeder states that he has no faith
                in state banks:
                <br>
                <br>“I hold that any mixing of state financial business with the monetary dealings of the subjects is
                wholly inadvisable — I have no faith in the great cauldrons, where so much is stirred together that
                afterwards cannot be separated.”
                <br>
                <br>He distinguishes these from credit banks, writing:
                <br>
                <br>“I consider loan banks as something that pertains neither to finance nor to commerce, but to
                policing — something that should not, on the financial side, concern the government at all.”
                <br>
                <br>Here again, we see his attempt to draw clear boundaries between different branches of state
                administration, with loan banks treated as a kind of welfare institution — comparable to savings banks
                and pension funds.
                <br>
                <br>He goes on to discuss conditions in Denmark, where a new bank was being founded “in the hope that it
                will provide funds to redeem the old bank [the Copenhagen Bank of 1736].” He categorically rejects this
                attempt to plug one hole with another and also criticizes the secrecy and supposed profundity of finance
                — “a nimbus that disappears before the eye of philosophy.” Otherwise, the memorandum offers no
                fundamentally new ideas.

                Georg Christian von Oeder died after six weeks of illness on 28 January 1791. On 31 January, the
                Oldenburg Government Chancellery reported his death to Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig. On 11 February 1791,
                Oeder’s widow wrote to the Duke, thanking him for his grace and sympathy during her husband’s illness
                and passing, and thereafter — a sympathy which, next to her faith, had been her greatest comfort. She
                commended her two still underage sons to his grace.
                <br>
                <br>Oeder thus died only a few days before completing his 64th year — still relatively young. Yet what a
                rich life was encompassed in those few decades! His life may be divided into three nearly equal periods:
                the years of youth and education, the Danish period, and the time in Oldenburg.
                <br>
                <br>The preceding account will surely have shown that Oeder himself — though he does not appear to have
                felt genuinely unhappy in Oldenburg — must have regarded the middle, Danish period, which came to an end
                already in his forty-fifth year, as the pinnacle of his life, in comparison to which his work in
                Oldenburg could only be seen as a descent.

            </section>
            <section id="chap18">
                <h3 id="kap18"></h3>
                Describing Oeder’s personality, as it is expressed in his works and letters, is no easy task. He was
                certainly the “projector” people made him out to be — but in the best sense of the word: a man of
                imagination and insight, with the ability to break through conventions in thought and get to the bottom
                of things. Yet all this operated in a very sober manner, always within the bounds of the immediately
                perceptible world. It was this reality that he sought to shape, to improve, to reform for the common
                good. Oeder never lost touch with reality. And in his undoubtedly sincere concern for the public
                welfare, he seemingly never forgot himself. The utopian thinking and visionary schemes of many other
                projectors and clever minds were alien to him. In general, he was probably not what one would call
                witty. Feelings only become visible in him when he is under attack. His relationship to religion remains
                completely obscure. In all the writings available to me, there is not a single mention of God. When his
                wife spoke after his death of the consolation of religion, it strikes one who has studied this man at
                length almost as a surprise. Nor is there any visible connection to the irrational, let alone to the
                mystical or mythical.
                <br>
                <br>Here was a man, then, with restrained imagination, with an inventive mind always directed toward
                concrete objects, who quickly grasped and penetrated new problems: this explains how Oeder, in the few
                years of his most effective activity, could almost playfully engage with botany and zoology, insurance
                mathematics, economics, administration, the social condition of the peasantry, military policy, fiscal
                policy, statistics, and land surveying. One never gets the impression that a dilettante, in the negative
                sense, was at work. What he said was always thoughtful, often new, often far ahead of his time, often
                stepping beyond speculation into the realm of practical reform and innovation.
                <br>
                <br>If one attempts to summarize the results of Oeder’s life and view his work as a whole, it can be
                said that everything he created, proposed, or inspired beyond his narrower field of botany is, like a
                bud, already contained in the “Bedenken” of the 41-year-old from 1769. These 74 pages — themselves a
                product of his Danish and Norwegian travels — condense his entire experience into a coherent vision of
                state reform pointing well into the 19th century. All later writings, not only the “Additions” and
                “Supplements” to the “Bedenken”, are essentially already foreshadowed here. While the central aim of
                this cautiously worded text is the redistribution of land in favor of independent freeholders, this is
                already linked to the issues of population growth and the stimulation of trade, industry, and
                manufacturing, as well as the reorganization of the military. All layers of society are included in the
                conception — from the nobility to the cottagers. From this new agrarian order follows naturally the need
                for land surveying and population statistics. From there, it is only a step to administrative reform,
                especially in finance and taxation, to the regulation of poor relief, to the creation of widows’,
                orphans’, and annuity funds, to savings banks as self-help institutions, to a comprehensive financial
                and monetary policy — all with the goal of illuminating and enabling the great economic and social
                transformation that Oeder ultimately strove for, and to master the challenges posed by the present and
                the future.
                <br>
                <br>In the 18th century, long before the French Revolution, developments were already underway that
                would only fully unfold in the 19th century — some of which, like the parceling out of large estates,
                are already being reversed under today’s different economic and social conditions. In the spirit of the
                18th century, Oeder stands as one of the great creative figures who gave impulses, drove development
                forward, and helped prepare the way into the 19th century. A rationalist to be sure, in whose worldview
                — as far as we can tell — neither God nor Devil, neither emotion nor mood, had any place, but a
                rationalist whose inner drive to go further, to explore and shape ever-new areas, certainly drew from
                irrational depths of the soul, from an inborn, not rationally explicable urge to do good in his world.
                <br>
                <br>Such a man could justly say of himself what Gerhard Anton von Halem reports from Oeder’s unfinished
                and apparently lost memoirs: “I can make room for the thought — a thought most pleasing and satisfying
                to a man who feels the value of life and existence — of not having lived without usefulness in the
                world.”
