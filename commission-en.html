                <h2>
                    Preliminary Report.
                </h2>
                Upon the very appearance, in the year 1786, of the publication Documents and Materials for a Closer
                Understanding of the History and State Administration of Northern Kingdoms, which came out without
                naming its editor or indicating its place of printing, I felt, on account of the pieces contained
                therein concerning the Finance College established in Copenhagen in the year 1771 with three subordinate
                chambers:
                <br>
                <br>namely, under the heading "Finance Matters": the items I, II, III, IV, V, from pp. 265 to 278, and
                <br>
                <br>under the heading "Appendix", in item I, section no. 3, from pp. 529 to 536,
                <br>
                <br>I felt—since it is known to everyone in Denmark that the idea for the aforementioned Finance College
                originally came from me, even though it was not fully executed according to my proposal—the necessity to
                set my share in the matter, as well as this part of my existence in Denmark, in its proper light.
                <br>
                <br>In the meantime, however, various considerations had moved me to postpone the aforementioned
                disclosure until now; but those considerations no longer apply.
                <br>
                <br>The disclosure consists in the public presentation of a memorandum submitted to a commission that
                had been expressly appointed to investigate the changes which, at that time, had occurred in and with
                the departments.
                <br>
                <br>I submitted it to this commission a few days after its establishment became known, unprompted,
                because I considered it my duty to declare myself as the originator of the idea of such a Finance
                College with three subordinate chambers, and, in justifying myself voluntarily—so far as the
                justification could rightly fall upon me in view of the manner in which it had in fact been executed—at
                the same time to present to a commission, which had been instructed not to reject anything merely
                because it was new, if otherwise good, the reasons for the institution. — I submitted it, as stated, out
                of a sense of duty, not from any need for a means of defense, for no such need existed.
                <br>
                <br>Even now I believe that, in addition to the previously stated motive for publishing this essay —
                namely, to bring this part of my existence in Denmark into its proper light, in which it does not appear
                as such in the printed volume in question — I may also add a motive that relates not only to myself but
                also to the state, to which I have endeavored to render faithful service. For it may already matter to
                more than one Danish patriot, and will surely not be indifferent to the future historian — particularly
                of the period into which this Finance College with its chambers falls — to know the reasons for its
                establishment. At the very least, one will not fail to recognize the systematic nature of its design,
                and — many things will be reborn that have now fallen, and those which are now held in honor will fall.
                <br>
                <br>I especially flatter myself with the thought that the Norwegian Chamber, brief though its existence
                was, will be held in good remembrance among the Norwegians, and that in particular the inhabitants of
                the southern part of that kingdom, enjoying the freedom of grain trade restored to them in 1788, will
                recall the similar liberty brought about by the Norwegian Chamber in the year 1771 — to be sure, a
                freedom at first granted only for the 9 years up to 1780, since that Chamber sought to pave the way
                toward permanent permission through the experience of those years, and through the appeal — made so
                necessary by the known oppositions — to that very experience.
                <br>
                <br>In the year 1772, moreover, while engaged in other preparations for assuming the office of Diocesan
                Governor in Drontheim, I was at that very time contemplating a plan for district granaries in the Amt of
                Drontheim (since the Diocesan Governor is known to be simultaneously the governor of one of the diocesan
                districts), granaries that are indispensable for every region whose population depends on supplies —
                when my appointment, very much against my wish and inclination, was unexpectedly altered.
                <br>
                <br>Oldenburg, 13 June 1790.
                <br>
                <br>G. C. von Oeder.

                    I. Memorandum submitted in the year 1772 in Copenhagen
                    <br>to the commission that had been expressly appointed
                    <br>to investigate the changes which, since October
                    <br>1770, had occurred in and with the colleges.

                </h2>
                By a cabinet order dated 4 January 1771, I was placed in such a position and connection with the Cabinet
                as gave me the opportunity to express my thoughts on various parts of the state administration—thoughts
                which, with or without my knowledge, may have had influence on those matters which are now assigned to
                the Royal Commission for investigation. I therefore consider it as useful as it is my duty to lay before
                the aforementioned Commission the memoranda concerning the Finance College, the chambers, and the
                affairs entrusted to these colleges.
                <br>
                <br>I assisted the man to whom the King, as with so many others, referred me and placed over me, with my
                counsel, according to my best knowledge and conscience, and the papers from my hand, which have
                presumably been found, must bear witness to this—just as my friend, Mr. Conference Councillor
                Schumacher, who initialed the aforementioned cabinet order, can also bear witness.
                <br>
                <br>The structure of the Finance College and its chambers quoad formam (as to its form) is my own idea;
                yet I had no part in the cabinet order that gave this college its existence, and I knew nothing of its
                establishment—nor that I was to be appointed to it—until the evening when the order, sent to and opened
                by its recipient, was made known to me.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, as already stated, with respect to the Finance College’s organization quoad formam, I still
                maintain that it is good and deserves to be preserved, based on the reasons set forth in Appendix No. 1.
                But regarding various matters that were assigned to the Finance College, I have always held a different
                opinion.
                <br>
                <br>On various occasions afforded by the position mentioned above, I presented—both orally and in
                writing—that in my opinion, the administration of customs duties should indeed be combined with the
                management of the other royal revenues; but that, by contrast, for matters concerning commerce and
                manufacturing—or, more precisely, for public political economy as a whole—and for the administration of
                the subjects’ means of subsistence, which is the responsibility of the government, there must exist a
                separate department. A petition signed by more than 30 merchants from the Diocese of Aggershus,
                requesting the establishment of a Board of Commerce for Norway, was what principally led me to these
                ideas—this petition having been occasioned by a royal circular dated 16 October 1770. My proposal, by
                which I believed the wishes of the Norwegians in this regard could be fulfilled, is to be seen in
                Appendix No. 3.
                <br>
                <br>In my opinion, among the matters of police (i.e., public regulation) which were, by the ordinance of
                19 August 1771, taken away from the Chancellery and transferred to the Finance College and the chambers,
                some do indeed belong there more appropriately than to the Chancellery. But the majority belong under an
                Economic College, and a portion again is of such a mixed nature that it is difficult to decide whether
                they fall under economic or juridical police. The best solution, therefore, would be for members from
                various departments to be assembled and for these doubtful matters to be administered jointly by them.
                <br>
                <br>To summarize my thoughts briefly: on the one hand, it is certainly true that oeconomia publica—the
                management of subjects’ means of subsistence—and the police (i.e., the order by which these means are
                maintained in vita sociali, social life), do not properly belong to cameralism, which primarily concerns
                itself with the fiscus principis, the sovereign’s treasury. On the other hand, it is equally true that
                oeconomia publica and police so closely affect the Finance College and its chambers in many respects
                that these two bodies must necessarily take part in their administration.
                <br>
                <br>On this basis rests my idea of an Economic College which would likewise be responsible for matters
                of police; and I take the liberty, under No. 4, of submitting my reasons for your kind consideration.

                    First Memorandum.
                </h2>
                Reasons for the Structure of the Finance College and the Three Chambers.
                <br>
                <br>To carry out the extensive affairs of the financial and cameral administration, it is necessary to
                separate them in such a way that their indissoluble connection is not disturbed. One must by no means
                underestimate the importance of detail, for in the end, the success of all business depends on detail.
                But one cannot expect those responsible for the detail also to maintain an overview of the whole in its
                interconnections.
                <br>
                <br>Likewise, those entrusted with oversight of the whole should not be expected to delve into the
                details—except in the most important cases.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, financial affairs and chamber affairs must be distinguished. Financial affairs are: the
                allocation of the state's revenues; the general supervision of the sources of income; the modification
                of existing rules and regulations, and the introduction of new ones. Chamber affairs are: the collection
                of revenues; the particular administration of each and every source of income; and the application of
                existing rules and regulations to all individual and specific cases.
                <br>
                <br>By assigning a deputy to each chamber as supervisor, and composing the Finance College from these
                deputies, one achieves both the necessary separation and connection; and in considering the
                representations received by the Finance College from the chambers, the particular interest of each part
                of the state is assessed in its relation to the whole state: everything remains in proper order.
                <br>
                <br>This aforementioned connection would be disturbed if, as has been proposed, the Norwegian chamber
                were moved to Christiania and the German chamber to Rendsburg: in that case, one would have to grant
                these chambers expanded authority and assign to them a portion of the financial affairs. But how much
                authority, and which affairs? That would be difficult, and scarcely possible to determine otherwise than
                arbitrarily. The alleged and sole benefit of this relocation—namely, the possibility of better local
                knowledge if the chambers were located nearer to their districts—is in itself of no real value; for the
                chamber cannot travel, and its members are just as bound to their residence and meeting place in
                Christiania or Rendsburg as in Copenhagen, and the colleges can, in any case, proceed only on the basis
                of reports from subordinate authorities.
                <br>
                <br>The great benefit of the separation and division of the former single chamber into three distinct
                chambers is evident at a glance when one considers that now, in three rooms, what used to require three
                days—when all members of the single chamber sat at one table—can be accomplished in one day, and just as
                effectively, since no member is now obliged to spend their time and attention on matters foreign to
                them. Each of the three separate chambers consists of a number of members sufficient for collegial
                deliberation.
                <br>
                <br>Furthermore, the division of tasks within each chamber (an arrangement that is always good for
                government departments, though not for judicial tribunals) has the significant advantage that each
                member is compelled to deepen their expertise in their respective sphere, since they are personally
                responsible for it.
                <br>
                <br>As the commissioners of each chamber present their own reports, while the rent writers serve merely
                as calculators, the former act in accordance with the dignity of their office, and the college, which
                must see through their eyes, perceives more reliably. The rent writers, no longer distracted by the
                revision of accounts, can bring such revisions to a timely conclusion, thereby avoiding the disadvantage
                of outdated accounts, which is the greatest problem in chamber affairs.
                <br>
                <br>Through the secretaries, who are assigned as indispensable assistants both to the deputies of the
                Finance Collegium in their role as chamber heads and to the commissioners as bureau chiefs, as well as
                through the copyists—who are intended to be recruited from among the educated—the entire finance-chamber
                department possesses a training ground of capable and well-prepared individuals for positions belonging
                to this department.

                <br>72 persons / 121

                <br>The arrangement necessary for the reorganization cost a fair amount, approximately 2100 Rixdollars;
                however, most of this was for acquiring inventory items or for expenses that occur only once and will
                not be needed again soon. The smallest portion was spent on writing materials. Consequently, this
                expense cannot reasonably be charged to the new arrangement.
                <br>
                <br>Nor should the personnel brought in due to the reorganization be considered, as they are merely res
                temporaria (temporary measures), and some have already ceased service; for such departmental changes
                rarely occur without involving pensioners.
                <br>
                <br>Therefore, it would be unreasonable to estimate the excess cost of the new arrangement over the old
                one at more than 4000 Rixdollars.
                <br>
                <br>On the other hand, instead of 72, there are now 121 people in active and ongoing service — not
                counting the offices and their attendants, which have not been changed at all.
                <br>
                <br>With such a much greater number of workers — not so much directing minds as working hands — and by
                restricting the leading figures of each chamber solely to their own duties, without being distracted by
                the affairs of the other chambers, a much swifter and more orderly handling of all matters is achieved.
                Everything is considered and processed more thoroughly and precisely. That this has truly taken place,
                and has clearly manifested itself in a short time, no one will be able to deny. Nor do I believe that
                those who served under the previous arrangement — such as State Councillors B. and C., the Justices O.
                and P., among others — will say otherwise.

                <h2>
                    Memoire Nro. 3.

                </h2>
                <h3>§. 1.</h3>
                One may reasonably expect of well-intentioned servants of the state and well-intentioned subjects that
                they will never forget how inseparably the interests of the government and those of the subjects are
                connected;
                <br>
                <br>but it is also certain that human insight is limited and human passions strong.
                <br>
                <br>Ministers are often tempted to deliberately avert their eyes from the welfare of the subjects, when
                wastefulness and vain ambitions or plans — which do not correspond to the state's capabilities — demand
                greater expenditures than the sources of those capabilities, the means of subsistence, can bear;
                <br>
                <br>often — and I hope this is more frequently the case than the former — ministers err in good faith,
                and, acting with the best intentions in seeking to assist on one front and promote a particular line of
                subsistence, end up placing shackles on industrious efforts in many others.
                <h3>§. 2.</h3>

                It is therefore never advisable for the servants of the state, who are appointed to oversee the state's
                revenues, to also have — solely and one-sidedly — the direction of the trade and industry of the
                subjects;
                and even the mere mistrust of the subjects, which they must expect in such a case, should alone deter
                them from assuming such a one-sided oversight.

                <h3>§. 3.</h3>

                On the other hand, experience teaches to what extent subjects, in their trade and industry, always seek
                to evade the duty incumbent upon them — namely, to grant the state a due share of the fruits of their
                labor,
                and how readily they are inclined to present proposals aimed solely at their own advantage;
                furthermore, the economic sector not only requires the protection of the government, but also, on a
                daily basis, support from the public treasury (aerarium publicum):
                thus, those entrusted with the administration of the aerarium publicum must necessarily also be involved
                in overseeing the economic sector.

                <h3>§. 4.</h3>

                It is so often heard and read that trade and manufacturing in monarchical states cannot be brought to
                any significant level,
                because freedom is lacking, as is consistency in the ministry's plans — a lack which continually
                disrupts all the speculations and investments of merchants,
                and because the directing ministry lacks sufficient knowledge of the details of the economic paths — a
                deficiency not remedied by the ministry having a few merchants or manufacturers as favorites at hand.

                <h3>§. 5.</h3>

                It is also certain that the governance of the economic estate requires detailed knowledge more than
                other parts of state administration.
                A collegium cannot expect to obtain this knowledge merely from the reports and considerations of
                subordinate authorities,
                for the economic activity of one subject is interconnected in many ways with that of his fellow
                citizens,
                and they too must be heard on each occasion.
                In such deliberations, a collegium is in a difficult position and considerably burdened,
                if it is to receive all petitions and projects already in the first instance — of which there are more
                in this department than in any other.
                But if intermediate instances are assigned,
                where all petitions and proposals must first be submitted and discussed,
                and only the important ones, properly prepared, may be submitted to higher authority,
                then an economic collegium can consider itself truly capable of managing the whole complex machinery.
                On these considerations, §§ 1–5 taken together, is founded the idea of a general economic collegium here
                in the residence,
                and of a special collegium for Norway in Christiania,
                which I have proposed in connection with the aforementioned petition of the merchants in Aggershus
                diocese.

                <h3>§. 6.</h3>

                In each of the four districts (stifter), an economic deputation would be established, consisting of a
                few of the most prominent royal officials and several of the wealthiest and most respected private
                individuals — merchants, manufacturers, mine owners, landowners, and the like — along with a secretary.
                The secretary is also a royal servant and is paid by the King, and both he and the royal officials hold
                permanent positions in the commission. They act therein in the King's stead, as Gens du Roy; however,
                those who join from the side of the subjects are replaced one by one and new members are elected by the
                subjects themselves. Execution remains in the hands of the Gens du Roy, but the private members — or, if
                I may call them so, delegati subditorum — are not merely consultants, but have the right not only to
                offer unsolicited proposals, but also to raise remonstrances and to demand, depending on the
                circumstances of each case, that these be referred to a higher instance. They also have the right to be
                informed of and acquainted with everything done in the deputation.
                <br>
                <br>Furthermore, an economic collegium for the entire kingdom of Norway will be convened and established
                in Christiania, into which one delegate from each district shall be admitted on behalf of the subjects.
                This delegate is appointed by his district’s deputation — namely, by the members therein representing
                the subjects — is paid by his constituents, and is accountable to them. Finally, all of Norway has its
                representative in the General Commerce Collegium in Copenhagen, who is appointed by the Norwegian
                Economic Collegium.
                <br>
                <br>The King will not be burdened with any additional expenses beyond the salaries of five secretaries,
                and these costs should not be considered burdensome, for qui vult finem, vult media — he who desires the
                end must also desire the means! These secretaries could at the same time serve as government secretaries
                to the district governors, thereby also providing some relief to these truly distinguished officials,
                who surely stand in need of it.
                <br>
                <br>As for the membra delegata a subditis (delegated members from among the subjects), it is possible
                that individuals will be found who would take on this post without compensation — especially if it
                should please the King to designate it a poste d'honneur (honorary position). However, if no such
                individuals are found, then the inhabitants of each district must pool the necessary funds themselves,
                and they will presumably not shy away from this expenditure if they consider the importance of the
                privilege the King grants them by admitting them ad consilia — into deliberations — on matters as
                important as their means of livelihood.

                    Memoire Nro. 4.

                </h2>
                The college I envision in my mind is not merely a commerce college, but an economy and police college.
                The word economy encompasses trade as well as all other branches of the productive (or subsistence)
                class. The purpose of this college is, as an economy college, to protect and support the productive
                class, and as a police college, to maintain proper order within it.
                <br>
                <br>It would consist of...
                <br>
                <br>1. By a deputy, who would act as the college’s rapporteur in the Council of State and as a deputy in
                the Finance College, and in this capacity would receive a salary.
                <br>
                <br>2. By a commissioner responsible for all generalia relating to the production of natural goods from
                land and water, as well as to commerce.
                <br>
                <br>3. By a commissioner responsible for all generalia concerning manufacturing (factory operations),
                and these two commissioners would be salaried as members of this college.
                <br>
                <br>4. 5. 6. By a commissioner from each chamber to handle the specialia and individualia occurring
                within the district of his chamber; these commissioners would each be paid as members of their
                respective chambers.
                <br>
                <br>For the handling of police matters, specific days would be set aside, and on these, two members of
                the Danish Chancellery and one member of the German Chancellery would join, without any additional
                salary beyond what they already receive as deputies of their respective chanceries.
                <br>
                <br>Deputy No. 1 uses the departmental secretary and copyist assigned to him in the Finance College.
                <br>
                <br>Deputy No. 2 is assigned a bureau secretary and a copyist; his bureau is responsible for company
                trade and consular affairs.
                <br>
                <br>Commissioner No. 3 is likewise assigned a bureau secretary and a copyist, and his bureau oversees
                manufacturing affairs in general, and those of Copenhagen in particular.
                <br>
                <br>All official issuances of the college are dispatched from these two bureaus.
                <br>
                <br>Commissioners No. 4, 5, and 6 each make use of the bureau secretary and copyist assigned to them in
                their respective chambers.
                <br>
                <br>In their bureaus, all casus speciales (special cases) arising in the districts of each chamber are
                handled, and from there brought forward for deliberation in the college; they also particularly handle
                police matters, such as guild disputes and similar issues.
                <br>
                <br>It is primarily to these commissioners that the aforementioned delegati provinciarum relate.
                <br>
                <br>These delegates are granted seat and vote in the college in matters that concern the interests of
                their respective commissioners.
                <br>
                <br>In this way, no one needs to be displaced. I consider it better to let Commissioners No. 4, 5, and 6
                remain in their chambers rather than to remove them entirely, since they can serve as the link for
                maintaining the highly useful and necessary connection and good understanding between the colleges.
                <br>
                <br>Two new commissioner salaries and one additional secretary salary will be required — that is true;
                but just as it is true that the Royal Treasury must be spared unnecessary expenses, I also believe that
                such an expense cannot be counted among the unnecessary — one that is applied to provide this college
                with its proper constitution, a college which, if good principles are adopted along with the form, may
                particularly promote the welfare of the state and increase the royal revenues by improving the sources
                from which they flow.

                    Response to certain objections against the current constitution of the Finance College and the
                    Chambers

                <h4 id="chap8">
                    I. Concerning the Archives

                </h4>
                Objection. Three archives and three archivists, with a clerk and a copyist, are said to be a
                multiplicatio entium (an unnecessary multiplication of entities).
                <br>
                <br>Reply. If the chambers are to be divided, then the archives must be as well; the question thus
                becomes whether the division of the chambers is useful? However, I will not even cite this motive here,
                lest someone accuse me of a petitio principii (begging the question).
                <br>
                <br>But whether one assumes a single undivided chamber or three separate ones, I assert that a reform of
                the chamber archive is in any case equally necessary.
                <br>
                <br>It is surely still fresh in everyone's memory how all the rent-writer offices in the former rent
                chamber were filled to the brim with papers. That is to say, each office had its own archive, and
                recourse to the general chamber archive was only very rarely needed, since the offices kept their own
                records over long periods, many from the beginning of this century, and even some dating from the
                previous century. In that way, it was relatively easy for a single archivist, with the help of a clerk
                and two scribes, to manage the general archive to some degree.
                <br>
                <br>But what was the state of things in the offices themselves? Can that be called order? And has anyone
                ever considered reforming the archive and discarding outdated documents? Has anyone ever established
                proper principles to determine what should be preserved in the archive and what should be discarded?
                <br>
                <br>It is impossible to imagine that anyone would suggest all papers should be preserved in the
                future—for then more than one building the size of the Chancellery would eventually be required just for
                the Chamber’s archive. How crammed that building is was revealed when the archives were to be removed
                from the offices, and no place could be found to set anything down.
                <br>
                <br>If the Chamber archive is to be properly ordered, then space must first be created in the vaults,
                and the bundles already placed there—those moved from the offices last summer—must likewise be reviewed
                in order to separate the dispensable from the indispensable. A similar separation must be introduced for
                the future. This separation, this selection of the useful and the unnecessary, must be undertaken with
                mature critique and great caution, and indeed according to sound principles, good method, and
                classification. Very precise registers must be created for both the useful and the useless items, such
                that each chamber can then decide what is to be preserved or discarded, and this work must be divided
                among several individuals if it is ever to be completed.
                <br>
                <br>Accordingly, our three archivists, if we know and are willing to put them to proper work, will have
                enough to do for many years with their assigned assistants. And should these archivists in time become
                superfluous, once the archives are brought into order, perhaps each chamber’s expeditions secretary
                could then manage the archive, with the help of the clerk and copyist assigned to each archive.
                <br>
                <br>I cannot believe that anyone would refer me to the example of the Chancelleries—namely, that just as
                one archivist suffices for each of them, so too should the Finance College and its chambers be content
                with one archive; for the difference between these departments, in terms of the extent of their
                operations and the volume of documents arising from them, is far too obvious. In this regard, each of
                the three chambers could quite justifiably be compared to one of the Chancelleries.

                <h4 id="chap9">
                    II. Regarding the correspondence of the Rente-Schreiber (Revenue Clerks).

                </h4>
                Objection. It is claimed that the Rente-Schreiber have been stripped of their correspondence duties, and
                thereby also of the information which is necessary—indeed essential—for them regarding the accounts.

                <br>Reply. One must simply form a proper understanding of what a Rente-Schreiber was under the former
                constitution and what he is under the current arrangement.

                <br>Under the previous system, a Rente-Schreiber was both a reviewer of the accounts and also the
                secretary of the collegium in all other chamber matters not related to accounting. Under the present
                system, he is only a reviewer and calculator—or, if one prefers, a secretary for matters of
                accounting—whereas the present chamber secretaries are the secretaries of the collegium in all other
                chamber matters.

                <br>As for the correspondence related to the settlement of accounts, the Rente-Schreiber still carry out
                this correspondence, and in this area of chamber affairs, they are just as much the collegium's
                secretaries as they were in the old rent chamber; at least this is so in the Norwegian chamber, and
                anyone who claims that they have been deprived of this correspondence is not telling the truth.

                <br>If anything arises in the other parts of the chamber's operations that affects the accounts, it is
                immediately communicated to the Rente-Schreiber by the bureau secretaries; not to mention that each
                Committé member, as the decision-maker, who oversees both the Rente-Schreiber and the secretaries, is
                aware of everything that occurs in his entire circle of chamber duties—and he needs the Rente-Schreiber
                and the secretary just as a man needs both of his hands.

                <br>If the objection I am here rejecting is meant to say that the Rente-Schreiber have no correspondence
                at all, then it is factually incorrect and untrue. But if the objection refers to the fact that the
                Rente-Schreiber is no longer the sole secretary assigned to his Committé member, then it amounts to the
                same as the following objection, which I will consider separately.
                <h4 id="chap10">
                    III. Regarding the secretary

                </h4>
                Objection. Why are so many chamber secretaries needed in the present chambers?
                <br>
                <br>Answer. The overall answer is short and clear: they are needed for everything else that the
                Rente-Schreiber are no longer used for. But I will elaborate on this answer a bit.
                <br>
                <br>The administration of royal revenues in terms of income and expenditure and the auditing of the
                related accounts constitutes a significant part of the cameral administration; but another equally
                significant part is the oversight of the sources of royal revenue, the maintenance of good order
                according to law and justice in all those countless daily occurrences where the chamber's sphere touches
                the other branches of government—where fiscus principis comes into connection, or even collision, with
                the rights and interests of the subjects, and where the King’s interest intersects or conflicts with
                that of the subjects. Every day, subjects are to receive replies to petitions and requests; every day,
                measures must be taken and executed; constant coordination is needed with other royal collegia or with
                their subordinate officials; and continuously, due to all this, representations must be made to His
                Majesty the King. For brevity's sake, I will call this part of the chamber's business governance
                matters, and the other part accounting matters. Of the letters and dispatches issued on post days and
                others, only a small portion concerns accounting matters; the far larger portion concerns governance
                matters, and for this, the chamber secretary of each chamber bureau is used.
                <br>
                <br>Assuming this, I now maintain:
                <br>
                <br>1. That no one can dutifully handle both auditing and secretariat functions at once.
                <br>
                <br>2. That the Rente-Schreiber, generally speaking, do not possess the qualifications necessary for
                governance matters that a secretary requires, as they are usually uneducated.
                <br>
                <br>3. That a Committé member cannot properly fulfill his important duties in both main parts unless he
                has a dedicated secretary for each of them.
                <br>
                <br>One of the greatest disadvantages in the cameral system is when accounts lie unsettled for a long
                time and become outdated; such delays cause the obstacles to grow greater and greater. After some time,
                the necessary clarifications are completely missing and may eventually no longer be obtainable. Those
                affected by it suffer, gain grounds for justified complaints, and often the royal treasury suffers as
                well. In addition, revision is not a desultory task; it suffers when the reviser is constantly
                interrupted and pulled away from it — which happens when the Rente-Schreiber must also serve as the
                college’s secretary in governmental matters, or even as a referent in the college. Revision is then
                often left to a Gevollmächtigter, gets delayed, and when such unresolved accounts accumulate,
                extraordinary revision offices must be established.
                <br>
                <br>The benefit of the current arrangement, where Rente-Schreiber deal solely with revision, will surely
                become evident this year — assuming, of course, that the arrangement is allowed to remain in force. That
                this benefit did not yet manifest in full measure last year is solely due to the relocation of the
                offices, as all persons working in them were temporarily hindered in their duties, especially in the
                Norwegian offices. Thus, it is rather to be wondered at that so much could nevertheless be accomplished,
                as noted in the report to the King.
                <br>
                <br>Without meaning to disparage the Rente-Schreiber, one may surely state what is, in the end, commonly
                known: namely, that they are usually untrained and routine-bound officials, for whom theory — if it ever
                arrives — always comes only afterwards, and only for those who, thanks to fortunate natural talents and
                diligent effort, eventually abstract a theory or general insights and concepts from long experience with
                the details.
                <br>
                <br>I know that among them there have been, and still are, such persons who have served as committé
                members with honor and distinction; but I also know that their capability would have reached a far
                higher level if they had enjoyed the benefits of education and theory, which follow from and are based
                on the sciences — a fact these worthy men themselves would not deny. For the fruitful administration of
                cameral affairs, a great deal of knowledge in the related sciences is necessary, from which the required
                enlightening insights must be drawn; much knowledge of history, which teaches us what other states have
                done in former times, and what still today is practiced by civilized and prosperous nations in similar
                cases. It is so necessary, so consistent with the prosperity and dignity of a college, to speak with
                that precision and thoroughness which only follows from mature insight and a trained mode of thinking,
                that cameral affairs truly deserve to be treated on the footing of a science; and the prejudice that
                scholars are less suited for office than practitioners should at last be discarded — as it is equally
                harmful to the state and degrading to the sciences.
                <i>
                    *) May those who still cling to the delusion that only practice can form capable men take to heart
                    this correct valuation of theory — coming from the pen of one of our country’s foremost practical
                    financiers and cameralists! But alas, theory is still almost universally neglected among us, and
                    instead one studies the Institutiones and Pandects.
                    <br></i>
                <br>What I have said about cameral affairs in general — namely that matters of account are only a
                part of them — applies even more strongly and with greater relevance to the office of a committé
                member, for it is by no means his most important task merely to be a decisor. No! It is in matters
                of governance that he must above all show himself to be a capable servant and advisor of the king.
                It is he who, in his jurisdiction, must examine the petitions of subjects, observe the king’s
                interest in its true relation to the interest of the state; he must make every case clear to his
                colleagues, present his thoughts and advice first, deliberate matters with them, and gain their
                support.
                <br>
                <br>He is to draft the royal resolutions and representations, and the replies to the subjects. Thus,
                it must be his essential duty — and his most honorable prerogative — to present, himself, the cases
                that arise within his jurisdiction; a duty he must not evade, a privilege he must not surrender. To
                fulfill this duty, he needs all possible assistance from the secretary assigned to him — one who
                must be able to extract the documents and articulate and put into writing the thoughts dictated by
                his committé member; and this cannot be expected of a rente-schreiber fully occupied with account
                revision. It is impossible for business to be handled properly if the committé member leaves the
                reporting to the rente-schreiber, and the rente-schreiber in turn leaves the revision to the agent.
