                <h3>§. 1.</h3>
                To one who considers the subject of this writing, through which I seek to merit the most honorable
                testimony of the esteemed faculty and the highest honors in medicine, the question of derivation and
                revulsion through bloodletting presents itself as a matter renowned in all times and, even in more
                recent times, a subject of many disputations among great physicians.
                <br>
                <br>Medicine has not been equipped with any aid more powerful against numerous diseases than
                bloodletting. Therefore, no questions are more noble than those concerning bloodletting, nor are any of
                greater importance to the student of medicine — especially with regard to the aim to which the entire
                art is devoted: the health of mankind.
                <br>
                <br>Nor is it permissible for one who is himself to apply his hand to healing to avoid the burden of
                effort or, out of fear that by siding with one party of the disputants he may incur the enmity of the
                other, to refrain from examining the opposing views. Rather, he ought to be guided by sound reason and
                by counsel that is consistent and coherent.

                <h3>§. 2.</h3>
                One considers — B. L. — the passages excerpted from the distinguished I. B. Sylva’s Traité de l’Usage
                des différentes sortes de saignées, principalement de celle du pied (Treatise on the Use of the
                Different Types of Bloodletting, Especially That of the Foot). And from the esteemed Sénac: Essays on
                Physics Regarding the Anatomy of Heister.
                <br>
                <br>In the preface of Cl. Sylva, sections X and XI, the words are as follows:
                <br>
                <br>"The importance of this question, the diversity of opinions dividing physicians, and my desire for
                perfection in my profession have led me to neglect nothing that might help me accurately understand the
                rules to be followed in choosing among the different types of bloodletting, in order to avoid the
                uncertainties and inconsistencies into which most physicians all too often fall on a point so essential
                to medical practice.
                <br>
                <br>In this inquiry, I have followed the principles provided by knowledge of the circulation of the
                blood, the distribution of vessels, and the laws of hydrostatics. (On these matters, I consulted Mr.
                Winslow and skilled geometers.)
                <br>
                <br>It is on these principles that I have determined the revulsion and derivation that each form of
                bloodletting ought to produce, and the specific parts of the body on which they should act."
                <br>
                <br>Another passage from Sylva, Volume II, pages 23-24:
                <br>
                <br>"It was reserved for our century to have the honor of explaining the usefulness of revulsive
                bloodletting. We owe this advantage to the knowledge of the circulation of the blood — an important
                discovery that has allowed us to recognize and condemn Galen’s error,who advised bloodletting at the
                foot for inflammations of the kidneys, bladder, uterus, etc.
                <br>
                <br>With this insight, we can now easily unite reason with experience, and the wisdom of ancient
                medicine with the enlightenment of the modern.
                <br>
                <br>What then is lacking to justify the practice of foot bloodletting in the cases where we recommend
                it?It is clearly established upon the observations of the physicians of antiquity; it is solidly
                demonstrated by the principles of hydrostatics.”
                <br>
                <br>Let us hear the illustrious Senac, p. 514:
                <br>
                <br>"Through all these statements, one has sought to explain what is called revulsion and derivation in
                medical practice. These have become sacred maxims, from which one is no longer permitted to deviate; if
                one does not follow them rigorously, one risks one’s reputation, is accused of ignorance of the laws
                that govern the flow of blood; one is met with reproach from physicians, patients, and the public. These
                inviolable laws have been received by some physicians with the same reverence due to laws most vital to
                human life. But since prejudice does not deserve respect, I will dare to rise against the maxims that
                have been advanced regarding the choice of bloodletting; the ridiculous is joined with prejudice in all
                the refinements of this doctrine. It insults great physicians who have honored their country by their
                profound knowledge and integrity. For if this doctrine is true, then these famous physicians, through
                long years of experience, were unable to discern whether bloodletting at the foot was harmful in
                inflammations of the lower abdomen, and whether it was indispensable in malignant fevers. All these
                great men ignored the harms and benefits that some physicians claim to have perceived generally in
                bloodletting from the foot and the arm. To restore the honor of medicine, which has been insulted, I
                shall present to the public my views on the choice of bloodletting. Those who have defended the opinions
                I have opposed have considered themselves the custodians of the knowledge that forms our art. This
                presumption convinced them that by attacking their ideas, I was attacking all of medicine."
                <br>
                <br>Page 532:
                <br>
                <br>"These are ideas that entirely overturn the doctrine of revulsion and derivation, which forms the
                rule governing bloodletting of the foot and arm. This doctrine had already seemed ridiculous to great
                physicists. A distinguished academician often told me that he had never understood the reasonings of
                physicians on derivation and revulsion, and that all the laws of hydraulics conspired to overturn it.
                The approval he gave my views on bloodletting inspires me with even greater boldness: he told me, in
                confirmation of my opinion, that he was delighted that a physician from the Academy had overthrown the
                foundations of a doctrine that brought shame upon physics."
                <br>
                <i> <br>(1) Book 13 of Methodus Medendi, chapter 11, likewise On the Method of Treatment by Venesection,
                    chapter 18.(2) Galen, whose error was just now being condemned, nevertheless seems to contradict
                    this, as do those whom Senac cites in notes 4, 7, and 8.(3) See note 2.(4) He names Duret, Fernel,
                    Sydenham, and Freind.(†) Let the informed reader observe that Sylvae speaks of Hydrostatics, while
                    Senac speaks of Hydraulics. Which of them is more correct?

                The fair-minded reader will doubtless excuse my desire to present the very lengthy words of these men
                for reading. It is of the utmost importance to me that all my readers can themselves see, weigh, and
                marvel at this immense disagreement. Without doubt, some among my readers will be entirely unfamiliar
                with the matter; many will be without access to the books themselves. I could hardly have hoped to be
                believed, had I only told this story in my own words while merely indicating the relevant pages—except
                perhaps by those who had read the texts themselves. My aim in quoting is to lead the reader into my own
                position, and I believed that one who imagines himself placed in my situation could not judge me
                unfairly—seeing me situated so disadvantageously between the greatest authorities on both sides, unable
                to extricate myself except by allowing them to confront one another, laying aside authority as
                prejudice, and following reason as my guide, though perhaps with an unsteady step. Moreover, these
                passages will be used frequently throughout this writing and will be repeatedly returned to.

                <h3>§. 4.</h3>
                When I first read the words of these men, I recalled the saying from Terence: “You’ve done well – but I
                am now far more uncertain than before.” But realizing that it is not permissible, in good conscience, to
                remain uncertain in a matter of great importance – certainly one that at least one side considers of
                great significance – I resolved first to seek where my own wavering mind might find firm footing. Then,
                through a public writing, I would inform my supporters and those who are judges of my fate of the path I
                think I ought to follow – at least so that it may be clear to them that I am a lover and seeker of
                truth. I will therefore first present the opinions of the ancients regarding venesection as revulsive
                and derivative treatment, then explain those of the moderns, especially the views of Bellini and Sylva –
                the former of whom constructed a certain theory. Then I will set forth my own view, and finally I shall
                speak about practical rules.

                <h3>§. 5.</h3>
                Hippocrates’ statements relevant to this topic are approximately the following (5):
                <br>
                <br>“Venesection should be performed in the following manner: one should take care to make the incision
                as far as possible from the locations where pain tends to arise and where blood accumulates. In this
                way, the change will not be too sudden, and you will shift the tendency so that the blood no longer
                gathers in the same place.”
                <br>
                <br>(6) “In pains of the back and hips, perform venesection at the backs of the knees and the outer
                ankles.”(7) “In pains of the loins and testicles, perform venesection at the backs of the knees and the
                inner ankles.”(8) “In cases of angina, draw blood from the veins in the arms and also purge the bowels
                downward, to remove the cause of the disease.”(9) “In angina, when the tongue is in poor condition, the
                patient suffocates quickly unless help is promptly given by cutting the veins in the arms and under the
                tongue.”(10) “In paracynanche, a vein should be opened especially under the breast (†—the veins under
                the tongue should be opened). Blood should also be drawn from the elbows if strength permits.”(11) “In
                cases of pneumonia and pleurisy—if the pain rises toward the clavicle or the chest—blood should be drawn
                from the inner arm vein on the same side.”(12) In describing a head illness due to low-grade fever
                (lipyria), he says: first let blood from the head, from wherever it seems suitable.(13) “In pain at the
                back of the head, it helps to open the straight vein in the forehead.”
                <br>
                <br>For brevity’s sake, I omit many other passages that seem less relevant to my subject, such as Aph.
                IV, 18, On the Parts of Man, ch. 16 and following, and the entire book On Humors. (14)
                <br>
                <i> <br>(5) In "On the Veins" Book XIII and "On Human Nature" Chapter XXII, there is a kind of
                    angiological discussion, which appears to have been transferred from the former into the latter,
                    since the exact same words are found in Chapters XX, XXI, XXII of the latter and in Chapters XI,
                    XII, XIII of the former. Sylva (II, 7) cites "On the Nature of Bones" instead of "On the Veins", and
                    does not notice that the two Hippocratic quotations he gives are actually the same passage appearing
                    in two places – a likely sign he did not consult the texts himself. Had he done so, he ought not to
                    have omitted the nearby statements unfavorable to his position (see notes 6 and 7).

                    judgment (i.e., the decisive point in disease), there was no longer opportunity for the bloodletting

                <h3>§. 6.</h3>
                Celsus (15), in his most elegant chapter on bloodletting via the veins, says the following:
                <br>
                <br>“Blood should be drawn from the arm if the cause concerns the whole body; but if it pertains to a
                specific part, then from that very part or at least the one nearest to it, since blood cannot be drawn
                from just anywhere — only at the temples, arms, or near the ankles.Nor am I unaware that some say blood
                should be drawn as far away as possible from the place where harm occurs, so that the flow of material
                is diverted. But by that method, it is actually drawn to the very part that is already burdened.But this
                too is false (16). For the nearest area is exhausted first, and blood from more distant parts follows
                only to the extent that it is drawn; once the drawing stops, since it is no longer being pulled, it
                doesn’t come at all.”
                <br>
                <i><br>(15) Cl. Sylva, in Book II, chapter 10, preparing to respond to Celsus Hecquet—against whom he
                    was disputing the legitimacy of bloodletting in the foot for smallpox, etc.—admits that this passage
                    from Celsus is not favorable to his argument. However, he considers it a suitable occasion to vent
                    his animosity toward Celsus.He cites Volume II, page 19, listing numerous unfair judgments made
                    against Celsus, including one from Salmasius (Saumaise went even further; for he called him
                    completely ignorant in medicine, in Prolegomena homonym. hyl. Iatricae).He notes that Lindenius
                    believed Celsus was referencing that Hippocratic passage in De Natura Humana and De Venis, and so
                    offers Hecquet a choice between the authority of Celsus or Hippocrates.He suggests Celsus may have
                    relied on a work of doubtful authority, and a plausible argument to support this doubt is the fact
                    that Celsus does not name Hippocrates in this instance—despite frequently mentioning him elsewhere
                    with great reverence, e.g., in Book VIII, chapter 4.
                    <br>
                    <br>(16) This reasoning is similar to that used by Cl. Quesnay in his Observations on the Effects of
                    Bloodletting, Proposition III:"The amount that flows more into the arm (from a channel that splits
                    in two), where there is derivation, than into the one where there is revulsion, will always equal
                    the amount that has been removed."

                bloodletting. Yet that very superstition astonishingly survived for many centuries after Aretaeus.So,
                let me now present at a glance how and in which diseases Aretaeus performed bloodletting.From the elbow,
                he drew blood in cases of: apoplexy, phrenitis (inflammation of the mind/brain), cephalalgia (headache),
                and vertigo; angina, cionitis (inflammation of the breast?), pleuritis, peripneumonia, hepatitis, ileus
                (intestinal obstruction), and inflammation of the kidneys.From the ankle, he bled in cases of:
                suffocation of the womb, satyriasis, and kidney stones.(22) For bloodletting from other sites, see note
                18.
                <br>
                <br>(17) De Curatione Acutorum Morborum (Book II, Chapter 2). Aretaeus is here perceptive and prudent:
                although he knew the opinion was false, he nevertheless gave way to it, since it mattered little to him:
                <br>
                <br>“But if, he says, blood is carried to the spleen, then open the vein of the left hand that lies
                between the little finger and the ring finger, since some physicians believe it is connected all the way
                to the spleen.”
                <br>
                <br>That whole passage about bloodletting, which occurs frequently in Aretaeus, is magnificent, so I
                cannot refrain from excerpting also the following:
                <br>
                <br>"Most certainly, blood must be restrained before the patient collapses, and not too much must be
                removed; for even bleeding from the mouth alone can sufficiently weaken a person. But after removing a
                little blood, you must draw blood again persistently, both on the same day, the next, and even the day
                after that. However, if the patient is thin and bloodless, then do not open a vein."
                <br>
                <br>This chapter deals with blood evacuation and rejection.Aretaeus was, for his time, like Botallo.See
                De Cur. Acut. II.1, II.5, II.7, II.11, and De Cur. Diut. II.13.
                <br>
                <i> <br>(18) In the case of cephalalgia (headache) and vertigo, Aretaeus also used threefold methods of
                    bloodletting:
                    By section of the straight frontal vein (recommended also for epilepsy; cf. note 13),
                    By arteriotomy of the temporal or post-auricular arteries,
                    And another type of arteriotomy through the nose (imitating nasal hemorrhage).

                    "Open the vein that lies beneath the elbow, in the hollow (of the arm), especially in cases where
                    side
                    pain (pleurisy) occurs, for it is better to draw blood from farther away."
                    <br>
                    <br> (20)
                    "If the vein at the ankle does not flow well, then target the one at the elbow."
                    <br>
                    <br>(21)
                    "You should open a vein at both the elbow and the ankle, and you must draw blood frequently and in
                    great
                    quantity."

                <h3>§. 8.</h3>
                Among Galen’s many passages where the concepts of revulsion and derivation are described with nearly
                identical words, I select this one:
                <br>(23) "Thus, and for all other flows, since the general principle is the same, you shall either
                divert (revulsion) or conduct (derivation) them: (24) those that occur through the bowels shall be
                diverted through urine or the womb; those that pass through urine shall be diverted through the bowels
                or the rectum; similarly, what flows through the womb may be led off through the bowels or urine; and
                flows in the eyes, ears, or palate should be diverted through the nose.Revulsion is always carried
                downward for what is above, and upward for what is below; likewise, from the right side to the left and
                vice versa; and from internal parts to external ones and conversely."
                <br>(25) "The revulsion of confluent humors was called antispasis by Hippocrates, whereas the diversion
                of humors already occupying a part is derivation.Both types of evacuation usually occur through the
                common veins.For instance:To draw humors from the uterus, you open a vein at the elbow (revulsion); to
                derive them, you open veins at the popliteal fossa or the ankles.If the right side of the uterus is
                afflicted, blood should be drawn from the right hand and leg; if the left, then from the opposite
                limbs." (26)
                <br>(27) "Not only reason but also experience indicates that different types of evacuation better suit
                different parts:
                <br>When inflammation begins in the mouth, it should be diverted to the nose;
                <br>the humeral vein should be incised in the hand, or the middle vein if it is not visible;
                <br>if the liver, chest, lung, or heart is affected, the internal vein should be incised;
                <br>in cases of angina, first the veins of the hands, then those under the tongue;
                <br>for affections of the occiput, open the elbow vein or the frontal vein;
                <br>for diseases of the kidneys, bladder, genitals, and uterus, the veins in the legs, especially around
                the knees, or if not, those near the ankles.”

                    19 and 22.It is remarkable to see the debates that have arisen over the word „καθ᾽ ἰξιν“.Elsewhere
                    Galen says (On Treatment by Bloodletting 15):"That ‚καθ᾽ ἰξιν‘ means the same as ‚καθ᾽ εὐθὺ‘ is
                    agreed upon by all."

                    dissuade anyone who denies the effects of derivation and revulsion, at the appropriate point.
                    <br>In the meantime, I note – which B.L. will easily see – that although the first words may seem to
                    support the proponents of derivation and revulsion, all of their arguments are actually
                    overturned.See note 2 and compare with On Treatment by Bloodletting, chapter 18:
                    <br> "The kidneys, he says, sometimes respond to bloodletting from the elbow – especially if there
                    was recent inflammation and an excess of blood.But in actual nephritis, it is better to open the
                    vein in the popliteal region, or at least those in the ankles.Moreover, inflammations of the uterus
                    are more helped by incisions in the leg veins than those of the kidneys."

                <h3>§. 9.</h3>
                To fully explain the entire ancient theory of revulsion and derivation — if it can even be called a
                theory, given their ignorance of the blood circulation — would be not only a difficult task at this
                point, but indeed an extremely arduous one,(28) if someone wished to compile everything, just as Renatus
                Moreau compiled the opinions of all physicians up to his time regarding bloodletting in pleurisy, and
                now sought to do the same for the entire doctrine of revulsion and derivation up to our own time.
                <br>
                <br>The ancients (29) imagined (30) that vessels ran through the human body in much the same way as we
                today believe nerve fibers — indeed whole fascicles — extend in a continuous line from their origin to
                the part where they function.
                <br>
                <br>And just as the animal spirits were thought to flow straight from the spinal cord into such a
                bundle, separating from others and finally reaching the little finger of the left hand, so it was
                believed that the Salvatella vein infused purified blood from the spleen into the little finger.
                <br>
                <br>When imbued with such ideas and following the axiom "opposites are cured by opposites," it was easy
                to deduce all the modes of revulsion and derivation, which Galen so beautifully and systematically lays
                out, along with all possible variations, at the places cited in note 23.
                <br>
                <br>Thus it follows that the vein on the same side (καθ' ίξιν) as the afflicted part should be opened —
                for example (31) in inflammations of the liver, the internal vein in the right elbow.
                <br>
                <br>However, my aim is not to show what the ancient opinions were, but in what diseases they used
                bloodletting.
                <br>
                <i> <br>(28)Already Galen, in De Cur. per V. S. chapter 15, states:"Whatever has been said by physicians
                    about this scheme, if I were to attempt to write it down, it would require a book devoted entirely
                    to
                    it."
                    <br>Nevertheless, one may hope for even greater praise for whoever would undertake this task, given
                    the
                    greater difficulty and dignity associated with the general question of the locations for
                    bloodletting,
                    compared to the more specific matter of bloodletting in pleurisy.Moreau himself declares that he had
                    already set himself this goal.

                    II, Chapter 5:
                    <br>"For mathematicians, opposites are those which hold to the center of the same line — but for
                    physicians, opposites are those which, in the straight course of the same vein through which the
                    humors
                    flow, are as far apart as possible.
                    <br>When a vein is opened, the part closest to the wound is emptied first; afterwards, blood is
                    drawn
                    from more distant parts, and this is completed through the action of the straight fibers (for nature
                    intended them to draw blood, while the transverse fibers are meant to repel it).
                    <br>Thus more blood, and more quickly, is drawn from those parts toward which the fibers are
                    directed
                    than from the others."

                <h3>§. 10.</h3>
                I pass over the authors (32) who lived from Galen to Harvey, being content with having briefly touched
                on the disputes of the 16th-century authors regarding bloodletting in pleurisy. (33)The Arabs and the
                so-called barbarians – the Latin physicians of the Middle Ages – followed, as is clear to anyone reading
                the passages cited by Moraeus, that canon of Galen (34): namely, that in cases of the confluence of
                humors revulsion should be performed, and in cases of obstruction of a part derivation should be used.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, the Arab opinion prevailed from the year 712 to 1514, almost without any protest, that blood
                should be drawn from the opposite arm, or from the saphenous vein of the same side.
                <br>
                <br>At last, there arose an opponent: Petrus Brissotus, around the year 1514, who taught that the Arabs
                contradicted Galen, because Galen demanded bloodletting from the arm of the affected side.
                <br>
                <br>Ultimately, he persuaded his contemporaries, who swore by Galen's words brought forth from
                obscurity, and prevailed more by the authority of Galen than by the weight of his arguments.
                <br>
                <br>There were fierce disputes, with mutual accusations of countless deaths, and Martin Akakia (35),
                Brissot’s disciple, seems to me to have been a most shameless man.
                <br>
                <br>As physicians across the world divided into factions and parties, Nicolaus Monardus and Hieronymus
                Mercurialis thought of forging a treaty (36) between the Greeks and the Arabs; finally, there was
                Leonardus Botallus (37), who said that it mattered more how much blood you drew than from where.
                <br>
                <br>It is a most tedious thing to read the disputes of these men about revulsion and derivation (38),
                who fought like andabatae (blindfolded gladiators), writing as they did before Harvey; though the
                geometrical demonstrations of Brissot, Fernel, and, on the opposing side, Julius Caesar Scaliger (39),
                are very entertaining.

                <i> <br>
                    <br> (32) Caelius Aurelianus, like Aretaeus (both are said to have followed Archigenes), wished
                    bloodletting to be performed at the elbow of the opposite side.Oribasius, Aëtius, Alexander, Paulus,
                    and Actuarius agree with Galen’s rule, see note 25.

                    <br> (35) Moreau, p. 36.It seems, however, that it harmed the Arabs to bleed too sparingly, making
                    them less successful in healing, and so they were accused of behaving like Akakia because they
                    performed bloodletting from the opposite side.
                    <br>
                    <br> (36) These are Moreau’s words (p. 56), but it seems to me that Galen himself must be reconciled
                    with himself:for the Arabs relied on Galen’s rule (note 25), while Brissotus and the others based
                    their practice on bleeding from the affected side.In favor of the Arabs stands Aretaeus, whose
                    authority, if one must fight by authority, easily equals that of Galen, as does Caelius Aurelianus'.

                The most illustrious torch lit by Harvey for all of medicine should also have let its bright rays
                penetrate into that obscure corner of medical doctrine about revulsion and derivation,although an
                excessive reverence for antiquity – which, like contempt for it, must have its limits and proper measure
                – prevented all the mists from being fully dispersed.Thus, among the arguments brought forward by those
                who could not bear the new light against Harvey (for what else could they offer but the authority of the
                ancients?) was also this one (40):
                <br>
                <br>"By Harvey, the entire basis for revulsion and derivation is abolished; the straightness and
                connectedness of the vessels is abolished, since in bloodletting the blood is not drawn away from the
                affected part, but rather from the heart, whence it passes into the arteries (41)."
                <br>
                <br>The defenders of the new truth answered in this way: that if they had not already been burdened by
                the weight of authority, as happens to reformers,they would not have tolerated the names "revulsion" and
                "derivation" any longer,and that the next step toward new truth would already have been taken, if it had
                been possible to follow it more freely, despite the clamor of the crowd.Thus, the only fruit gathered
                from this most fertile soil, regarding bloodletting, was this:that – as Aretaeus had already seen (42)
                and as the restorers of anatomy before Harvey had already pointed out (43) –it could finally be openly
                recognized that the superstition in the choice of veins in the arm or foot (44) was laughable.
                <br>
                <i> <br>(40) These words come from Jacques Primerose in his Exercitationes et animadversiones against
                    Harvey’s work on the circulation of blood (De motu cordis, London 1630, p. 87), a pamphlet he
                    proudly called a “fourteen-day fetus” in his critique of Regius and Walaeus.He also boasts that he –
                    if he wished – could defend Harvey’s theory in some way.You can also hear the lamenting V.F.
                    Plempius, who later had to recant (palinodia) in his large work De subtilitate, Vol. II, p. 516. See
                    his objection No. 44:
                    <br>"How can blood drained from the cephalica vein in the arm help in ophthalmia, when the eye blink
                    and the spirits rush there in haste?"
                    <br>And No. 45:"In pleuritis – if blood constantly passes through the affected part – how does
                    venesection help? How is the progression of the disease slowed? How should digestion, maturation,
                    and resolution take place? God bless!"
                    <br>And No. 46:"In angina: how does blood drawn from the cephalica vein in the arm help?"
                    <br>And No. 48:"And how, when it is about preventing inflammation, drawing off humors, soothing and
                    calming pain – can bloodletting, which Galen considered an immediate remedy, along with friction and
                    bandages, be useless?Everything seems futile, the medical art deceptive, and yet it works – as
                    autopsies and centuries of experience prove – because nature works on its own, and the doctor, its
                    guide, thus gets resistance from the very system."
                    <br>
                    <br>(41) See how the great Harvey responds to his opponents in Exerc. III, surely with the 56
                    objections of Plempius in mind:
                    <br>"Those who oppose circulation do so because they cannot solve medical problems without the
                    existing circulation;or because they consider it unworthy to abandon previously accepted opinions;
                    and deem it sacrilege to question the old tradition and authority.To all this, I answer: nature and
                    truth do not concern themselves with age.They raise medical objections that they think are
                    unsolvable.But even with the circulation in progress, bloodletting is done, even though the blood is
                    driven to the affected part.But about all this and many other things, one should not discuss the
                    consequences until the circulation is recognized as truth."
                    <br>See also in Exerc. II, how Harvey rebukes Riolanus for wavering between authority and the new
                    truth.
                    <br>As for Primerose, see how Roger Drake responds to him in Vindiciae contra Primerosium, in
                    Doctores virorum disceptationes de circulatione sanguinis, Leiden 1656, p. 235,and Highmore in
                    Disquisitio anatomica corporis humani, p. 149–150.They nearly return to a universal revulsion, which
                    they describe as a result of evacuation.Highmore says: "With the circulation in place and the
                    principle of revulsion upheld, blood can still be drained from the source – and thus from the
                    affected part."
                    <br>
                    <br>(42) See § 7.

                    <br>(43) Vesalius, De corporis humani fabrica, Book VIII, Chapter 8; Fallopius, p. 504.(†) Unless
                    medical reasons suggest otherwise.
                    <br>
                    <br>(44) Everywhere, the question is raised: how could such great discoveries not have provided
                    greater benefit in medical practice?For instance, raised by Ramazzini in his description of the year
                    1691 (see below).See also Primerose’s pressing preface to his Animadversiones contra
                    Walaeum:"Harvey, he says, had conceived something ingenious and praiseworthy about the circulation
                    of blood – but for the medical art he practiced, it was entirely useless."You can also hear, if you
                    like, in the underworld, Erasistratus boasting of healing Seleukos’ stepmother (though this is more
                    a sign of political than medical wit)and Harvey in Fontenelle’s dialogues.

                I frequently find complaints from authors about those who, with the selection of veins in the same
                region, completely cut off all parts whose vessels were to be dissected, while still making a choice.
                Those who have dared to speak out in public writings about this matter are few, and in our time, hardly
                more than these: (45) Bernhard Ramazzini, (46) Johann Bohnius, Ill. G. E. (47) Hamberger, Ill., (48)
                Senac, Clmos I. C. Kuchler, (49) and Christian Ferdinand Zweigel; and although there may be others
                unknown to me, it is undeniable that the selection of these names provides no measure compared to the
                vast number of other authors, among whom so many illustrious names are to be found, each of which would
                certainly eliminate any doubt if we were to discuss not so much the weight of the arguments but rather
                the number of supporters and authorities. All these authors agree that the most important factor for
                healing lies in the choice of the site where blood is to be let.
                <br>
                <i> <br>(45) Those who criticize both revulsion and derivation and completely reject all bloodletting,
                    such as Helmont, F. S. Bontekoe, and others, are not counted. However, Bernhard Ramazzini himself,
                    as it seems, was too hemophobic, rejecting revulsion and derivation in the Constituția Epidemica of
                    1691, written to G. G. Leibniz, and inserted in Eph. Germ. December 11. A. X., as well as in Opera
                    Sydenhami, Geneva 1726:
                    <br>"Revulsion via the veins has now been decided – certain minds are deeply influenced by this idea
                    of the power of revulsion through veins, but in reality, it only serves to reduce the fullness of
                    the blood. It is excusable for Aem. Parisano and Primirofio, who, as L. di Capua says, did this not
                    for other reasons, but because they saw that revulsion through veins had been such a well-known
                    remedy for centuries, almost completely collapsing."

                But all unanimously affirm that Laurentii Bellini, although not particularly favorable, (50) also with
                greater confidence and certainty, because a man who says nothing (51) except what he demonstrates, has
                brought the doctrine of revulsion and derivation to a comprehension of geometric truths. I have reviewed
                many volumes and sought information on this subject and have observed that it has been examined by a few
                individuals who have worked deliberately on it. The discussion of this subject has especially occurred
                in recent times in France, by distinguished and renowned men: 1. B. Sylva, in his book Traité de l'usage
                des différentes sortes des saignées principalement de celle du Pied, two volumes, 1727, by Fr. Quesnay,
                (52) who published observations on the effects of bloodletting, with critical remarks on Sylva's
                treatise, 1730; D. Chevalier, (53) who wrote Réflexions critiques sur le traité des différentes sortes
                des saignées, and others, 1730; D. Martin, (54) who published a treatise on phlebotomy and arteriotomy,
                and others, 1741; Hecqueto, (55) who wrote observations on bloodletting from the foot; Meurisseos a
                Morisson; (56) finally, R. Buttler, who wrote An Essay concerning Blood-letting. London, 1734. (57)

                <br>
                <i> <br>(50) Bellini, on bloodletting, in his practical works published by Bohnio. 3rd edition, 1718.
                    <br>
                    <br>(51) Senac, p. 511: "Bellini was the first to attempt to give a 'theory that decides the course
                    of
                    blood during bloodletting – he was driven by the prejudices that prevailed among physicians, even
                    misusing geometry and physics to support his errors: but even when going astray, he always acted as
                    a
                    great man." The abuse of the term demonstration is unfortunately very common. Who, please, would
                    believe
                    Bellini, what he claims in his Dissertation de S. M. Prop. III? "From the sole M. S. and at the time
                    it
                    is celebrated, the total quantity left in the vessels can be moved, rarefied, heated, fermented in
                    marvelous ways, so that whatever is diseased, and whatever is remarkable and unexpected, immediately
                    appears in the body." Who would not be outraged by these words, which recur throughout the entire
                    dispute, and which clearly have no meaning? Who would be moved by the reasoning given by the
                    delusion of
                    mind in V. S. Prop. IV?
                    <br>
                    <br>(52) He leaves only the derivation, asserting that revulsion is not different from evacuation,
                    positioning himself between the cited notes 45 and 49 and the others. He contradicts Sylva in that
                    he
                    does not seem to completely condemn derivation. Moreover, like the others, he errs in considering
                    the
                    descending and ascending aorta as completely separate channels and asserts that derivation occurs
                    not
                    only in the artery that gives blood to the severed vein but also in all its upper branches. For
                    example,
                    a familiar channel split into two branches could have led him to the truth, if he had applied it not
                    to
                    the aorta’s branches in curvature but to the very artery that provides blood to the severed vein and
                    to
                    the arteries that stem from the same point.
                    <br>
                    <br>(53) His entire argument is to deny Sylva’s three propositions: 1) V. S. in the arm is
                    derivatory in
                    relation to the head; 2) V. S. in the foot is not derivatory in relation to the lungs; 3) V. S. in
                    the
                    foot revulses from the upper parts, while V. S. in the arm revulses from the lower parts. This is
                    the
                    common error made by all regarding the ascending and descending aorta, and derivation not only in
                    the
                    artery giving blood to the severed vein, but also in all its upper branches, going all the way to
                    the
                    heart. See this throughout the book and in the actual explanation of the table from Verheyeno, p.
                    473,
                    348, 77, etc. When considering the entire work, it is clear that the author does not explain his own
                    opinion clearly unless it is obscurely explained, p. 348 ff., and I have noted that his books often
                    contain frequent contradictions.
                    <br>
                    <br>(54) He points out several things against Sylva, Quesnay, and Senac. Against Sylva, he strongly
                    and
                    nobly points out that it is futile to agree when he denies that the section in the arm and jugular
                    is
                    derivatory in relation to the head, fearing that it would contradict it. He admits, however, that S.
                    M.
                    in the arm revulses laterally from the head, while acknowledging that the section in the jugular is
                    derivatory in relation to the head, but claims that it would be a moderate derivation that would be
                    useful if the jugular section is done after several revulsion sections, p. 258. But this contradicts
                    what he writes on page 105, where he debates against Quesnay on the harmful effects of derivation.
                    He
                    argues that a moderate derivation would be less harmful but never as useful as Freindius claims in
                    his
                    jugular section, which holds great authority with Martin, who even wants Freindius to be used at the
                    outset. He also points out contradictions between pages 21 and 123; on page 21, he defends lateral
                    derivation in the branches above the artery that gives blood, due to reduced resistance in that
                    artery,
                    while on page 123 it is stated that derivation occurs in those lateral branches because of the
                    blocked
                    vein, i.e., the original resistance is restored.
                    <br>He is the first to mention on page 100 ff. the retrograde effect (contrecoup) after a blocked
                    vein;
                    but neither he nor the others considered that, however much one might believe in the great effects
                    of
                    revulsion and derivation, they could be nullified by this retrograde effect.

                <h3>§. 14.</h3>
                I have said that commonly everyone refers to Bellinus, but still does not support his accepted opinion
                much. See Bellini's Theory:
                <br>
                <br>Proposition I, 1:
                <br>
                <br>"From whichever vein the blood is sent, the amount of blood flowing into the main artery trunk,
                whose branch is continuous with the vein from which the blood is sent, has a greater proportion compared
                to the amount flowing into another trunk at the same time, than the amounts that flow at the same time
                into the same trunks when no blood is being sent, but all is flowing through its channels."
                <br>
                <br>This proof is as follows: The blood flowing through the arteries pushes the blood flowing through
                the veins, and the blood in the veins hinders the blood flowing through those same veins; therefore, by
                removing this obstruction, which occurs in each venous outlet, the resistance is diminished not only for
                the blood flowing through the arteries connected to the veins, but also through their larger branches,
                and finally the trunk to the heart.
                <br>
                <br>"The amount flowing into the artery of the part, from which the blood is sent through the vein, has
                a greater proportion compared to the amount flowing into the artery of the opposite part, coming from
                the same origin, than the amounts flowing when no blood is being sent."
                <br>
                <br>For example, when blood is sent from the saphena of the right leg, the amount that flows into the
                right iliac is greater than the one that flows into the left.
                <br>
                <br>"In the ratio of the quantities flowing from one trunk into its branches through V. S., nothing
                changes."
                <br>
                <br>For example, from the affected saphena, less blood flows into both axillary arteries than before V.
                S., but it is evenly distributed as before.
                <br>
                <br>"The speed of blood in all veins, which extend from the outlet to the heart's auricle, and in the
                arteries, will be greater unless it is possible that the blood contained in the entire venous tract,
                which is between the right auricle of the heart and the outlet, and the subsequent blood in the veins
                leading into that tract, as well as the blood in the arteries from which the veins receive, will flow at
                a lower speed than when no blood is being sent."
                <br>
                <br>The main trunk of the inferior vena cava near the heart will appear to open more into the other and
                will, if possible, move its own blood into the other, but the trunk, from which any vein sends blood,
                will derive less blood to the auricle than the other. Thus, some blood may flow from the trunk, whose
                vein sends no blood, and its velocity in the other will increase.
                <br>
                <br>"The increased velocity, which is exercised through the vein from which the blood is sent, and all
                the channels converging in these, has, as through the artery, a greater proportion of velocity in the
                same channels before V. S., than the increased velocity through any other homologous channels, compared
                to the velocity in the same when no blood is sent."
                <br>
                <br>"Shortly after the cessation of blood, this inequality of velocities ceases, and only the increased
                velocity remains, which is indeed greater in velocity before V. S., but in all vessels with the same
                ratios that were present before V. S."
                <br>
                <br>"However, it is necessary that the amount of blood sent does not reduce the effectiveness of the
                heart's contractions, the muscles, and the membranes that constitute the walls."
                <br>
                <br>Proposition VI, p. 106: "The terms revulsion and derivation are not as empty as some suppose; this
                is clear from these propositions, that blood can be derived from a vein to a larger part of the body
                within a given time than if it were sent from another. Furthermore, when a specific part is affected, it
                is safest to send blood from the trunk, whose branches do not lead to the affected part; then from the
                veins of the opposite side coming from the same trunk, and finally from the affected part itself; and
                this happens for no other reason than that, if blood were immediately sent from the affected part, there
                would be a danger that the disease would be aggravated by the mere influx of a greater quantity of
                material to the affected part. This is the bad effect attributed to derivation when it is administered
                too prematurely; for it is through M. S. that from the other trunk, a larger quantity of blood may flow
                into the affected part than into the other, whose branches supply the inflamed part, and thus a smaller
                amount will be directed to this area, and this is the very effect attributed to revulsion. First,
                revulsion, then derivation must be administered."
                <br>
                <i> <br>(58) "I have already pointed out this erroneous division of the aorta, and I will continue to do
                    so. However, there is some truth in this proposition, provided the argumentation is not reversed,
                    for when more blood flows into the trunk, it is also said that in all its branches, from the heart
                    to the arteries, where the severed vein has blood, more blood will flow than before M. S. This is
                    the foundation for the Sylvian and the common theory, which Bellini does not mention, and which I
                    consider to be false. I said there is something true in this Bellinian proposition: it is not much;
                    for I will show that the revulsion from the severed vein in the foot is infinitely small in the
                    arteries of the head and upper extremities."
                    <br>
                    <br>(59) "This argument is used by all to demonstrate revulsion."
                    <br>
                    <br>(60) "Not only is there a greater proportion of the quantity of blood flowing into the artery
                    from which the severed vein has blood than there was before S. M., but also an absolutely smaller
                    amount will flow into the artery from the same point, during V. S., than it did before; I will show
                    this in its proper place, if it is indeed true, as all assert, that derivation occurs through V. S.
                    in the artery that provides blood to the severed vein, which I do not believe."
                    <br>
                    <br>(61) "This is Bellini's private commentary, certainly false! For neither the continuous channels
                    are the inferior and superior vena cava, nor does this mutual resistance allow for the Eustachian
                    valve."
                    <br>
                    <br>(62) "When this inequality of velocities ceases, and the original ratios return, it is only
                    right that all effects of this inequality not only cease, but are completely destroyed; there is
                    nothing to hope for or fear from revulsion and derivation. For if the severed vein accelerates the
                    blood in the artery supplying blood to the severed vein, the closed vein is delayed. The effects of
                    this acceleration and delay cancel each other out and disappear, except for the effect of
                    evacuation."
                    <br>
                    <br>(63) "But why not immediately from these veins on the opposite side from the same trunk, if the
                    goal is revulsion? For this revulsion is much greater than the one that occurs in the completely
                    opposite trunk."

                <h3>§. 15.</h3>
                Cl. Sylvae System:
                <br>
                <br>"Every V. S. is simultaneously evacuatory, derivational, and revulsive.The cause of the derivation
                is the unchanged resistance that opposed the blood flowing in the severed vein.The derivation begins in
                the first moment of M. S., grows while it lasts, diminishes shortly after it ends, and finally is
                removed.The derivation is greater in the artery corresponding to the severed vein than in any other.In
                those branches that depart from the trunk, from the place where V. S. occurs, all the way to the heart,
                the derivation varies according to the distance from the heart; the closer the location is to the heart,
                the smaller the derivation there."Here (Rhodes) is the leap.Therefore, the relevant explanations on this
                matter should be presented in more detail."Obstruction, he says, in V. S. in the foot ceases, because
                the arterial channel from the heart to the place where S. is inserted abundantly derivates blood; a part
                of this blood, which flows rapidly into the trunk, enters the laterally branching arteries: here, a
                stronger blood pressure dilates the valve and creates a path for the menstrual blood intended by
                nature.A difficulty (that opposes the explanation of this V. S. effect) arises, but it can easily be
                removed. This difficulty is: It seems that the blood, which is drawn into the arterial channel going
                directly from the heart to the foot, should flow out entirely through the opening of the pricked vein
                and flow out just as quickly as it entered; and thus, however real the derivation is in the direct
                channel, the uterine arteries, which branch laterally, should not be affected."
                <br>
                <br>It is not certain that the amount of blood emitted through V. S. is equal to the amount in the
                derived trunk. This is certainly not true without derivation; for when the impulse of the derivation is
                at its maximum, it seems insufficient for the hole in the vein to emit all the blood that has been
                pushed into the lower aortic trunk, so that a part of the blood must necessarily be directed into the
                lateral arteries.
                <br>
                <br>Even if all of this is conceded, it is sufficient that the speed of blood in the channel that runs
                directly from the heart to the point of V. S. is increased. However, this speed cannot increase in the
                trunk without also increasing in the branches.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, it is at least certain that the derivation occurs in the lateral branches at the end of V.
                S., after the vein is closed. The blood, which rapidly descends, is deflected sideways, and with one
                powerful impulse, it expands the branches, resulting in a sudden filling and expansion of the uterine
                arteries’ outer portions, which is the effect commonly seen in the foot during V. S., where the
                menstrual flow is restored.
                <br>
                <br>When more blood is derived through V. S. into the arterial channel corresponding to the severed
                vein, an equal amount of blood must be diverted from the remaining arteries. Revulsion occurs in all
                parts of the body except at the point of V. S., but it varies depending on the location of the arteries
                and their connection to the artery corresponding to the severed vein. Near the heart, where the aorta
                divides into the ascending and descending trunks, the revulsion is equal to the derivation in the
                opposite trunk. In the arteries that branch off from either trunk below the division of the aorta, the
                situation is different. When more blood is derived via V. S. into these branches, the revulsion will be
                inversely proportional to the derivation, and the further the branch is from the heart, the smaller the
                revulsion will be.
                <br>
                <br>One revulsion is constant and absolute, the other is variable. I hope, with permission from B. L.,
                that at first glance it will be understood how remarkable this comment is, even though we can omit the
                lengthy review of the numerous points covered on pages 29-38 about this revulsion, both the absolute and
                the variable, and instead briefly explain what is said about the use of the various V. S.
                <br>
                <br>Derivation has few beneficial effects, and fear is a very justified cause. A prudent doctor should
                never derive where there is an obstruction. The only benefit of derivation is that it removes menstrual
                obstructions.
                <br>
                <br>The greatest benefit of revulsion is to remove the obstruction where it exists, particularly at the
                onset of the issue. However, it is clear that praise should only be given to absolute revulsion, not to
                variable revulsion, which is always ambiguous and often harmful.
                <br>
                <br>V. S. should be done on the arm in cases of inflammation of the lower extremities or abdominal
                organs, in true pleuritis (from the fifth to the last rib), in uterine hemorrhage, in excessive
                hemorrhoidal bleeding, in erysipelas, or other inflammations of the opposite arm. It should not be
                performed in cases of inflammation of the mediastinum, pericardium, sternum due to the medial artery and
                internal mammary, in pleuritis of the upper four ribs, in neck inflammation due to branches of the
                vertebral artery, in obstructions or inflammation of the brain, or in inflammation of the same arm where
                V. S. is performed.
                <br>
                <br>V. S. on the foot is useful for restoring menstruation if there is no suspicion of uterine
                inflammation, and is particularly effective in preventing brain overload. It is harmful in obstructions
                and inflammations of the lower extremities, all abdominal organs, and hemorrhages in these areas
                (uterine, hemorrhoidal, etc.).
                <br>
                <br>Due to the variable revulsion, it might be useful in diseases of the opposite foot, but this useful
                effect of variable revulsion has already been condemned.
                <br>
                <br>The jugular section, because it derives blood into the carotid trunks, derives into both the
                external and internal carotids, even though it detracts from the lower aorta and subclavians. Therefore,
                its usefulness may be limited to diseases of the lower trunk up to the fourth rib, but regarding the
                head, it does not deserve much praise and can be harmful in brain diseases, as it causes a blood flow
                that could worsen the condition, especially at the beginning.

                <br>
                <i> <br>(65) T. 1, p. 2, 13-16, 22, 25-28, 29, 46, 64, 113.
                    <br>
                    <br>(66) It is an argument used by Bellinus and all others.
                    <br>
                    <br>(67) Indeed, not only is the effect diminished, but it is also completely destroyed by the
                    occlusion of the cut vein, whose cause is the section of the vein. Just as a man who might have
                    chosen a military route may have moved a lot, but did not advance anything.
                    <br>
                    <br>(68) Certainly; no derivation occurs in any other artery except the one that receives blood from
                    the cut vein.
                    <br>
                    <br>(69) I ask B. L. to consider this before demonstrating the opposite: nothing changes in the
                    blood’s driving forces from the heart and arteries while V. S. is ongoing; indeed, nothing changes
                    in the resistances opposing the blood in the branching arteries, except in the one artery
                    corresponding to the cut vein: we should argue as follows, because through a small resistance in the
                    artery (e.g., the right femoral artery), more blood flows than before, while in the internal iliac
                    artery, nothing has changed; it cannot receive more blood than it did before (though something can
                    be withdrawn, but we can ignore that here); however, the common right iliac artery takes in so much
                    more blood, as it receives from the right femoral artery, than the left iliac artery does;
                    furthermore, the inferior mesenteric artery only takes as much blood as it did before, while the
                    aortic trunk will take much more blood than usual, depending on how much the right iliac artery
                    takes, and so it continues all the way to the heart, even if we temporarily allow the division into
                    the ascending and descending aorta trunks. This will cause the descending aorta to take more blood
                    than usual, depending on how much the right femoral artery takes.
                    <br>
                    <br>(70) I cannot say that his insight was great, since he found it easy to understand; but I cannot
                    avoid saying that he considered it an easy answer.
                    <br>
                    <br>(71) I preferred to quote Sylva's words, lest I be accused of distorting the meaning, which
                    seems quite obscure to me unless his words, if I am not mistaken, were not precise enough.
                    <br>
                    <br>(72) Thus it seems to me, for not only is no blood derived, but it is also drawn back from the
                    uterine arteries.
                    <br>
                    <br>(73) Indeed, this is certainly true, if it is certain that the effects are equal to their
                    causes. More blood is derived into the aortic trunk than usual, because the femoral artery takes in
                    more.
                    <br>
                    <br>(†) I respond in the words of Celsus: Blood follows only as far as it is emitted: where it is
                    suppressed, because it is not drawn, it does not even come.
                    <br>
                    <br>(74) If the cause of the greater velocity in the trunk is that the heart's driving force is
                    greater, the velocity would also increase in all branches, but since the cause of this increase is
                    only in the branch or trunk corresponding to the severed vein, there is no need for an increase in
                    the superior branches.
                    <br>
                    <br>(75) This argument is truly remarkable, for it assigns the same effect to opposing causes. If
                    the blood continues to descend rapidly after the vein is closed, what would be the cause of the
                    rapidity if the vein is open? It is true that the closed vein reflects blood into the nearest
                    lateral arteries; however, it is impossible for the opposite to be true, and for derivation to take
                    place in an open vein.
                    <br>
                    <br>(76) Correct: something is diverted from all arteries, a revulsion occurs, but there is no
                    derivation except in the artery that corresponds to the severed vein. And the revulsion, contrary to
                    what Sylva thinks, is smaller the closer it is to the heart, but the closer the location is to the
                    V.S. location, the greater the revulsion.
                    <br>
                    <br>(77) Here, B. L. sees the error arising from the erroneous division of the aorta into two
                    completely different channels, and the division of the body into two almost separate regions. Had
                    Sylva and the others considered that the angle they form has nothing to do with this question, and
                    that they could not have understood that, with V.S. in the foot, revulsion must also occur in the
                    axillary and carotid arteries, they would have understood that revulsion must also occur first in
                    the internal iliac of the same side, then in the common iliac of the opposite side, and so forth up
                    to the heart, with the smallest revulsion near the heart, and no derivation.
                    <br>
                    <br>(78) The variable revulsion is a remarkable phenomenon. It is remarkable that the same cause is
                    attributed to both a double and opposing effect. Consider with me, B. L., here and in the argument
                    found in note 75, the recurring nature, and try to dismiss the prejudiced opinions. If there is a
                    channel where a specific amount of fluid is pumped, and branches diverge from it into different
                    spaces, and if it is possible that more fluid than usual can flow into one of these branches,
                    something will be drawn away from all the upper branches; that is, there will be revulsion in them.
                    I have yet to meet anyone who, at first glance, would not recognize this, especially in a friend,
                    where I have proposed this question without them knowing my goal: What would happen in such a
                    branched channel? Cl. Sylva could not prevent this reasoning, but the preconceived opinion, based on
                    the established doctrine, asserts that derivation occurs. I have found the term "variable
                    revulsion," which I believe is the correct term: sideroxylon.
                    <br>
                    <br>(79) On page 37, he writes the following: "It would be a completely inexcusable ignorance,
                    especially in an era where mechanics and anatomy, through their progress, have cast a clear light on
                    the speculations of ancient physicians about the choice of bloodletting: or it would be the
                    humiliating height of a blind prejudice, which has entirely enslaved reason, to neglect the clear
                    benefits of the absolute revulsion, which is always sure, always effective, to substitute the
                    variable revulsion, which is ambiguous, often useless, and almost always harmful." See B. L. § 2,
                    especially the academic opinion on this, note 75, 78.
                    <br>
                    <br>(80) See B. L.'s superstition, which is similar to the ancient belief about the lack of veins in
                    the same place or a divergence.
                    <br>
                    <br>(81) Regarding the revulsion in the opposite axillary, which he establishes on page 44 with the
                    words: "The derivation caused by bloodletting toward the side from which the blood is taken clearly
                    robs the lower aorta and the opposite subclavian artery of a portion of the blood, which without
                    this circumstance should have flowed there." However, asserting this revulsion is not allowed in a
                    constant system, which is required by everyone who sets up and recommends systems. If bloodletting
                    in the foot derives blood from the entire lower aorta and thus from all branches, including the
                    opposite iliac, and if this V.S. in the foot draws blood from the upper aorta, the same reasoning
                    must apply to this upper aorta, such that it triggers derivation in the entire trunk as with the arm
                    V.S., so that it does not draw more blood from the opposite subclavia than V.S. in the foot does
                    from the opposite iliaca. Why should one not cut in the arm when it comes to the vertebral branches
                    in neck inflammation: why not rather in the external carotid, where derivation should also occur, as
                    with the vertebral, and whose small branches there are?
                    <br>
                    <br>(82) See note 78, 81.
                    <br>Pages 111, 112, 113:What we have said so far should not lead to an overly high opinion of
                    bleeding from the neck: this bleeding never has any particular usefulness – neither by virtue of the
                    evacuation nor by the absolute revulsion it produces. And in terms of the derivation it supposedly
                    draws, it is harmful in diseases of the brain when performed at the beginning. Our opinion on this
                    point is fully justified by experience; and the unfortunate consequences of this bleeding when done
                    too early, without first having reduced the volume of blood, have more than sufficiently shown the
                    danger of undertaking it under such circumstances.
                    <br>However, despite this difficulty, several good observers – who have known how to combine sound
                    theory with good practice – having noticed different effects of this bleeding at different times and
                    in similar diseases, and further guided by an analogy (with nosebleeds), whose application is not at
                    all forced, these enlightened practitioners recognized that bleeding from the throat, which is
                    dangerous when used carelessly (that is, prematurely), ceases to be so and instead produces very
                    good effects in cerebral congestion when applied appropriately – that is, after the vessels have
                    already been considerably emptied by several previous bleedings.
                    <br>I repeat, it is rightfully demanded of the founders of systems that they do not abandon them
                    unless they explicitly admit to doing so. Therefore, Sylva, who ardently – even sharply – defends
                    the derivational bleeding against Bianchus, and concedes that it is harmful (for how could he say
                    otherwise without contradicting his own system?), should have said in one word that the jugular
                    bleeding is of no utility with respect to the head.
                    <br>For what he says – that this bleeding can be performed after several others, when the blood
                    volume has already been diminished – is as if he had said nothing at all: it is the same as saying
                    nothing. To say that after sufficient evacuation it not only does no harm but is beneficial is also
                    false. If derivational bleeding is harmful because it draws blood toward an inappropriate area, then
                    it may do less harm when little blood remains – but it cannot do no harm, and certainly cannot be
                    beneficial.
                    <br>Thus, Sylva would certainly have been consistent if he had responded to the defenders of jugular
                    bleeding by saying that it was not harmful because it was done late, after many other medical
                    bleedings – but that it always would have been better to have drawn blood from the leg.
                    <br>I will, however, speak separately about the jugular vein.

                <h3>§. 16.</h3>
                The errors which I have already indicated in part, I will now briefly state together as the most
                significant among all doctrines concerning revulsion and derivation. The first is the division of the
                aorta into an ascending and a descending trunk, and from this, the division of the entire body into two
                regions. Let the following words of the esteemed Martini (p. 3, 4) serve as a model:“When it comes to
                derivation or revulsion, one must pay attention to the point at which the main trunk of the aorta
                divides into a superior and an inferior branch—this is where derivation and revulsion begin.”
                <br>
                <br>But anatomy does not support this division. See the venerable teacher Haller in Comment. Boerh. II,
                p. 345, who says: “Galen was the originator of this error, having dissected brute animals and thus
                introduced the concept of an ascending and descending trunk of the great artery.” Even if this were not
                an anatomical error, one could not describe the arrangement of those trunks any differently than for the
                iliac arteries or any other branching: wherever there is a ramification, there is a trunk and a
                departing branch. Neither the angle formed between trunk and branch nor the diameter of the channels is
                relevant to the question of revulsion and derivation.
                <br>
                <br>Imagine two canals arising from a single point without a third intervening canal. Build several such
                systems of canals, in which the trunk of one becomes the branch of another. It makes no difference what
                the angles or lumens are—the principle that holds in the lowest branches holds in all upper ones: if
                velocity increases in the lowest canal, it will decrease in the companion branch originating from the
                same point, increase in the trunk of those branches, decrease in the trunk’s companion branch, and so
                on.
                <br>
                <br>This will be explained more clearly soon. In the same way, a second error is refuted—namely, that an
                increase in velocity in the lowest canal is believed to increase it in all upper branches, up to the
                point designated as the origin of revulsion and derivation—which does not exist, since the arteries of
                the upper parts are equally branches of the aorta as the celiac or any other. Thus, by this error,
                velocity would also be increased in those arteries of the upper regions.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, they did not consider that all hope or fear regarding revulsion and derivation is nullified
                by the retrograde effect (contrecoup) after a vein is closed. If one assumes the state that arises after
                the opening of a vein is permanent, and that the cause now lies in increased resistance in the artery
                supplying blood to the opened vein—Sylva, I believe, will not hesitate to concede that the effects will
                be opposite to those caused by a resistance-reducing factor.
                <br>
                <br>And will he hesitate to admit that the same will happen if such decreasing and increasing causes
                alternate in a short span of time? If a venous wound is a cause reducing resistance, its closure is a
                cause increasing it. Opposite causes have opposite effects, and when such opposing causes act at the
                same time or in quick succession, as in all opposing determinations, they cancel each other out.
                <br>
                <i> <br>(84)If I were to say to a physicist: "Here is the trunk of a water jet that splits into several
                    branches, each pushing water with a force equal to 10. But do you want to increase that force? Take
                    one of these branches and make an opening (like a bloodletting); immediately the water will flow
                    through each of these pipes with a force equal to 12."
                    <br>If, continuing in the same tone, I were to say: "Notice that these branches are situated one
                    above the other; when you open a branch at the top, you increase the force of the water in all the
                    other branches, except the first. The water, which now rises more in all the others, is diverted
                    from the first. Thus you have one branch that receives less, while the others receive more"—I would
                    be setting forth a wretched doctrine.

                Having finished the labor of recounting the history of the doctrine of revulsion and derivation, and
                having, as it seems to me, sufficiently and fully presented my reasons and arguments, I now turn to the
                question itself and to state my opinion.
                <br>
                <br>The question is twofold: first, whether through the incision of a vein the flow of blood in the
                artery from which the incised vein receives its blood is accelerated;
                <br>
                <br>[85] and second, if we believe that this does occur, what change thereby results in the movement of
                blood in the remaining arteries?
                <br>
                <br>I shall first examine the latter, and then proceed to the former.
                <br>
                <i> <br> (85) Senac, pp. 522, 525 — Let us grant to the defenders of revulsion and derivation the
                    assumptions they ask for; it is upon this acceleration that my difficulties are based.

                <h3>§. 18.</h3>
                <br>
                <br>Let the channel, if you please, be conical, converging, and emitting branches at certain distances:
                it does not matter what angles or cross-sectional areas the channels have, whether they are straight or
                curved, whether the branches are long or short, or whether they themselves divide into further
                branches.Draw, dear reader, any line, and draw another line intersecting it, then at some distance
                another line, and so on; in this way, you can represent the channel as I understand it.The point where a
                branch separates will be called a node.Of the channels arising from the last node, let one — the
                continuation of the trunk — be called A, and the other — the branch diverging from the trunk — be called
                B.The portion of the trunk between the last and the penultimate node is called channel I, that between
                the penultimate and the antepenultimate node channel II, and so on. The remaining branches are called in
                order C, D, and so forth, so that at the penultimate node, channel I and branch C meet, at the
                antepenultimate node, channel II and branch D meet, and so forth.
                <br>
                <br>Into this channel with its branches, a determined quantity of fluid, driven by a constantly acting
                force and unchanged, is forced at every moment, which I call a "wave", so that — as long as nothing
                changes in the branches — at each node a determined quantity, that is, a wave, arrives and is divided
                among the channels arising from that node in a constant ratio.
                <br>
                <br>If, however, the ratio of quantities flowing into A and B changes, I assert that the following will
                occur:
                <br>
                <br>The ratios will change in all nodes after they have arisen and will subsequently remain constant as
                long as the new state persists.
                <br>
                <br>However, the ratios will not change equally in all nodes: the greatest change will occur in the
                penultimate node, a smaller change in the antepenultimate node, and the smallest change in the topmost
                node.
                <br>
                <br>Until the change of ratios successively reaches the topmost node — at which, according to the
                hypothesis, waves always arrive in equal magnitude — the waves arriving at the other nodes and being
                divided into the channels emerging from them will successively change according to the newly arisen
                ratios.
                <br>
                <br>As long as the altered state persists, the new waves will never be identical to the waves that
                reached the same nodes before the change. (†)
                <br>
                <br>The ratio of the mutations in A & B, (86) must be considered as a double case. It can either
                increase or decrease the resistance in either of these channels. Let’s assume a change in channel A. If
                a larger quantity flows into some channel than usual, a derivation occurs, but if it’s smaller, there is
                a reflux.
                <br>
                <br>Let’s assume the ratio in all nodes (87) is the same m : n = quantity in A : qB = q. canal I : qC.
                <br>
                <br>Let’s assume the ratio in the last node is changed to pm : n, and let it either be p > 1 or p < 1,
                    with that reducing the resistance in A, or increasing it. <br>
                    <br>Let any wave be applied to the last node, with all things being intact, coming as P, and let Z
                    signify any wave at any node, at any time.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the steady state, before the change made in A, it is assumed that all tubes can capture a
                    certain quantity at a given time, through all connected determinations, the driving force, and the
                    resistance in each tube due to any causes, and they have all received this at the same time, i.e.,
                    the same quantity has flowed at the same time through all of them.
                    <br>
                    <br>But if we assume that not exactly the same wave applies to any node as can be captured by the
                    originating branches, nevertheless, whatever that wave may be, it will always have the same
                    quantities flowing into the branches at a given time, the same ratio that the quantities flowing
                    through them would have at that same time.
                    <br>
                    <br>Therefore, if the ratio m : n in the first node is changed to pm : n, then tube A, which before
                    the change could capture m/m + n P, can now capture pm/m+n P. But tube B, in which nothing has
                    changed, continues to capture what it could before, which is n/m+n P.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, after this change, channel I can capture what both A and B can jointly capture, i.e., pm +
                    n / m+n P. However, branch C can capture what it could before, namely n/m+n, m+n/m p (but m+n/m p is
                    the wave flowing through the penultimate node at any moment), because it remains unchanged.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, the ratio in place of m : n in the penultimate node will be the ratio of the quantities
                    that channel I & C can capture, namely pm+n P : m+n P * min mt n pmt n mtn. m : n m will be q = pmt
                    n. nt m.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let this same changed ratio in the penultimate node be qm : n. If the other changed ratios are
                    called rm : n, sm : n, and so on, it will be found similarly that effer = qmtn smtn, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>Before the mutation, a wave Z flowed into any branch B, C, D, etc. After the mutation, it will
                    flow into B Z, in C Z, in D Z, etc. pm & n qm't n rm & n. If p = 1, then also y, r, s, etc., will be
                    greater than unity, and if p < 1, the waves in B, C, D, etc. will be smaller than Z. This means that
                        the resistance in A is reduced, and there is a reflux in all branches B, C, D, etc., while
                        increased resistance in A leads to a derivation in B, C, D, etc. q.e.d. first. It is clear that
                        if p> 1, the wave coefficients in B, C, D, etc., increase, and if p < 1, the same coefficients
                            decrease, meaning that the reflux and derivation are greater in C than in B, and greater in
                            D than in C. q.e.d. second. After the ratio in the penultimate node has changed, another
                            wave is sent to the last node, and after the ratio in the antepenultimate node has changed,
                            another wave is sent to the penultimate node. After the change in the uppermost node,
                            because the wave through this node always remains unchanged, the wave is continually
                            forwarded to the next node, then to the antepenultimate, then to the penultimate, and
                            finally to the last node. When the ratio in all nodes is the same and the wave P flows
                            through the last node, the wave is divided in the penultimate node and forwarded to the next
                            node. After the change in the penultimate node, the wave is forwarded to the next node. The
                            succession of waves in the first node is described. <br>
                            <br> If p = 1, then also q, r, s, etc. will be greater than one, and if p < 1, all
                                coefficients gm, qm in mtn m ym m qmtn will decrease, meaning that increased resistance
                                in A causes the wave Z to decrease. This means that both the reflux and derivation will
                                decrease successively. q.e.d. third. When the amount mP is to be sent to branch B,
                                which, before the resistance in channel A changed, was flowing, it will be necessary to
                                send PE Z. It has been previously mentioned that P is a wave that flows successively or
                                through the last node. If we set 13P=f, and n is either greater or smaller, the
                                coefficient in the expression for the wave value becomes z=eP. Therefore, mt n=pm + n
                                mtn, and P=P, pmtn mtn, pmtn. When q=e, it will be mtn : Π e pm tn. If we consider all
                                coefficients in the expressions for z, we will find that if p, q, etc., are> 1, then
                                also sip, q, etc., are < 1, and q will never be less than e. Therefore, neither will q
                                    equal e, nor will pmt.n mtn equal e, and we will not have f=g, but instead it will
                                    be fip, q mtn < 1, and g < f, if p, 91. This means that in all branches B, C, D,
                                    etc., there will either be a derivation or a reflux. q.e.d. fourth and last. <br>
                                    <br> ( + ) If there happen to be some who are less fond of the demonstrations that
                                    follow, they may instead rely on the following reasons for my propositions:
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Because in one of the two branches from the final node — in A or B — the
                                    resistance is changed, the resistance in channel I, from which these branches
                                    receive their liquid, is also changed; and likewise, because the resistance in
                                    channel I is changed, it will also change in channel II, and so forth.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> If the resistance in both branches had changed in the same way, for example, if
                                    it had been halved in both, then the change would also occur similarly in channel I.
                                    But since the change only occurs in one of the branches, the change in channel I
                                    must necessarily be smaller than in A, the change in channel II smaller than in
                                    channel I, and so on.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> After the ratio at the penultimate node is changed, a different wave, distinct
                                    from the previous one, reaches the final node; and another different wave reaches
                                    the penultimate node after the change at the preceding node; and so on, different
                                    waves from node to node. But once the change at the topmost node has occurred, since
                                    the same, unchangeable wave always flows through it, the same wave will always be
                                    transmitted to the next node, then to the penultimate, then the antepenultimate, and
                                    finally the last node.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Because the wave flowing through the topmost node is neither increased nor
                                    decreased, but due to the change made in A, branch A and channels I, II, etc.,
                                    either receive more or less than before, B, C, D, etc., will never again receive
                                    exactly what they did previously.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>(86) The resistance can also be changed simultaneously in both A and B, and this
                                    double change can lead to A and B together capturing either a larger or smaller wave
                                    than before.
                                    <br>However, this case is not relevant to my current purpose, except for the case I
                                    have already presented.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>( 87 ) I hope no one will be so unreasonable as to forbid this, since it greatly
                                    aids brevity and does not affect the matter itself.Instead of the ratio m : n, any
                                    other ratios may be substituted, which will subsequently be done during the
                                    calculation.

                Let the ratios in the nodes be assumed as pm : n, qm : n, and so on. If the ratio pm : n is changed to m
                : n, the ratios in the remaining nodes will also change: let them become aym : n, brmin, and so on.
                <br><br>
                After the ratio is changed in the last node, A takes Q instead of pmn, and B takes Q as before, so that
                channel I receives the wave mt n, while Q in the last node before the change. It now takes Q, and the
                ratio changes in the penultimate node, where pm : n becomes qm : n, and this turns into mtn mtn ym : n =
                aqm : n. Therefore, q = pmtn, so pmt n pmtn mtn, ag = 1, and aqm : n = m : n. Once the initial change is
                removed, all the original ratios return in A, and the effects of the original change and the new one
                cancel each other out.

                <h3>§. 20.</h3>

                Therefore, I have demonstrated what the Ill. Senate has on pages 529, 530, and through an experiment
                conducted in a canal, as I imagine it, he learned that a derivation can only occur in the artery where
                the resistance is small, but that no derivation can occur in the entire body, with the greatest
                resistance occurring in the next branch of the artery. The further one moves away from point V. S., the
                smaller it becomes, until it is no longer perceptible, even at a small distance. That this demonstration
                of mine is contrary to all theories of derivation and resistance theory is evident, so I do not need to
                explain it myself. But there will be those who object to my demonstration being applied to the human
                body. Here, I will use the words of the Ill. Senate: I know that one can oppose me by saying that the
                aorta is a flexible pipe acting on the blood, and that the pipe I have spoken of is a solid pipe, which
                is merely a passive instrument; but I am not unaware of who can raise such an objection to me; I simply
                ask them not to merely point out this difference, but to determine the effects it should produce. Let
                them compare the determinations, which are neither necessary for the general question nor easier for the
                supporters of D. & R. than for Senaco or me: for example, I can say that the ratio of the quantity of
                blood in the external iliac artery to the quantity flowing into the hypogastric artery at any given
                moment is m : n, and this ratio, when it changes in the foot of V. S., can be said to be pm : n, and in
                the same way, the ratio in the bifurcation of the aorta can be said to change to qm : n, until the
                question arises as to whether there is a derivation or reversal in the hypogastric or opposite iliac
                artery? But if this is to be evaluated by D. or R., any number can be substituted for these letters,
                provided that the real numbers can be found.
                <br>
                <br> Excuse me, B. Readers, to whom I may appear to say something unnecessary, but it does not seem
                unnecessary to me for the reasons of others, which I cannot hope to avoid.
                <br>
                <br> Thus, the objections of Cel. Martin against Senactum are as follows, p. 136: Although it cannot be
                denied that the elasticity of the pipes, which correspond to the function of a pump, is very necessary
                to maintain its action, I will not discuss it; since the author does not want the difference between the
                aorta, which is a flexible pipe, and the pipe he speaks of, which is a solid pipe, to be pointed out. I
                will also not bring up the difference between the nature of blood and that of water, which produces many
                other significant differences, as I have already spoken about above. I will now determine, as he wishes,
                the different effects that must necessarily occur in his experiment, and in the workings of the heart
                and arteries in the occasion of bloodletting. The difference in these effects comes from the different
                structure. The author assumes in the case he reports that all the lateral pipes are open (except one,
                which he blocks and then opens), and in the second case, all the pipes are closed, and only one is
                opened, which is then closed again.
                <br>
                <br> It is true that no change occurs in the distant lateral pipes in the case he proposes: but in the
                human body, when the vessels are full, the viscosity of the blood, which flows in the neighboring
                lateral arteries (95), always increases when the vein is opened; whereas the opening of the lateral
                pipe, which had been closed and is then opened, on the contrary decreases the speed of the water in the
                lateral pipes, which was increased when it was blocked; and thus: (96)
                <br>
                <br> As for what this author says, that the blood in the bloodletting of the foot is not diverted from
                the carotid arteries, based on the fact that in his experiment, when the blocked pipe is opened, no
                change occurs in the distant lateral pipes, it is certain that the carotid is a channel that originates
                from the ascending aorta (97) and is therefore completely opposite to the descending aorta.
                <br>
                <br> Exc. Gunzius 1. c. note 17, p. 153, writes:
                <br>
                <br> "The idea of derivation and revulsion depends on the choice of veins in S. M. Regarding this
                subject, there are many books and varying opinions of physicians. (98) Bellinus was the first to try to
                shed light on this matter —
                <br>
                <br> But Cl. Senac questioned it and asked whether it is truly necessary to consider the effect of
                revulsion as so small that it should not be taken seriously. The same opinion is held by Cl. Hamberger.
                And I have no doubt in affirming that physicians place too much trust in derivation and revulsion.
                However, I cannot go against experience, and both opinions seem entirely plausible to me. And although I
                assert (100) that neither flexibility nor the various angles and bends of the channels in C. H. can
                affect the speed of the blood in a different way than in rigid machine channels, without mentioning
                other conditions, it is clear, however, that the driving force in C. H. is double — namely, that of the
                heart and arteries, indeed, even of the muscles. Furthermore, this force is vital and varies daily not
                only throughout the body, but also in the individual parts of the body, which now (100) intensify, now
                diminish. Moreover, blood is a compressible fluid and therefore differs completely from water. Finally,
                the speed at which blood flows is very different depending on the distance from the heart (101). Fifth,
                when a vein is opened, blood will flow from the opening (102) in the vein. Sixth, the disease itself and
                the associated pains in certain parts of the body can cause significant changes, so not everything is
                the same as Hamberger believes. Finally, before the V. S. member is either warmed or rubbed with a rough
                cloth, the movement of blood in that member is greatly increased, while it barely changes in the others.
                <br>
                <br> From this, it follows at least this: the effects of bloodletting cannot be assessed purely by
                hydraulic laws. And although the experience of D. and R. may be hard to confirm, and we do not know the
                method, there is, however, a real difference between revulsion and evacuation, even though Cl. Hamberger
                denies it. Does it not matter where you open the vein? Perform an experiment on a pleuritic patient and
                open the vein in the toe, you will discover that the patient is harmed or helped if you have previously
                opened the vein once or twice in the elbow. (105). See Ill. Trillerus, on pleuritis, especially p. 80."
                <br>
                <br> Apart from what I specifically present in the notes, I give here a general response, repeating
                Senac's words, that nothing is achieved by enumerating the differences between C. H. and human machines,
                unless it is also demonstrated what the effects of those differences are. I am confident that whoever
                attempts it will figure it out through their own effort, but all of this does not relate to the question
                about R. & D., on which question and controversy, as they say, is settled, I would encourage my readers
                to form a correct idea for themselves. The question, however, is whether the vein should be opened at a
                site that is closer to the affected area or at a more remote location, and whether more blood will be
                diverted to another area by V. S., while the amount of blood in another area will be reduced by
                revulsion, and at which sites this will occur?
                <br>
                <br> Nor is it asked what the six hundred other causes, often fortuitous, might affect the distinction
                between this or that site for V. S.? Since those who have been the greatest advocates of R. & D. have
                never considered these, it seems to me that those using such arguments in defense of R. & D., which
                those advocates did not acknowledge, are not only not benefiting from this doctrine but are also
                revealing something harmful.
                <br>
                <i> <br> (88) Therefore, D. Jo. Fr. le Fevre, who in the preface to his works, published in Vesunt in
                    1738, declares the laws of geometry and hydraulics to be useless, and attempts, if I am not
                    mistaken, to show what follows from the difference between their channels and human vessels, since
                    it is necessary to point this out to the troublesome individuals. And if in no other part of medical
                    science, certainly in this doctrine of revulsion and derivation, it is difficult to understand, as
                    seen in § II h. See D. le Fevre's words in the preface, p. XII.
                    <br> "Since the channels of geometers and hydraulics are rigid, fixed, and always remain the same
                    size in the cavity, it is clear that they differ greatly from the blood vessels, which are
                    contractile and elastic, and expand to a larger or smaller cavity depending on diseases, where they
                    either become too loose or are affected by spasms. Moreover, water in hydraulic systems is assumed
                    to be fluid. In contrast, blood in diseases is sometimes more fluid, sometimes thicker, and appears
                    phlegmonous. Therefore, the laws of geometers and hydraulics seem useless, indeed misleading, when
                    attempting to set rules for M.S. states; this is clearly proven by the hallucination of Bellini,
                    who, bound too strictly by geometric laws, in Tr. de M. S. Prop. X, claimed that the safest time for
                    V. S. in fevers was at the onset of the disease."
                    <br> Since nothing has been said except that hydraulic channels and C. H. vessels differ, nothing
                    can be answered: his words indeed express contempt for all mathematics in medicine, against which
                    contempt it is enough to mention Michelotti, Boerhaave, Sauvage. Regarding Bellini, see the note.
                    One cannot be too bound by the geometric laws, if we are speaking of the true geometric laws.
                    However, I am certain that without the restrictions of geometry and physics (I do not mean the
                    geometric truths themselves, but the benefit these disciplines provide to minds by habituating them
                    to the love of truth, unless other obstructions stand in the way), a vast field would be opened to
                    fantasies. If we wish to scorn these aids to discovering the truth, who will we have as a judge in
                    our controversies? Experience? The entire history of medicine teaches that no error in medical
                    practice has ever been without the support of observations. Moreover, this book of D. le Fevre about
                    S. M. has been compiled from authors of all kinds and opinions, so he is not a lover of geometry’s
                    truths.
                    <br>
                    <br> (89) It makes no difference that we know that all these relationships are composed of direct
                    light rays and inverted resistances, and when I often see Sylvam and others pronounce this, I see
                    that they seem to be speaking quite mathematically, just like when they talk about columns removed
                    from Hydrostatics, which is completely unrelated to this question and discipline.
                    <br>
                    <br> (90) Senacus certainly does not wish to be given any excuse, and he does not need such
                    indulgence. The arteries are elastic. Fine; I hear it, and I also read on page 120, to which he
                    refers. Elastic, I say, when they are elastic, they help the heart’s force in propelling the blood,
                    and if they did not, they would soon cease to function at a not too great distance from the heart.
                    They help; they have constantly helped before, they continue to help during V. S. in the place where
                    the derivation occurs, in the place where the resistance is, what does this imply for D. & R.?
                    <br>
                    <br> (91) On page 121, he says: "The blood not only has a movement of liquidity and destruction,
                    like the fluids in fountains, but it also has a fermentation movement that the fluids in fountains
                    do not have, and which contributes not a little to maintaining the movement of the solid parts." I
                    would, however, very much wish that those who tell us so much about fermentation, about the
                    rarefaction of blood, etc., would not wish to be too zealous with terms that have no real meaning.
                    And in offering this generosity greater than to Senacus, what does this have to do with D. & R.?
                    What follows from it? Or will they emphasize the tragedies that Bellinus frightens us with in Prop.
                    III, as we see in the note?
                    <br>
                    <br> (92) On page 118, he wishes for the heart to be considered as a type of pump (recoil pump),
                    composed of two chambers (reservoirs) with two tubes, one made of two arms, the pulmonary artery and
                    vein; the other made from the aorta and the great vein. Senacus claims that this machine differs
                    entirely from his own pump. But what does this difference mean, which does not prevent the one arm
                    of the tube from resembling our aorta? What does this mean for D. & R.? Examining this mechanism is
                    beyond my aim.
                    <br>
                    <br> (93) If the cause of D. & R. is a greater or lesser resistance in a particular tube, Senacus
                    did well to examine the effect of the altered resistance. He closed one of the tubes and then
                    observed the result. Although he could also have chosen not to close it completely, he did so to
                    create a larger or smaller opening, but never none at all.
                    <br>
                    <br> (94) What he truly wants with this, I do not know.
                    <br>
                    <br> (95) Indeed, this is where the question lies; and this is, if I am not mistaken, the crucial
                    point, that Senacus, by rejecting this common view, which he intends to deny, pits his own
                    experience against this experiment.
                    <br>
                    <br> (96) The conclusion that follows is that he denies the right to argue from his own experiment
                    to the effects of V.S.
                    <br>
                    <br> (97) See and marvel at how far this error with the aorta stems extends.
                    <br>
                    <br> (98) With this purpose in mind, I have now finished my work here and merely pointed out that
                    none of these various opinions have lacked my experience.
                    <br>
                    <br> (99) Since it is clear, however, Cl. Gunzius seems to have a great effect, and I would prefer
                    not to disturb Senacus and Hamberger with the gift that Cl. Gunzius will receive as soon as it seems
                    necessary to request it. But there are two questions concerning these mentioned points: whether they
                    have any effect, and what effect they have.
                    <br>
                    <br> (100) Does this double force change through V.S.? I ask that it be shown what the change is. If
                    this force is not altered by V.S., but perhaps by other causes that are sometimes intensified and
                    sometimes diminished, then this becomes a different question, distinct from that of R. & D.
                    <br>
                    <br> (101) But these distances are constant before V.S., during it, and after it, and therefore the
                    velocities, as they depend on these distances, are constant. Whatever they may be, the question is
                    whether they are intensified or diminished through V.S.?
                    <br>
                    <br> (102) I admit that I do not understand this.
                    <br>
                    <br> (103) What are these changes? And if they are caused by pain, are they not caused by V.S.? Let
                    us consider a pleuritic patient. I see significant changes caused by the disease and associated
                    pain. The question is whether the vein in the arm or foot should be opened? Which of these is more
                    relevant for the changes occurring in the affected side of the chest? Is it the section of the arm,
                    which pulls away from the chest, directing blood to the foot, or is it due to these changes?
                    <br>
                    <br> (104) Let us again take a pleuritic patient. Can the area be warmed? And the question is
                    whether it is more effective to warm the leg or the arm? Or can it be done on the foot instead?
                    <br>
                    <br> (105) The accepted theory does not prevent it from happening in the desired place. If, as it
                    has been stated, this theory is not very convincing to Cl. Gunzius, I would like him not only to
                    mention which venous sections should be opened but also to determine this precisely, and not merely
                    attempt to defend this common theory. If he agrees to use the terms "revulsio" and "derivatio," he
                    should define them precisely in relation to their meaning.

                I will add a briefly calculated estimate to show how small the effect should be in the upper channels of
                my own and the analogous branches of the aorta due to the change in resistance in channel A or the
                analogous femoral artery.
                <br>
                <br> The change in the ratio should be investigated at the fifth node before the last, i.e., where A and
                B originate. The ratio to be investigated is: n. fifth. It will be u = tmtn = smtn mtn ' q = pmtn mtn
                mtn, The development of the value u excludes the area.
                <br>
                <br> Until now, equal ratios for the individual nodes have been used for brevity. Now, the unequal
                ratios should be set up and replaced by the following: 4:3, 1:1, 8:3, 9:4, 7:2, which come from the
                quickly estimated order of the quantities inflowing into Iliaca externa and hypogastrica, into both
                Iliacas at the division node of the aorta, into the aortic trunk and the lower mesenteric artery, into
                the aortic trunk and the renal arteries connected, into the aortic trunk and the superior mesenteric
                artery, and the connected celiac artery.
                <br>
                <br> Smaller branches from the aorta are omitted, not only because of the general theory of D. & R.'s
                harm, but also due to its benefit.
                <br>
                <br> Let's seek the ratio in order q = 4p + 3 = qt1 s = 87 + 3 = 9514 8 = 7812 7 2 , II? It will be
                found u = 2016 p † 16002 / 18018. Assume p = 2, then u = 20034 / 18018.
                <br>
                <br> Assume the ratio of the amount in the aorta to the lower flow as the amount flowing into the upper
                branches = 5:3. Assume the amount in the upper branches is what flows at any moment of time, say z,
                which represents the wave in each systole of the heart, pumped into the aorta. All whole values will be
                e = 3 513, but when the ratios change, it becomes e = 3 54 + 3.
                <br>
                <br> Therefore, if p = 2 = 5405:154224 and if p = 12, it will be 5405:139104 = 13.8 41,3 8 74. Ergo,
                if the resistance in the Iliaca externa decreases so that p = 2, there will be a resistance in the upper
                aortic branches corresponding to revulsion 1 -2.41. And if the resistance in the Iliaca externa
                increases, so that p = 1 in the upper aortic branches, there will be a derivation of 1 1 74 z 1 2. But
                what could V.S. do in the leg to make p = 2, or what obstruction would make p = -?

                From the given ratios, it follows that approximately 4.27 = 1.14 wave of blood enters the foot, which
                57981 89 13 и is ejected by the heart in each systole, and overall, the same portion of the entire blood
                mass is in the foot. Blood is supplied to the branches of the aortic arch. I suppose it is supplied to
                the internal carotid and vertebral arteries; it seems to be supplied to the external carotids as well,
                leaving a need for one arm (3): 9.8692 approximately. You see B.L., who has quickly made the
                calculation, since no one really wants to estimate these ratios of quantities flowing into the arteries,
                even expressed with small numbers, yet it seems quite plausible.
                <br>
                <br> Let us assume that in the first minute, 72 beats press the artery, with each systole forcing 2
                ounces of blood from the heart into the aorta. Let us assume that an open vein in the foot over 4
                minutes of time emits a pound during this time. This pound is not yet a third of the blood that enters
                the foot during this time. Barely within 4 minutes, the pound is emitted, and the pulse becomes much
                more frequent.
                <br>

                <h3>§. 23.</h3>
                Up to now, everyone has claimed that the blood flow in the artery from which the blood of the severed
                vein originates is accelerated by V. S. Is this true? This is the second part of the dispute.
                <br>
                <br>What I have stated so far, I will repeat. I will use Cl. Senac’s words: "We have only considered the
                outside of the system that today determines the choice of veins: let us examine the foundations of this
                system, the fundamentals of the derivation and the revulsion appear to me uncertain: here are my
                difficulties."
                <br>
                <br>First, my calculation, as I have already pointed out, shows that the amount of blood sent into the
                arm within the same time is more than tripled, so there is no fear that blood will be deficient in the
                vein after the section, unless it is hastened by derivation.
                <br>
                <br>Next, consider what happens in V. S., for example in the arm: a long wound occurs with almost no
                width. For the blood to flow, the edges of the wound must be stretched apart without weakening the
                forces by which it moves. But before V. S., in the vein, the opening for the blood flow is much larger
                than the wound, and it is not blocked, except that, as they say, the subsequent blood flow may prevent
                the previous one. I conclude that the original and accustomed path of the blood is easier than the new
                one, and it will not flow out of it unless forced by other causes.
                <br>
                <br>A band is then applied to the arm. The person is instructed to move the muscles. The band prevents
                the blood flow in the vein and around the other veins, unless they press tightly together, changing the
                original circular form into an oblong shape, thereby reducing the volume of blood passing through. The
                obstructed path forces the sides of the veins outward, and the anastomotic connections open, allowing
                blood to spill out of the wound.
                <br>
                <br>The movement of the adjacent muscles promotes blood flow through the veins, and any muscle
                contraction creates a large arc of blood springing out. Is it likely that more blood will flow out
                through a small wound, as I mentioned, than through the place where the vein was bound and the blood
                should flow back to the heart? Is it necessary to establish that the blood should be derived and sent
                out through V. S.?
                <br>
                <br>If the arm is not tied or moved, blood does not flow out.
                <br>
                <br>However, it is clear that the exit of the hindering blood prevents the subsequent blood from
                flowing. Why does blood not come from the arteries at an accelerated pace? Why is it not being diverted?
                <br>
                <br>Finally, the argumentation of the states R. & D. should be examined: because the preceding blood
                prevents the subsequent one. When the hindrance is removed by providing an easier path through the
                created wound, blood flows more quickly in the vein, both in its origins and in the capillary arteries
                corresponding to the venous capillaries, and in their arterial trunks.
                <br>
                <br>This argument faces opposition from the blood circulation through the smallest vessels. It is true
                that in the branched channels, which are not too narrow, arteries and veins fit together in such a way
                that it would not be said that fluid could pass from one channel to another through the narrow branches
                when the fluid is already being pushed through the channel.
                <br>
                <br>But the smallest arterioles, according to microscopic examination, not only have diameters no larger
                than the diameters of blood cells, but are also said to be smaller, as they do not admit globules unless
                they are changed into an elongated shape, and individual and separated globules cannot move freely. Many
                other causes show that the pulse is not just a result of the heart’s force at the limits of the arteries
                and veins. Therefore, the blood in the veins cannot delay the subsequent blood in the arteries because
                it is not moved by its impulse, as it would be possible to exchange the forces with which the arterial
                blood is moving. However, there is no need to discuss the causes of blood movement in the veins in this
                context.
                <br>
                <br>(106) During the time of Nero, the most immediate way to death was considered the release of the
                veins, which, due to the fear of the executioner's death, quickly set the process in motion. However,
                many historical accounts from Tacitus show that it was often slower than the wishes of the sufferers.
                The interrupted vein, although injured, released only a small amount of blood. Petronius opened the
                bound veins at will, began the pathways, and indulged in sleep. Seneca, exhausted by cruel tortures and
                having failed with the previously ingested poison, ultimately decided to bathe in hot water. Pompeia
                Paullina, his wife, after Nero ordered her death to be stopped, with blood pressure applied, though with
                uncertainty, later added a few more years to her life. Her face and limbs turned so pale that it was
                evident she had lost much vital spirit. Death was near wherever it occurred, seeming to come from the
                severed arteries.
                <br>
                <br>(107) Regarding the leg without binding, even though it only flows slowly and often with the aid of
                the remaining resources, blood flows from the wounded vein, as the weight of the blood itself causes it.
                One can also see how the veins in the hanging arm quickly fill when it is raised.

                <h3>§. 25*.</h3>
                The argument based on the slowness of circulation in the smallest vessels is used by the esteemed Mr.
                Senac to show that neither derivation (redirecting) nor revulsion (diversion) can have the great effects
                claimed by proponents of traditional theory. I have already discussed this hope and fear above and
                believe I have refuted it. But now, B.L., listen to Senac himself, on page 517:
                <br>
                <br> "Let us suppose an inflammation in some organ, and let us further assume that this inflammation is
                confined within the volume of a cubic inch. It is certain that the damage could easily spread from this
                small inflamed area to the entire organ, and even to the whole body.
                <br>
                <br> What, then, could revulsion or derivation achieve in such a space, in this cubic inch where the
                source of the disease lies? Derivation will not bring more fluid to it than already arrived there before
                the derivative bleeding, if fluids reach it only with extreme slowness and in very small quantity.
                <br>
                <br> For the same reason, revulsion will not remove more fluid either; the quantity diverted will be so
                small as to be negligible.
                <br>
                <br> Since the blood moves so slowly through the capillaries and reaches the supposed site of
                inflammation only through numerous obstacles, should one then dismiss doubts about the dangers of
                derivation?
                <br>
                <br> Could streams of blood, pushed along by derivation – streams moving with extreme slowness and
                barely influenced by the heart’s propulsion – actually cause tears and ruptures in the arteries they
                pass through?
                <br>
                <br> To fear such disruption from derivative bleeding would be like fearing that a trickle of water,
                whose flow is utterly imperceptible, might overturn dikes due to its supposed violence."
                <br>
                <br> Here I must also mention the experiments of Antonio de Heyde regarding bloodletting and similar
                topics against Bellini's then-new book on the same matter. I will not examine his arguments against
                Bellini in detail, but will very briefly summarize his observations made on frogs. He says that the flow
                of blood in the smaller vessels is inconsistent, not only in relation to the different and opposite
                endpoints, but also in terms of velocity (page 9).
                <br>
                <br> He observed that at a wound of a vein, not only did blood from the injured vein itself flow out,
                but also through anastomoses from nearby veins and even via a retrograde motion from the trunk to which
                the cut vein was connected, so that blood flowed to the wound from all sides — from the periphery toward
                the center (p. 2). This was observed in the cutaneous veins (p. 4), in vessels of the abdominal muscles
                (p. 5), and in the mesentery, where he tied off a venous trunk on both sides, so that the isolated
                section, along with its supplying veins joined by anastomoses, formed a vascular system much like the
                veins of the arm when a ligature is applied during venesection (see preceding paragraph).
                <br>
                <br> After a short time, when the veins had been emptied, blood ceased to flow because a clot formed at
                the wound. Once this clot was removed after a short while, the blood began to flow again, having
                meanwhile forced its way through the narrow channels of the capillaries (see preceding paragraph).
                <br>
                <br> At the wound of an arterial branch, blood flowed not only from the main trunk but also from
                neighboring side branches (which is the revulsion I have shown above to be greatest in the nearest
                branch) and from the portion of the cut branch within the wound. However, another observation on page 6
                differs, where it is said that blood also flowed faster in a lateral branch.
                <br>
                <br> In the portion of the cut artery below the wound, the true revulsion described by Senac (p. 531)
                occurred. That is: the sides of the artery, contracting both toward the heart and toward the veins,
                attempt to propel the blood, giving an idea of the mechanism of the pulse. Thus, when the pressure from
                the blood behind is removed (because the blood now exits through the wound), the blood already within
                the lower part of the artery is forced to reverse its path. A similar experiment shows that when a
                ligature is applied to a mesenteric vessel, the artery between the intestine and the ligature swells, as
                the fluid retrogrades and presses against the ligature. See Senac in the cited place and especially my
                illustrious and venerable teacher de Haller in the commentaries on Boerhaave II, p. 302. There will
                still be occasion to say more about this revulsion.

                <h3>§. 26.</h3>
                I now come to a difficult discussion for a young man — namely, about practical rules. I fear that there
                will be some who will try to intimidate me with Galen's words (108):
                <br>
                <br>"Not only reason but also experience teaches that different types of evacuation are suited to
                different parts of the body."
                <br>
                <br>Or who, like Baglivi (109), will reproach me with sharp words:
                <br>
                <br>"Despite the continuous circulation of fluids, there are nonetheless revulsions and derivations of
                humors in the treatment of diseases. The truth of this thesis is confirmed daily by experience in caring
                for the sick. Let the delicate theorists from the school of hypothesis chatter all they want."
                <br>
                <br>Those who will be indignant with me, those who will calmly echo Baglivi’s view against me, are
                mostly the ones described by Senac — those who believe that the truths of medicine have been entrusted
                to them alone like a hidden treasure, and who think it the most righteous cause for anger if anyone else
                professes a different opinion. These gentlemen I beg: before they continue reading what I shall say
                about experience — which, I admit, they are usually convinced stands on their side — let them first
                reread what I wrote in Chapter 9, Paragraph 11.

                <br>(109)Methodus medendi, Book XIII, Chapter 11, Volume X, page 304 — as I have already said above,
                this passage is clearly not against me, even though it might seem so.Here are more of Galen’s words:
                <br>
                <br>"Whether the internal vein, the middle vein, the humeral vein, the one near the ankle, or the one in
                the popliteal fossa should be opened, is determined by the affected part."
                <br>
                <br>After the part I have already cited in this paragraph, the following words continue:
                <br>
                <br>"For you have seen that some, whose eyes had begun to be inflamed by phlegmone, were cured in a
                single day by purging through the bowels alone; but if anyone were to attempt this in the case of the
                liver at the onset of phlegmone, he would provoke a massive inflammation."
                <br>
                <br>Thereafter follows what I cited in the note.

                <h3>§. 27.</h3>
                All true and certain experience, the great teacher, daily shows through countless examples that it is
                often poorly consulted, poorly understood, and not infrequently becomes the unwilling advocate of false
                doctrines.To mention only what pertains to bloodletting: those who insisted that the stars, which were
                said to govern mankind, must be consulted before bleeding — a superstition once taken seriously (110)
                but now ridiculed — also appealed to experience.It was likewise considered experiential knowledge that
                great importance should be attached to the selection of veins at the same site, such as in the arm or
                hand.Experience has been opposed to experience in the dispute about bloodletting in pleurisy that raged
                two centuries ago: the so-called Arabs, who according to ancient custom advised letting blood from the
                side opposite to the affected area, were opposed by Brissot (111), relying on the successes of himself
                and his disciples.And to offer a distinctive example — an older one, as modern examples often cause
                offense — Galen (112) says:
                <br>
                <br>"In those where blood spontaneously bursts forth according to its natural course, it brings great
                benefit if it occurs from the side affected; but when it bursts forth from the opposite side, it does no
                good, and sometimes even harms, because it depletes the patient's strength without alleviating the
                disease.For example, blood erupting from the right nostril does not help a swelling of the spleen (on
                the left side), nor does blood from the left nostril help a swelling of the liver (on the right
                side).However, bleeding from the right nostril quickly relieves if the swelling is located in the right
                hypochondrium, and similarly on the left."
                <br>
                <br>Thus, I think it is fair for me to demand this: that I should be allowed to treat all observations
                that claim to be based on experience but are plainly false as, at least, suspicious.

                I will not, in detail, logically discuss here the various fallacies by which one may be deceived during
                experiments, but I am content to have pointed out how much preconceived opinions can influence us. I
                would also emphasize that the most frequent fallacy is the so-called "false cause fallacy" — a fallacy
                which, just as in all of natural philosophy, also in its most specialized part, medicine, most often
                deceives all but the most attentive and sharp-sighted individuals.
                <br><br>
                Now, in our present question, whoever investigates examples of this fallacy will find so many that he
                will hardly wonder at how rare true observations and experiments really are, those that authors have
                purposefully and diligently conducted for this purpose. Indeed, I have found only a single example — by
                the illustrious Triller, whom I will discuss shortly. And if one considers the immense difficulty of
                conducting such an experiment — for example, in pleuritic patients, to examine whether it is more
                beneficial to open a vein in the arm or in the foot, or whether it is better to open a vein in the arm
                of the affected side or the opposite — it becomes clear that the entire constitution of the patients and
                all circumstances of the disease must be equal, and the experiment must be repeated several times.

                <h3>§. 29.</h3>
                Having set aside those defenders of the doctrine of revulsion and derivation (113) whose arguments seem
                to me of little importance, I will now examine some examples and special cases proposed for this purpose
                by distinguished men.
                <br>
                <br>First, Baglivi, who in the passage I cited appeals to daily experience and criticizes the delicate
                hypothesis-builders — in a book, by the way, which perhaps more clearly than any other in medical
                history shows how a massive system can be erected on a flimsy hypothesis. Thus, Baglivi, it seems to me,
                should not have been so severe, but instead should have been content — among the countless examples he
                claims could be cited — with the case of Lindanus, as reported by (114) Ettmüller.
                <br>
                <br>Baglivi continues:"If menstruation is imminent, a vein in the arm should be opened, and the blood
                will flow; if the same vein is opened during menstruation, the flow will stop; however, it will not stop
                if the saphenous vein is opened."
                <br>
                <br>I do indeed doubt the truth of this rule. That menstruation can be suppressed by bloodletting I
                easily believe — since it is an effect of plethora, which bloodletting can reduce. But whether it is
                more effective to do so via the arm than the foot, I am uncertain. Baglivi goes on:
                <br>
                <br>"In cases of difficult childbirth, if a vein in the arm is opened, the fetus will be delivered; and
                in cases of urinary retention, opening the same vein causes the urine to flow, according to Forestus."
                <br>
                <br>That bloodletting either from the arm or the foot could ease childbirth or even cause abortion is
                hardly still believed today. Where a vein is opened, it serves the mother's, not the fetus' cause. As
                for the second example regarding urinary retention, I do not see what it proves.
                <br>
                <br>Baglivi likewise states on page 141 among other aphorisms:"I have observed in fevers caused by a
                change in weather in Rome that, when blood was drawn from the arm, sleep immediately followed; but not
                so when drawn from the foot."
                <br>
                <br>Baglivi writes:
                <br>
                <br>"In malignant fevers, when blood was drawn from the arm, the patient worsened, and the full force of
                the disease was directed toward the head, leading shortly thereafter to delirium, sleepiness, etc.;
                however, when blood was drawn from the foot, patients improved: this we observed in Rome at the
                hospital."
                <br>
                <br>To judge the truth of this aphorism, detailed and accurate case histories for each patient would be
                necessary. It is in the nature of malignant fevers that bloodletting often does not benefit many
                patients, due to the complex interplay of circumstances that must be individually assessed in each case.
                And not only in malignant but also in ordinary acute fevers, a single bloodletting rarely suffices to
                defeat the fever; the disease, initially appearing weakened, often grows again after the first
                bloodletting.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, if the disease worsens after a first bleeding from the arm but improves after a subsequent
                bleeding from the foot, it is easy for many to attribute the difference to the site of the bleeding —
                without considering that it is natural for the later and likely stronger bloodletting to have a greater
                effect than the first. Compare the example of the young man in (115) Sydenham: when he seemed nearly
                dead, after opening a vein and drawing somewhat more blood, the fever erupted with an intensity that
                even the elderly Sydenham said he had rarely seen.
                <br>
                <br>I also note this against the story told by Cel. Martini on p. 115 about a woman suffering from
                erysipelas of the head. After a jugular vein was opened against Martini’s wishes and without his
                knowledge, the swelling in her face worsened. Previously, five bloodlettings had been performed on the
                arm; then, following Martini’s instructions, a bloodletting from the foot was performed, followed by
                several more, and the patient was ultimately cured.
                <br>
                <br>Martini's reason for forbidding the opening of the jugular was that he foresaw blood being drawn
                toward the head if the vessels were not yet sufficiently emptied. Yet in acute diseases, the limit for
                bloodletting is uncertain and must be determined by symptoms. The five earlier bleedings from the arm,
                likely individually small (as is common among the French), could not break the force of the progressing
                disease. Only after the sixth bleeding from the foot — apparently more vigorous — and further subsequent
                bleedings, the disease was finally conquered.
                <br>
                <br>What I have pointed out thus far also seems to apply to the history of the third and fourth patients
                described by Ill. Triller on page 79 of his excellent book on pleurisy: a stable boy, Johannes, a strong
                and full-blooded young man of 21 years, and Peter, a tall, lean, blood-phlegmatic man of 33 years — both
                struck by pleurisy at precisely the same moment.”
                <br>
                <br>"After drinking spirits during the night and feeling the discomfort that followed, Trillerus
                continued to observe the patients, particularly Johannes, who was in a desperate condition.”
                <br>
                <br>"Thus, he said, to experiment and see how much of a difference it would make between the
                bloodletting in the affected area and one farther from it, he took twelve ounces of blood from the right
                arm of Johannes, who was still suffering from severe delirium and suffocation symptoms. As for Peter, he
                took just as much, or even more, but from the right leg.
                <br>
                <br>After doing this, the former (Johannes) in less than two hours immediately recovered, began to
                breathe more freely, and could expectorate more easily. He fell into a peaceful sleep for several hours
                and then rested calmly, with a gentle sweat covering his body. No further bloodletting was needed
                throughout the course of the illness.
                <br>
                <br>Peter, on the other hand, felt no relief at all from the bloodletting.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, having gathered more reliable and clearer evidence from this uncertain experiment, I decided
                on the morning of the fourth day to perform bloodletting on the same patient’s right arm, extracting
                nearly ten ounces of blood. Although the blood flowed freely and the wound was not yet sealed, the
                patient immediately felt relief and comfort, and joyfully confessed to us that it seemed as though a
                heavy weight had been lifted from his chest."
                <br>
                <br>I confess that in Johannes I see rather the remains and signs of drunkenness associated with a
                milder pleurisy, rather than the severe negative effects that the beautifully written history of the
                nine remaining cases demonstrates, those effects, I say, that appear after one or sometimes two rounds
                of bloodletting. If Johannes's severe and fierce delirium was due to pleurisy, it is certainly strange
                that there was no need for repeated bloodletting throughout the course of the illness.
                <br>
                <br>As for Peter, the tall and thin one, I see that in pleuritis cases like his, the nature of the
                illness is not typically responsive to just one bloodletting. I repeat the point that Peter underwent
                another venesection in his arm. To resolve all doubt, accuracy is needed, especially in the difficult
                task of assessing the causes of the progression and the predisposing factors.
                <br>
                <br>Ill. Trillerus himself ordered a bloodletting from the patient's foot because, as he said, no bloody
                sputum was being expectorated and the pain in both sides remained fixed. Shortly afterward, all symptoms
                seemed to improve: the patient returned in the evening, and by the fifth day, he had a large hemorrhage
                from the nose, severe headache, and his condition was relieved.
                <br>
                <br>To make the experiment once more, Ill. Trillerus ordered a vein to be opened in Peter's foot. In
                more than forty pleuritic cases, he praises the successful outcome of bloodletting in the affected area,
                as stated on page 31. I easily believe this, but this does not negate the arguments of those who say
                that the issue is not which location, but how much blood is drawn. Indeed, in just as many patients, a
                vein was not opened on the opposite side.
                <br>
                <br>He says, on page 30, that based on experience and the nature of the disease, bloodletting should be
                performed only in the arm of the affected side. I seek an explanation for this but find none, certainly
                not on page 83, where he says that help should be given to the affected parts, which are still not fully
                healed, for this is precisely the issue at hand: which location of venesection should be preferred.
                <br>
                <br>Ill. Morgagnus tells a story in his letter to Valsalva, in the 13th addition of his work, § 24,
                which he received from his teacher, Paolo Salano. Here, a woman who had suffered from apoplexy with
                paralysis on both sides was treated by having bloodletting performed on the right side, after which the
                disease was relieved on the left side of the body; then, after bloodletting on the left, the disease was
                relieved on the right.
                <br>
                <br>I must confess, venerable as the name Morgagnianum is, I do not fully understand the reasons
                justifying why I should consider this as a mere coincidence, which, though it did not occur to Morgagnus
                himself but was instead relayed by his teacher Salano, I find hard to believe. The reason being that a
                single bloodletting (V. S.) was not sufficient to completely resolve the apoplexy, leading to the
                condition where only one side of the paralysis was relieved, specifically on the left side, after a
                second bloodletting had removed the main problem. It was indeed by chance that the paralysis was
                resolved on the left side, and then the bloodletting started from the right side. Had the same quantity
                of blood been drawn from the right side initially, the remaining paralysis on the right side would
                likely have also resolved.
                <br>
                <br>If anyone would deny me this allowance, they bear the heavy burden of proving that it was not
                possible for the opposite side to recover before the right side. It seems to me a grave task for anyone
                attempting to explain this based on the reasoning provided by Ill. Morgagnus, who claims that the veins
                of the right side are more commonly connected to the head. Blood is said to have been drawn from both
                sides, but not from a specific location. Furthermore, it seems probable to me that in hemiplegia, blood
                should be drawn from the unaffected side, rather than from the side already paralyzed. This is not only
                due to Valsalva’s reasoning and his opinion on the paralysis of the opposite side of the brain, which I
                have seen in experiments to be true, but also due to the common doctrine of R. and D. (Right and Left),
                since the flow of blood in the muscles of the affected side is sluggish, and it is likely that the
                circulation of that part of the body is impaired. I believe that even the arterial walls must become
                paralyzed.
                <br>
                <br>I add to these opposing examples another one that favors my argument, narrated by Vallisnero in Eph.
                Germ. Cent. VI, p. 191. A woman, tormented by headache, has blood drawn from both her arm and her leg in
                vain. The wound recurs, and while sleeping, three pounds of blood are lost. Eventually, the pain ceases.
                This example, in agreement with Vallisnero, teaches us that it is not where, but rather how much blood
                is drawn, that matters.

                I have shown in particular examples and cases observed that the common doctrine of revulsion and
                derivation is largely favored, and how I would judge six hundred other cases. I will add a brief
                discussion on the canons and axioms of general practitioners, especially with the aim of showing that
                their methods are contradictory to each other, and particularly that they are contradictory to the
                common doctrine of R. & D. This dispute among the authors is not a trivial matter, certainly against the
                most secure prejudice of authority, see §. III, where I deny that the choice of veins in V.S. is of
                great importance. I, who easily reconcile the dissenters, believe I have the right to earn their
                support, for when they oppose each other and their experiments stand in contrast, they will destroy
                their own authority, but I, who easily accept observations from both sides, when successful observations
                of either this or that V.S. at the correct site have been made, consult both authorities.
                <br><br>
                I believe I have the right to demand that those who believe that revulsion and derivation are achieved
                through V.S. recognize that there are significant effects, and either embrace some known theory, or, if
                none of them appeal, form their own theory and stick to it without deviation. Those who wish to examine
                the authors’ books will find that, unless I am mistaken, the terms of derivation and revulsion are
                frequently used, and experiments and observations that claim to demonstrate the effects of derivation
                and revulsion are often cited. However, a theory explaining how these processes occur, at which sites
                they should be performed to produce the necessary effects, will be scarcely found. There are very few
                experiments conducted with the purpose and precision required to eliminate all doubt, and I would say
                there are none. It is often the case with those called practical that they disdain theories, meaning
                that for most of their lives, there is either no doubt, or they lack the desire to deal with the
                question.

                And since there is a great controversy about the usefulness of venous derivation, for almost everyone
                agrees that revulsion is useful. Bellinus severely criticizes Sylva for recommending derivation at the
                end of inflammatory diseases, a mistake that seems to have been influenced by Sylva’s prejudice against
                authority, thus diminishing the praise of Sylva as the first to present a theory of derivation and
                revulsion. This dispute was discussed by Sylva with Biancho in T. I. p. 69-106, and with Hecquet in the
                entire second volume. Sylva’s book on the subject was written for this reason, with Quesnay defending
                derivation, and Chevalier and Martin condemning it; however, they too have contradicted themselves, as I
                have already shown in notes 53 and 54. In my opinion, if R. & D. are admitted, Sylva is correct in
                denying the usefulness of derivation, except in cases of menstrual obstruction. Revulsion and derivation
                are opposing ideas and opposing effects: if revulsion is useful, as all agree in inflammatory diseases,
                I do not see how the opposite derivation could be useful. It is believed that revulsion occurs because
                the disease is removed from the inflamed area, and that the small arteries will expel the obstructing
                material under pressure. However, it is believed that derivation forces the obstructing material to move
                elsewhere, or, if it cannot yield, it is pressed more forcefully. After some revulsive V.S., it is said
                that derivation should be performed. Those who say this seem to say nothing of value. It is inevitable
                that revulsive and derivatory V.S. with their opposing effects will cancel each other out.

                You have seen how Ill. Trillerus vigorously defends bloodletting in pleuritis in the arm of the affected
                side, which is indeed the most common practice; listen to the opposing view of D. Chevalier on p. 111.
                "It is now demonstrated that bloodletting in the arm on the affected side of pleuritis determines a
                greater quantity of blood to the diseased part, and that bloodletting in the opposite arm significantly
                diverts it." Shall we renew the war fought two hundred years ago?

                In cases of head diseases, most commonly prescribe bloodletting in the foot, except for a few, among
                whom the most prominent is Sydenham, but also many others, who almost always, when blood needs to be let
                out and blood is not sparingly given, perform the bloodletting in the arm due to its surgical and other
                advantages. Those who argue that derivation and revulsion can occur, surely if they sincerely support
                their hypothesis, cannot avoid condemning bloodletting in the arm for head diseases, which was also the
                case with Sylva, although more cautiously. As I mentioned, Sylva criticizes cautiously, while others,
                who respect the authority of those who stand by the practice, do not dare to condemn it. Hence, the
                divergence among authors, some denying that bloodletting in the arm for head diseases can be a form of
                derivation, while others say it can only be revulsive, but only when done laterally. Still, others do
                not deny that bloodletting can be derivation, but claim that the effects of derivation are always
                harmful. Among the prominent authors who have written on head diseases, such as Lancisius and Wepfer,
                there is hardly any mention of R. & D. through bloodletting.

                <h3>§. 33.</h3>
                In the severing of the jugular vein, there is a common disagreement (118). I, who believe that the
                selection of veins should be done carefully, certainly allow the selection of veins, but not that it is
                either a derivating or revulsive effect. The reason is that it is generally overlooked by Freind, whose
                trust and experience are among the best arguments supporting the significance of this V. S., but which
                was demonstrated by Lancisi due to the private structure of the venous channels in the brain, which are
                called sinuses. The benefit of this structure is that in the irregular channels, which accommodate to
                angles and bends, fluid may accumulate, never exceeding the usual amount, and this has practical
                implications in certain head diseases where more blood is directed to the head. This structure prevents
                these channels from bursting and pressing on the brain, especially if the fluid in the ventricles cannot
                be easily absorbed. Therefore, I believe that the external jugular vein is useful for draining the
                internal one, particularly near the upper larynx. The effect of this V. S. teaches that the opposite
                effect may be death from strangulation, similar to the death in apoplexy, but also a brief cessation of
                breath, which can best be achieved by constriction of the abdomen. The redness of the face in phrenitis
                seems to be explained here, especially if one considers paraphrenitis, which arises from inflammation of
                the diaphragm, causing severe respiratory distress. With the tying of the external jugular veins, this
                effect is not observed, and death may occur more slowly, but this ligature can certainly cause serious
                problems. Boerhaave’s lectures attribute this to Feyer, and another experiment from Stenoni shows that
                an animal became apopleptic after the tying of the jugular vein, but Haller did not find this in their
                books. Lowerus observed in a dog that after some hours the areas above the ligature became swollen, and
                within two days the dog died almost as if from strangulation: Hydrops was observed. I performed the
                experiment myself. I first tied the dog’s external jugular vein on one side, then on the other side.
                There was not much swelling above the thread, and the dog did not become lethargic, but was almost
                active the entire day, constantly barking. It survived further experiments. The portion below the thread
                was quickly refilled with air with each breath. I now lack the opportunity to replicate Lowerus’s work,
                and his description is somewhat unclear as he mentions tying the jugular veins, without specifying if
                they were the external ones, which is difficult to do on a dog.
                <br>
                <br>I would not wish to deny the effect of the experiment with the severing of the jugular vein, for
                this experiment demonstrates that there is significant communication between the internal and external
                jugular veins through their anastomoses, and it is almost equally certain that it creates an easy path
                for draining the internal vein and its sinuses, if any causes lead to increased filling of the external
                vein.

                There is also a significant controversy regarding the place of V. S. in menstrual obstructions. It is
                common to cut in the foot, the effects of which are explained by Sylva, as seen earlier with B. L.
                Lindanus' doctrine is well-known with ( 125 ) Ettmuller, and the most famous story is that of the
                Riveriana woman."Lindanus recommends cutting the vein in the arm when the menstruation is imminent but
                has not yet started. When the menstruation has already started, or if it is suddenly interrupted, then
                it is advised to open the saphena. However, cutting the vein in the foot is never advised unless
                menstruation is in progress or the flow has been suppressed."
                <br>
                <br>Freind ( 126 ) rejects Lindanus and Ettmuller with a very good argument:"If menstruation, he says,
                is flowing and the saphena section recalls it, why should it not be possible to induce flow even outside
                the menstruation?" The famous story of the Riveriana woman, who stated that cutting the vein of the
                malleolus stopped menstruation, but when the blood was sent from the arm, it flowed more abundantly.
                <br>
                <br>However, I do not consider this of great importance, even though I do not oppose it, as it is a
                single case and does not present a complete and accurate account that includes all the circumstances of
                the woman’s illness, to which many treatments were applied by the doctors. For V. S. in the arm, as
                Lindanus recommends, there is also Cl. ( 128 ) Mauriceau, while Freind supports cutting in the foot. I
                believe we should consider Freind’s theory of plethory. This theory is elegantly explained, especially
                when combined with sluggish blood flow, which he beautifully describes as originating from suppressed
                menstruation. Combined with plethoric stagnation, V. S. can actually be helpful. When plethory is
                combined with slow blood flow, V. S. can be prescribed several times. This shows that the difference in
                the various forms of plethory and the varying effects of venesection should be considered. However, I
                have not found any precise histories regarding these circumstances.

                <h3>§. 35.</h3>
                I will briefly summarize the main points of my writing. The doctrine of revulsion and derivation is
                based on obscure and vague ideas, primarily from Galen, and was sustained by the reverence for
                antiquity, which led to the fact that doctors, although forced by Harvey to recognize that Galen's
                doctrine needed to be revised, could not reject it. The terms remained, and there has always been some
                D. & R. doctrine, even though it was altered in various forms by different people. I believe it is
                possible to overturn the entire doctrine of R. & D. in four ways. First, the fundamental premise of the
                doctrine, I deny that the resistance in the artery from which the blood is drawn is diminished when the
                vein is cut. Furthermore, even if this were true, the consequences would be something completely
                different than what is commonly said. Thirdly, even if both are granted, namely the reduction of
                resistance and the effects attributed to it, they would still destroy each other: the effects of
                venesection and its occlusion. Finally, the various theories of the authors, supported by their
                experimental recollections, contradict each other.

                Therefore, of the three uses of V. S., which are mentioned—evacuation, derivation, revulsion—I only
                consider the first, namely evacuation, to be correct. By performing a V. S., all the beneficial effects
                that come with a significant release can be achieved. However, I leave revulsion solely to Senac, who
                rightly deserves this term, as I mentioned earlier. Regarding this, Senac says: "Revulsion, which is
                usually referred to, consists of diverting the blood from certain arteries; but the revulsion I speak of
                is one where, when a bloodletting is performed, the blood that overflows certain arterial vessels leaves
                these vessels via the same path by which it entered, meaning it returns on its own tracks." But this
                form of revulsion is rarely given and only occurs in a place that is the only one affected; it never
                happens in the internal organs. Local scarifications of the affected areas seem to help promote this
                form of revulsion.

                <h3>§. 37.</h3>
                When I intended to examine the entire scope of the doctrine of revulsion and derivation and evaluate the
                effects of those methods, which are commonly considered alternatives to V. S., such as other methods of
                bloodletting, purging, artificial ulcers, epispastic agents, etc., I was persuaded to abandon this plan
                due to both the lengthy work and the scope of academic writing and the conviction that those I could
                prove that no D. or R. could be achieved by V. S. would not hesitate to disagree universally.
                <br>
                <br>However, I will briefly indicate which methods I believe are the most effective among the remaining
                revulsive and derivatory remedies.
                <br>
                <br>The incision of the artery that supplies blood to the affected area produces the so-called revulsion
                mentioned in the preceding §, but it will be minor if other arteries also supply their blood to the same
                place. Moreover, from arteriotomy one can expect a quicker evacuation, but not great effects; and it
                seems to me that one cannot expect major results based on the considerable relief observed in nasal
                hemorrhages that are not caused by vessel fragility. Such nasal bleeding in acute diseases indicates the
                strength of the disease, the strength of the heart, and the abundance of blood — all in great degree —
                and thus an immense plethora. It is therefore certain that the beneficial effects of such nasal
                hemorrhage arise because the plethora is reduced, and not necessarily because arterial blood is
                released, or because it flows from the nose — the latter being doubtful. The same nature, or rather the
                complex of causes acting in acute illnesses, is said to give rise to nasal bleeding out of mechanical
                necessity; likewise, in others, hemorrhoidal bleeding or bleeding from any other site with the least
                resistance occurs, also bringing relief. A slow dripping of blood — a sad omen according to Hippocrates
                — indicates, along with stronger flows, the excessive firmness of vessels unwilling to yield, suggesting
                that necessary medical intervention has been neglected.
                <br>
                <br>The beneficial effects of nasal hemorrhages and all hemorrhoidal bleedings in healthy individuals
                arise from the reduction of plethora, just as the health benefits of menstrual flow in women. These
                hemorrhages are often also periodic. It is wise not to hinder the pathways that the blood seeks out for
                itself, nor to intervene with other treatments unless necessity compels, because such bodies are
                naturally suited to restoring plethora; moreover, the vessels that typically discharge the blood may
                lose their ability if their function is repeatedly interrupted, perhaps by hardening, which would
                destroy the natural measure of blood volume and disturb the body's balance and order.

                <br>Purgatives act by reducing the total mass of fluids and by drawing out a specific part of the
                humors. Artificial ulcers and setons stimulate to some extent, but mainly benefit by removing a specific
                portion of bodily fluids.
                <br>
                <br>Epispastic remedies (counter-irritants) act by stimulation. My theory of inflammation is as follows:
                the nerves either of the heart itself or of any other organ where inflammation begins are irritated by
                some cause, including the nerves leading to the arterial tunics; thus, these arteries propel their blood
                more vigorously, and the pulse sometimes becomes perceptible where previously it was not. This results
                in a localized inflammation without fever, unless the stimulus is excessive, which, if it affects the
                heart itself or involves the cardiac nerves in sympathy, produces fever. Therefore, epispastics seem to
                act by a stimulus opposed to the cause producing inflammation. Certainly, in convulsive diseases caused
                by irritation of the nervous system, such as epilepsy and hysteria, stimulants are beneficial. In
                soporous states, epispastics are useful because they rouse the patient from lethargy, which often cannot
                be dispelled by other remedies. In phrenitis (inflammatory madness), epispastics have both effects
                described above.
                <br>
                <br>In general, all those remedies commonly referred to as revulsive or derivative do not truly deserve
                these names, according to the original proponents of the theory of revulsion and derivation through
                bloodletting.

                I conclude ( 130 ) with some verses borrowed from the illustrious Triller, the writer of Æsop’s charming
                fables:
                <br>
                <br>There remains much for me to write,
                <br>but I deliberately refrain:
                <br>First, so as not to seem burdensome to you,
                <br>who are already occupied with a multitude of matters;
                <br>then, in case someone else wishes to attempt the same,
                <br>so that there remains some material for him to work upon.
                <br>Although there is an abundance of material,
                <br>often it is the craftsman who is lacking,
                <br>not the work.I ask you to grant me a reward for my brevity.
                <br>
                <br>Indeed, I seek and hope for a reward for my sincerity from fair and discerning readers. Even if I do
                not fully convince them of my views, if I can at least demonstrate my spirit devoted to truth, I shall
                consider myself amply compensated by this joy, despite whatever trouble harsher and more irritable
                judgments of others might create.

                <h2>
                    To the most illustrious and most learned
                    <br> author of the dissertation
                    <br> the president [sends his greetings].

                </h2>
                I found nothing, most illustrious candidate, that needed changing in your dissertation; but I did find
                ample reason for congratulations. You completed your medical studies not merely by a simple grasp of
                doctrines but also by examining points where doubts existed, especially where further inquiry seemed
                necessary. Likewise, your venerable father deserves congratulations, having increased the number of his
                sons who serve the public excellently — with hope soon of adding a fourth, and with the rare fortune
                that none among them lacks rewarded virtue and diligence.
                <br>
                <br> No truer or greater joy can I conceive.
                <br>
                <br> However, you should not think, because I changed nothing in your dissertation, that I agree with
                you entirely. Nor do I directly disagree; rather, I believe further deliberation is needed. Meanwhile,
                following the precept of my former teacher Descartes, it is safest to adhere to common opinion where
                there is no danger.
                <br>
                <br> I, too, consider hydraulics the starting point of investigation — but not the hydraulics describing
                liquid flow under constant force through pipes, like the pressure in a large vessel. In that case,
                although diversion can occur, it requires conditions hardly imaginable in the human body. The heart does
                not act with constant force but imparts impulses with each contraction, and the impulse seems greater
                when nearly emptied than when full.
                <br>
                <br> Thus, if we compare blood motion depending on the heart to fluid movement driven by gravity, we
                must imagine a vessel of medium capacity gradually emptying through a hole. If we open another hole, the
                diversion increases proportionally — a fact easy to reason and verify experimentally.
                <br>
                <br> We must not ignore the arteries' elasticity, influencing blood movement as would the blood’s own
                elasticity within rigid pipes. Yet, as motion through elastic bodies propagates differently than through
                inert ones, fluid movement driven by periodic heartbeats would differ between elastic and non-elastic
                conditions.
                <br>
                <br> Finally, let us not forget: We are dealing with a living, animated body, not a dead one. Blood
                movement is determined not solely by heart force and artery diameters but largely by nerve actions that
                vary rapidly and unpredictably.
                <br>
                <br> When combining these reflections with empirical knowledge about venesection choices in diseases —
                faithfully reported by trustworthy authors — it is, in my judgment, possible to establish with great
                probability, if not full certainty, an a priori confirmation or refutation.
                <br>
                <br> This, most learned candidate, I expect from your learning and insight. Meanwhile, I commend myself
                to your kind memory and wish all good and fortunate things to you, your most honorable parents, and your
                brothers.
                <br>
                <br> Farewell. Given on the 7th of October 1749.

                If I am the author of salutary health, born, as it is said, from Aesculapius, the father, and from
                certain Temperance, the mother, and if Hygeia, always with her healing light, has looked upon me, and
                Soemmerring, whom she once fashioned with her own hand in her sacred cave and nurtured in gracious arts,
                may divine providence protect against the frailty of illness, wherever the delicate body languishes, or
                the frail Muse fades, and may it grant firmer stamina to my father-in-law and Soemmerring's father.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, the goddess, in shining honors, lifts you, rewarding your diligent efforts with a laurel
                crown.
                <br>
                <br>It was indeed so worthwhile to persist in the relentless concerns of daily time and the pleasant
                hours of the learned light; it was so worthwhile to irrigate the face with the abundant streams of the
                Pegasian fountains, to have flown to the heights where the pestilent night of ignorance fled from
                knowledge.
                <br>
                <br>Behold, the goddess herself, moving with heavy steps, reaches the great choir of sons, who honor her
                with high esteem; Georgia claims with justice that she is the one who commands those responding to her
                labor to offer not a small reward of glory.
                <br>
                <br>Therefore, he to whom the Greek Muse and Anson have presented hidden words from the storehouse of
                disciplines, Richter begins: if there is any use or honor, it is in medicine — immense both in use and
                honor. The recent light of modern times has rekindled the wisdom of earlier ages. To him, no doctrine of
                learning, not even that from the closed Attic archives, will remain hidden, whether it was born from the
                mind of old Coi, or from the eloquence of Eresius, or from the profound teachings of Galen, or from the
                sage whom Stagira gave.
                <br>
                <br>Then Apollo, the greatest of both virtues, who soothes weary bodies with song and calms weary hearts
                with his melodies, Hallerus, he unfolded his speech in these ways:
                <br>
                <br>What wonderous creator of things, who, with an incomprehensible mind, shaped the gift of life, in
                whose unity the limbs correspond, and the heart beats without ceasing, with a spirit that circulates
                through every machine, and whose vital essence flows with the movement of liquid? Whose earlier signs
                declared the way—unless Servetus had obscured this flame of glory? The life of plants, the abundant
                blessings that nature gives, whether it be to the Bructeri or the Alpine peaks, now unlocked for foreign
                nations, our cure and wealth!
                <br>
                <br>Oederus, with a heart full of wisdom, entrusted this task. How great the praise owed to him, for his
                mind, sharpened by the language of the Latins, revealed the subtlety of concepts in the science of
                poisons and pestilence!
                <br>
                <br>From that point, Segnerus, a giant in the arts of Euclid and in the study of the heavens, the earth,
                and the sea, praises the noble pursuits of the following scholars, whether they free themselves by
                daring to explore the path of distant stars or whether they track the footsteps of nature's secrets
                through the blind earth, seeking the hidden powers of things, mastering the fiery knowledge of the
                Hermetics.
                <br>
                <br>At last, Brendel’s gentle kindness, whose insightful mind always foresees the fate of the sick, like
                the twin Castor, who never denies a true promise, brings relief to the heavy limbs and soothes with
                herbs or by care, or softly comforts with sweet words.
                <br>
                <br>The goddess hears and smiles upon hearing the men. She no longer hesitates to bestow her immortal
                kiss, nor to offer gold, rings, or the honor of a crown. She exclaims three times, "Happily! Happily!"
                and the whole choir echoes, "Happily!" Apollo stands by, nodding, his hair shaking from the dew of
                fragrant odors, a happy buzz from the hissing serpents.
                <br>
                <br>But retroactively, the envy is struck underfoot, as the voice of the brother, full of gratitude,
                mocks, while learned faces echo in harmony.
                <br>
                <br>And you, brother, adorned with your laurels, may the gods lead you through a prosperous course.
                Soon, the Seine will compete in glory with you, and the nymphs, forgotten in their playful games, will
                be stunned by the regal strength of Frederick’s moles. Here, you, enriched with new knowledge, which
                grows, nourishes, beautifies, and incites, in the high city, your cohort will outshine others. How much
                more you will surpass the wretched herds of the past, the deadly pestilence, and the pale forms of
                fever, while fate itself reverses the days! How much you will elevate the name of your homeland and your
                legacy!
                <br>

                GÖTTINGEN,
                <br>at Abraham Vandenhoeck, academic printer.

                <h3>§. 1.</h3>
                Whether Cyprian’s maxim holds true here — that, as he said, wine drinkers suffer from stones far more
                often than beer drinkers — it is certain that our Göttingen enjoys the rare good fortune that bladder
                stones are among the rarest diseases here. We have dissected 230 human cadavers in our theatre, of
                various ages and both sexes, nearly all of humble condition, as is easily apparent. Among this number,
                only two cases of calculi in the urinary passages occurred. One was a large, somewhat rough and angular
                stone, resembling a sandy rock, impacted in the pelvis of a boy, with the kidney otherwise fairly
                intact. The other, a tiny stone smaller than a pea, was lodged in the ureter of an infant, almost
                entirely obstructing the passage so that it appeared contracted into the form of a thread beneath the
                stone. I may also add a stone from a horse, expelled from the intestine and gifted to us, formed around
                an iron nail — similar to the cases recorded by the excellent observer Antonius Vallisnerius —
                kidney-shaped, very heavy, and closely resembling a natural stone.

                <h3>§. 2.</h3>
                Far more frequent among us, however, are gallbladder stones — a disease little known to the ancients,
                but which either rages more frequently or at least is observed more abundantly in our regions, so that,
                if remedies have been devised to crush bladder stones, it seems even more necessary to find some cure
                against the much more common gallstones. For gallstones cause suffering in a similar way and ultimately
                lead just as much to death, although they require surgical operation far less often, and only when the
                ulcerated gallbladder has adhered to the peritoneum — a condition which is universally acknowledged to
                be extremely rare.

            <section id="chap42">
                <h3>§. 3.</h3>
                To demonstrate the frequency of gallstones, I will present some examples that occurred in the anatomical
                theatre. Thus, in 1742, in a woman whose stomach was greatly contracted around the pylorus, we found the
                gallbladder entirely white, empty, and almost without any trace of bile. Inside were two white, chalky,
                smooth stones, about the size of a hazelnut, intensely green under their outer layer, although this
                greenness had faded into a yellowish color. Each stone was enclosed in its own sort of capsule, as the
                gallbladder around the stone at the fundus had contracted to form a cell that held the stone quite
                firmly. The stones were so soft that they spontaneously disintegrated. The patient did not suffer from
                jaundice. It is worth noting that certain invisible insects had feasted on the stones, creating angular
                paths and furrows on the outer chalky surface and boring tunnels through the yellow part inside. When
                placed in a flame, like other stones, they crackled, burned, and, upon melting, released small droplets.

                <br><br>

                <h3>§. 4.</h3>
                In the year 1743, a woman, manifestly jaundiced, was brought to the theater, so that even the abdominal
                water, produced by condensed vapor, possessed staining power. The omentum had hardened into a fleshy
                appearance; the liver was diseased and ulcerated; there was scarcely any blood in the vessels. In the
                gallbladder, fifteen stones were found, four of which were large, larger than a hazelnut, and the rest
                small, all angular with some resemblance to a cube. The stone nearest to the cystic duct was extended
                into the duct with a sort of beak. The remaining bile was scanty, slightly bitter, and slightly yellow.
                The stones were black, smooth, and burned in the flame like wax. After the removal of the outer, thin,
                black crust, a bilious yellow color appeared underneath.

                <h3>§. 5.</h3>
                In March 1745, the body of a hypochondriac who had declined into idiocy was brought in, having died of a
                splenic disease and cold. In this otherwise entirely intact body, the liver was enlarged, with a
                distinct extension towards the spleen. In the gallbladder, the bile was scarcely bitter, and there was a
                gallstone nearly filling the entire bladder, exquisitely shaped like an olive. It was beautifully
                variegated in shades of dark brown and lighter brown, such that both ends (poles) were yellow, and a
                yellow ellipse stretched along the middle length. The remainder of the stone was of a richer color and
                marked with chestnut-brown circles. It was light and somewhat velvety in texture, and because of its
                beauty, I did not break it.

                In the case of an infanticide in January 1747, the gallbladder was long, narrow, and nearly empty; the
                small amount of bile remaining was yellow, pale, and scarcely bitter. Within the gallbladder was a stone
                shaped like a mulberry, round and covered all over with small bumps, somewhat black, but showing a faint
                yellow color when dried; it was small. It shared with others the trait that this external blackness
                would gradually wear off.

                In a woman who drowned in April of the same year, the gallbladder was filled with gallstones, scarcely
                countable in number. One stone had a somewhat blunted cube shape, another was more triangular, and many
                were small and angular. The outer layer was white, and there was a second green covering.

                In January 1748, we dissected a hanged woman who had appeared perfectly healthy. The intestines, as is
                common in cases of strangulation, were very red. In the gallbladder, there were eleven gallstones: one
                in the common bile duct (choledochus), three at the entrance to the cystic duct, all shaped like
                mulberries, composed of many small segments, nearly round, sparkling like crystals and semi-transparent.
                When one of them spontaneously broke open, the inner structure became visible: a dark outer layer and an
                inner substance glittering like selenite, radiating outward from a yellow center towards the shell,
                forming crusts and thin layers. The remaining smaller stones were clustered together, white, round,
                mulberry-like, and similarly layered inside like selenite, shining. There was little bile, greenish and
                hardly bitter.

                <br><br>
                <i> b) b) Such crystalline stones appear to have been the ones mentioned by HENRI CUS ALBERTUS NICOLAI
                    in his observation V, and which G. FABRICIUS HILDANUS previously referred to in his observation from
                    the 23rd century, VI.

                There was another woman, who indeed still survives, but to whom a spontaneously occurring ulcer in the
                epigastrium with pus and constant gallstones appeared, almost as described in PETIT's history. I note
                some of them as angular and triangular due to the rarity of the example, and they also promote flames,
                in a way similar to sealing wax.

                <h3>§. 10.</h3>
                I may add the example of a man, who was sufficiently known here in Göttingen for his expertise in law.
                After an acute fever, he suffered from various and long-lasting liver ailments, yellow jaundice,
                inflammatory fever, persistent vomiting, black jaundice, and pressure in the chest area. Death followed
                after pressure in the heart's cavity. The gallbladder was entirely consumed, and in the midst of putrid
                decay, a stone was found, which I now see before me, perfectly oval, wood-colored, solid, moderately
                rough, shaped to the exact size of the gallbladder, and longer than its own length. A large part of the
                liver had rotted.

                <h3>§. 11.</h3>
                We have compared ox gallstones with human ones. These we obtain from the gallbladder and ducts, and some
                of them are tubular, mucous, and resemble the shapes of the ducts themselves, deep yellow in color. From
                the gallbladder, we have found lighter, almost human-like stones, irregular, black, with a crust that
                contains a black, fissile, shining substance inside, similar to the description in §. VIII.

                <br>
                <br>It appears that this is a common fatal disease, which has been most prevalent among adults, as
                evidenced by the true signs we find in cadavers. Children and young people, as far as we know, are never
                affected. Jaundice is sometimes present but is generally absent, as our experiments show. Frequently,
                the stones are so large that there is no hope of them passing through the common bile duct, as confirmed
                in histories X and XV. The shape of the stones is uncertain, with the same descriptions indicating some
                that are angular and cubic, others similar to olives, or spherical or oblong cylindrical, as confirmed
                in histories VIII and I. Other stones show nothing but a globular, almost calcareous structure, while
                others show elegant rays of successive deposits. We have observed flammable stones. The bile with the
                stone is always exhausted and without proper bitterness, sometimes almost none. Often, there are no
                associated liver defects with the stone, and no jaundice. In one case, there was attachment of the stone
                to the gallbladder, while in the other cases, the gallbladders were intact and solid. I have not
                observed dilation of the common bile duct or cystic duct, as seen by Caietanus Taconus and other men.
                <br>
                <i> <br>c) There are also non-inflammable stones, which are well-known and confirmed by experiments of
                    the
                    esteemed MAN I. B. MORGAGNI in his work Adversaria Anatomica III, Epistola Anatomica III. However,
                    our
                    stones are not only black but also white, chalky, selenitic, transparent, and crystalline, and they
                    caught fire.
                    <br>
                    <br>d) It is not always the case that gallstones reattach or that stones cause jaundice, as already
                    observed by LVDOVICES LE VASSEVR, triumvir, in his sylva on page 24, and then by ILL, MORGAGNI in
                    his
                    second work. </i>
                <br><br>Now, I move on to the most distinguished candidate, whose praiseworthy life I will present
                in his
                own words.
                <br>
                <br>Georg Christian Oeder
                <br>of Ansbach
                <br>
                <br>“I revere my father, GEORGIUS LVDOVICUS OEDER, S. Th. D., Bishop of Feuchtwangen in the
                Principality
                of Onoltingen, and my mother, MARGARETHA SIBYLLA HAMBERGER. I was born on February 28, 1728, in
                Ansbach,
                where my father was the rector of the third gymnasium. My excellent parents spared no effort in
                making
                sure that I grew up immersed in the discipline of religion, good morals, and literature. My dear
                father
                took on the labor, but one that was dear to him, of forming my character, teaching me, who owe my
                life
                to him, how to live well, providing me with guidance in knowledge and counsel. I left his museum and
                came to Göttingen around Easter 1746. During that first summer, I studied those disciplines which
                would
                be necessary for anyone wishing to approach the boundaries of medicine. I heard from Exc. GESNER,
                who
                showed me how much he valued the Oeder family, and he introduced me to the fundamentals of solid
                doctrine, while also explaining the New Testament. He continued teaching throughout the winter. I
                also
                attended lectures by other notable men, including those of Exc. SEGNERO, who taught me the elements
                of
                mathematics, both pure and applied, and demonstrated natural philosophy with experimental methods,
                as
                well as teaching algebra. In the next winter, I started studying medicine, attending lectures by
                Illust.
                RICHTER, who taught dietetics, and Illust. HALLER, who demonstrated the human anatomy. I also
                learned
                chemistry and pharmacy from Excell. SEGNERVM and BRENDELIVM, as well as clinical practice. I owe
                much to
                these great names, and I will continue to add to medical science as much as my moderate abilities
                will
                allow.”
                <br>
                <br>Therefore, what is fortunate and successful, the deceased, with the highest dignity and having
                overcome previous dangers, will be presented as the most learned candidate, and with the glorious
                consent of the distinguished Chancellor, we will conduct him tomorrow, October 11th, to the chair,
                where
                after a brief lecture on ‘Stimulus,’ he will engage in a discussion on Derivation and Revulsion by
                venesection under the guidance of the experienced SEGNERI. I request that the esteemed PROREKTOR
                GEORGIA
                AUGUSTA, the illustrious nobles of the Holy Roman Empire, the most renowned professors, and the most
                respected citizens of all classes be most dutifully present to honor this scholarly contest. Given
                on
                the 10th of October 1749, and I have affixed the seal of our faculty.
