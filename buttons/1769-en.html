                    <h3>Preface.
                    </h3>
                    These essays are the result and execution of a commission that was assigned to me shortly after the
                    census lists had arrived, to
                    extract results from these lists; to make reflections upon them; and to present a plan for future
                    censuses that might be undertaken,
                    <br>
                    <br>whereby Essay A belongs to the second, Essay B to the first, and Essay C to the third part of
                    this commission.
                    <br>
                    <br>I submit these essays to the press pursuant to a permission received in the past year, which
                    I—being, in general, a friend only of publicity within proper bounds—deemed all the more necessary,
                    since I did not regard the fruit of such a commission as entirely my literary property.
                    <br>
                    <br>I submit them to print just as they once flowed from my pen, and I hope that they, with all the
                    shortcomings I am well aware of, may nevertheless not be unwelcome to the public both within and
                    beyond the Danish states.
                    <br>
                    <br>Fragments thereof are to be found in the second volume of the Materials for the Statistics of
                    the Danish States, which were published—entirely without my involvement—by benevolent, yet wholly
                    unknown, men through the Kortensche Bookshop in the years 1784 and 1786, as the surprising note in
                    the preface, pages V–VII, attests.
                    <br>
                    <br>Without the knowledge of Prof. Crome, and undoubtedly to his own satisfaction, I cannot here
                    refrain from correcting the errors found in the table on page 42 of his book entitled "Europe’s
                    Products" (Edition 1784), regarding Denmark and Norway.
                    <br>
                    <br>It states there, in the column headed "various data":
                    <br>
                    <br>for Denmark: "808 according to Oeder, 952 according to a newer and more accurate report from
                    Copenhagen",
                    <br>
                    <br>for Norway: "7000. 723, 141 according to a report communicated to me from Kiel in the year
                    1784",.
                    <br>
                    <br>The correction is as follows: The figures 808 and 952 are both my own. The figure 808 is to be
                    understood as referring to Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig dependent thereon; the figure 952
                    includes, in addition to these 808 square miles, also the Duchy of Holstein belonging to the then
                    Royal privative share, together with the then Counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. The figure
                    723,141, which as an area makes no sense whatsoever, is in fact the number of inhabitants in Norway.

                    <h3>A.</h3>

                    Submitted by order of the Royal Rentekammer in the year 1772.
                    <br>
                    <br>After long and laborious processing of the lists that were received following the census of the
                    inhabitants of the Royal States in Europe, conducted on the 15th of August 1769, I now find myself
                    in a position to present the results of this census, along with reflections thereon.
                    <br>
                    <br>I also provide an expanded plan for such censuses, which ought rightly to be repeated from time
                    to time, for only the comparison of the results of various censuses becomes truly instructive.
                    <br>
                    <br>With this, I thus fulfill the commission that was granted to me by Supreme Royal command from
                    the Royal Rentekammer on the 18th of April 1770. I have undertaken more than this commission
                    strictly required, namely also a comparison of the annual changes in the human population with the
                    total number of people living at a given time, through which comparison rules may also be
                    established by which one can deduce the total from the annual changes; and to this end I have caused
                    extracts to be made from the church registers for the ten years from 1760 to 1769. But as the
                    processing of these still requires some time, I did not wish to delay the part that was properly
                    assigned to me, and the results and conclusions from the extracts of the church registers may, after
                    some time, follow as an addition to the main matter.
                    <br>
                    <br>I hope that the extensive labour hidden within the appended tables—especially in the many
                    calculations undertaken to indicate, everywhere, the necessary scale for comparisons—will not go
                    unrecognized, and I flatter myself that in this manner I have fulfilled my commission to the highest
                    satisfaction.
                    <br>
                    <br>The reflections upon the census conducted on the 15th of August 1769 are, according to the
                    method of the schema employed therein, divided into the following sections:
                    <br>
                    <br>I. Reflections on the number of inhabitants in itself, and in general, without reference to
                    particular circumstances.
                    <br>
                    <br>II. Reflections prompted by the comparison of the number of inhabitants with the space they
                    occupy, or the area of the countries; as well as reflections arising from the comparison of the
                    number of inhabitants with the state's revenues.
                    <br>
                    <br>III. Reflections on the comparison between the population of the towns and that of the
                    countryside.
                    <br>
                    <br>IV. Reflections on the ratio of the two sexes to each other.
                    <br>
                    <br>V. Reflections on the proportion of people in each of the seven stages of life, as adopted in
                    the census schema.
                    <br>
                    <br>VI. Reflections on the ratio between the married and the unmarried.
                    <br>
                    <br>VII. Reflections on the classes according to their means of livelihood.
                    <br>
                    <br>VIII. Reflections upon a closer comparison of the productive members of the citizenry, the
                    peasantry, and maritime occupations, with the consuming servants of the King and the State in both
                    ecclesiastical and civil estates, and with the indigent.
                    <br>
                    <br>Finally, follow:
                    <br>
                    <br>IX. some remarks on the schema used and the method employed in the operation.

                    <h3>First Section.</h3>
                    Reflections on the number of inhabitants in itself and in general, without reference to particular
                    circumstances. Table 1.
                    <br>
                    <br>Native and foreign writers usually estimate the presumed number of inhabitants of the Royal
                    Danish States in Europe at 2½ million. It is here as it so often is with offhand estimations:
                    countries and cities are thought to be more populous, and people reputed to be wealthy are believed
                    to be richer, than later proves to be the case upon actual enumeration. From this arises the
                    necessity of proper censuses.
                    <br>
                    <br>Since many Royal subjects are constantly at sea, and the census was conducted in the middle of
                    summer, there is reason to believe that many who were absent at precisely that time were not
                    counted; and this supposition is made even more plausible by the considerable excess of females over
                    males, since those absent are, for the most part, of the male sex.
                    <br>
                    <br>At the same time, we are not certain that here and there some individuals may not have been
                    counted twice.
                    <br>
                    <br>If we allow for those absent at the time of the census, and for the armed forces not listed in
                    the census rolls, a total addition of 83,000 persons in both categories to bring the number to
                    2,100,000, we are, without doubt, reckoning generously.
                    <br>
                    <br>A population of 2,100,000 souls does not, to be sure, make one of the great states among the
                    European nations; yet neither we subjects nor our Most Gracious King should take this as a
                    misfortune. The subjects of the great states, in whose histories a fifty-year peace is something
                    unheard of, are not therefore happier for being members of a vast and boundless body politic; and
                    for a friend of mankind upon the throne, the vocation of rendering 2,100,000 human beings as happy
                    as possible is great and exalted enough.
                    <br>
                    <br>These reflections should serve to remind our statesmen never to lose sight of the rule Horace
                    prescribes to poets who undertake an epic: "Versate diu, quid ferre recusent, quid valeant humeri" —
                    Consider long what shoulders can bear, and what they must refuse — so that they shape their plans
                    carefully in accordance with the needs which nature permits to be fulfilled, and with the strengths
                    which nature has allotted to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>A number of 2,100,000 persons always deserves the name of a nation, and as a nation it ought
                    rightfully to be equal to the world at large, within its own home. This security, both external and
                    internal — which is the first and primary aim of civil life — this dependable state, which does not
                    rest upon the world’s friendship or the turns of worldly fortune, but upon the inherent strength of
                    the state itself, is the basis of all other well-being. Nature, which has fortified Norway with a
                    wall of rock, and which has connected the Danish peninsula to the great solid German mainland by
                    means of a not very broad isthmus between Travemünde and Hamburg, aids us in this regard. But we
                    must remain vigilant in the defence of this our vulnerable flank, and remember the years 1629, 1658,
                    and 1762. Without this connection to the continent, Denmark would be wholly a sea power, like Great
                    Britain; and even with this connection, sea power must remain our chief strength — without, however,
                    neglecting our security on the landward side. And since we cannot, alongside the required naval
                    force, maintain a standing land force as large as would be necessary, the necessity becomes evident
                    of forming a viable national force, which may readily be drawn forth from the bosom of a nation
                    numbering 2 million.
                    <br>
                    <br>The Danish state has had its borders, in terms of territory, assigned by nature; and unless I am
                    greatly mistaken, even the possession of the lost provinces beyond the Sound would only give the
                    state an additional weak flank. But within the present borders—how much remains to be done, how many
                    significant peaceful conquests are still possible? A fertile soil, disadvantageously distributed
                    among its cultivators; chains still borne by the estate that makes up three-quarters of the nation;
                    a large and wholly neglected province such as Iceland; the most advantageous location at sea, and
                    the vocation imposed by nature in that location; urban industry, still in its infancy, and whose
                    expansion — from the ratio 13:100 to 43:100 — that is, a tripling — is entirely feasible! What
                    prospects do we not see here for an expanded population — an expansion all the more desirable,
                    since, according to a well-established principle of political economy, a state’s strength must be
                    measured not only by the number of its inhabitants, but also in relation to the territory they
                    occupy, in inverse proportion to the extent of that territory!
                    <br>
                    <br>Sweden had, according to the census taken in 1757, 2,317,599 souls across approximately 5,000
                    Swedish, or 10,368 geographical, square miles.
                    <br>
                    <br>France, according to Vauban in the Dixme royale, had 19,094,000 people; but according to the
                    newer author of L’intérêt de la France mal entendus, only 17 million.
                    <br>

                    Reflections prompted by the comparison of the number of inhabitants with the area they occupy.
                    Tables II–XIV; also reflections arising from comparing the number of inhabitants with the state’s
                    revenues.
                    <br>
                    <br>In order to judge the population of countries, one must have precise notions of their
                    geographical extent or area, and be able to state how many people fall within a given unit of
                    surface — for example, per square geographical mile (15 geographical miles to one degree of the
                    equator). These figures, which express the number of inhabitants per common surface measure, thus
                    show the ratio of population density in the various countries to be compared. And only after such
                    ratios have been determined can one inquire into the causes of these differences in population —
                    causes to be sought in the varying fertility of the soil, the yield from land and water, the
                    climate, the location, the industries, the diligence of the inhabitants, the domestic political
                    constitution of the countries, and the vicissitudes of world events.
                    <br>
                    <br>Even before I received the present commission from the Royal Rentekammer, I had happened upon a
                    method of investigating the area of countries that is as simple as it is little known; and about two
                    and a half years ago, His Majesty received a determination of the area of Denmark, the duchies, and
                    the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, carried out down to each individual district (Harde).
                    <br>
                    <br>More recently, I have extended these investigations to the entire globe, and intend shortly to
                    present the results of these inquiries to His Majesty in all due humility.
                    <br>
                    <br>If I set aside the measurements of Tempelmann — which are eagerly recopied in geographies and
                    other collections of curiosities, but are nonetheless superficial and summary — then these
                    investigations of mine are entirely new, and as little known among foreigners as they are among
                    ourselves.
                    <br>
                    <br>Once the area has been thus determined, the next matter is to have reliable information
                    concerning the number of inhabitants — such information, however, is rarely available for other
                    countries. In order to compare our own lands with others, at least to some extent, I will therefore
                    begin by assembling and presenting the few pieces of information I have been able to gather,
                    including calculations of the number of people per square mile. I shall also provide the area for
                    some countries whose population figures are unknown.

                    Now, after these conducted comparisons — both among our own domestic population between province and
                    province, as well as between our domestic population and that of foreign European countries — should
                    one wish to attentively engage in reflections thereupon, such a multitude of considerations present
                    themselves that I, not being called to write an entire book, must limit myself to but a few.
                    <br>
                    <br>I have always, insofar as I could judge based merely on outward observation during my travels,
                    held the opinion that Denmark, in so far as it consists of islands, is more densely inhabited than
                    Schleswig; Schleswig more so than Holstein — and this now proves to be true. One of the causes,
                    according to my further belief, is this: regarding the parts of these lands made up of noble
                    estates, in Denmark 7/8 or 5/6 of the area of an estate is occupied by peasant farms, whereas in the
                    duchies it is only half, if that. The subdivision of the royal domains in the duchies already
                    contributes somewhat to their further population.

                    <br>One should not fail to note the pronounced population of the counties of Oldenburg and
                    Delmenhorst, as well as the islands of Fehmarn, Als, and Ærø, nor the superiority of the Oldenburg
                    marshland over that of Holstein and Schleswig — likely because in the former more land is kept under
                    the plough, whereas in the latter more is left for grazing. And in Zealand, Amager, and Sokkelund
                    Herred, one may observe the influence of proximity to a great city.
                    <br>
                    <br>Whence comes the exceptionally high population of Ring Herred in Aarhus Diocese (3246)?
                    <br>
                    <br>In Norway. The Nordland provinces — such a vast region (2082 square miles), with its expansive,
                    fish-rich coast, and where the land, at least in the case of the bailiwicks of Helgeland and Salten,
                    is no worse than other coastal valleys in the dioceses of Trondheim and Bergen — have only 26 people
                    per square mile. And yet prejudice and monopolies must eternally carry more weight than sound
                    reason, which, at the very first glance at the map, declares that there ought to be a town in
                    Nordland!
                    <br>
                    <br>And Iceland (which ought still to be for us what Newfoundland once was for all of Europe, before
                    the Grand Banks were frequented, and which in the year 1615 was visited by 120 English ships in a
                    single summer) — Iceland (2904 square miles) has only 16 people per square mile; and Finnmark (1244
                    square miles) has merely 5 — even though it was undoubtedly more populous in ancient times and had
                    12 now-vanished parishes! Fruits of monopoly trade!
                    <br>
                    <br>I cannot refrain from making another remark about Iceland; for such a vast province ought
                    rightly one day to become what it has the potential to be: more valuable to the state. Iceland has
                    46,201 inhabitants, Nordland 53,500 — admittedly 16% more; but just compare the trade of Nordland,
                    conducted as it is despite all the oppression this province endures, with that of Iceland! What are
                    23 or 24 shiploads — admittedly sizable vessels, as the Icelandic Company’s ships are — when
                    compared to 300 cargoes carried by Nordland sloops, vessels which can also bear much? And upon this
                    meagre quantity of bulky exports, amounting to no more than 24 shiploads, rests the entire welfare
                    of the Icelandic nation! Poor people!
                    <br>
                    <br>Let one compare the population of the coastal bailiwicks in the dioceses of Christianssand,
                    Bergen, and Drontheim with those further inland in the same dioceses, as well as with the similar
                    bailiwicks of the diocese of Aggershus (the grain-rich bailiwicks of this diocese must be set aside
                    in this consideration), in order to recognize the advantages and importance of the fisheries.
                    <br>
                    <br>They constitute by far the most important branch of industry in this kingdom, and trade in
                    fishery products is, in particular, the most stable — precisely because these products cannot be
                    stored in warehouses, but the necessity of procuring them renews itself each year. Thus, foreign
                    nations do not have the same power to dictate prices as they do with respect to other Norwegian
                    products — metals, and especially timber.

                    <h3>Comparison with Foreign States</h3>

                    If we choose only to compare ourselves with those European states that are commonly reputed to be
                    modestly or even poorly populated, then certainly the figure of 1305 — the average population per
                    square mile in the Kingdom of Denmark and the German provinces combined — appears fairly reasonable.
                    But when we look to other states where more developed industry prevails, we are undoubtedly far
                    behind. We must strive to catch up with these more flourishing nations, just as anyone seeking
                    improvement must not compare himself with those behind him, but with those ahead. This we must do —
                    and this we can do.
                    <br>
                    <br>We must do it; for (what use is flattery?) we make up, as said, with our 2,100,000 heads only a
                    rather moderate state; and on the German side, nature, as also mentioned, has set a boundary for us
                    — we must therefore seek the enlargement of the state internally. And we can do this. For although
                    it is true that northern lands can never, under otherwise equal circumstances, match southern lands
                    in population — for the simple reason that the inhabitants of northern countries require more fuel,
                    and all forms of fuel (except for coal, which comes from underground) — even peat, which requires
                    less than wood, but still a notable portion of land to produce — consume part of the national area,
                    we nevertheless must not neglect the benefits kindly nature has bestowed upon us: land that,
                    throughout the Kingdom of Denmark and the German provinces, is entirely cultivable and in many and
                    not small places remarkably fertile; and above all, the advantageous maritime location, which
                    delivers foodstuffs for domestic use, facilitates the export of our products, and — even without
                    native goods or commerce in proprietary wares — provides the opportunity to earn by exchanging
                    foreign goods for foreign goods and through freight shipping.
                    <br>
                    <br>We must therefore take Great Britain and Holland as our model, without being discouraged by the
                    vast leap ahead they have taken: for even if we do not reach them in totum, we may still reach them
                    in tantum. But we must also follow the road to wealth which those nations have taken, and follow our
                    calling in the right order. Our calling, our chief occupation, must be first: agriculture and animal
                    husbandry, fisheries and seafaring; manufacturing may follow if it can — that is, to the extent that
                    hands for it are found, which naturally, in a land of fisheries and shipping, will always be fewer
                    than in landlocked countries.
                    <br>
                    <br>Among the means to promote the industry of the subjects, this is the chief: the less direct
                    intervention by government, the more freedom. In particular, I would wish — to promote our natural
                    vocation, the entrepôt trade in the Baltic and to the White Sea, indeed all kinds of trade — a
                    reduction of duties, such that customs duties no longer form a chief part of state revenues, but are
                    rather regarded as a moderation and regulation of commerce. Then, instead of the proposed special
                    free zone for entrepôt trade in Copenhagen, the entire city of Copenhagen could become the staple
                    port of the entrepôt trade.
                    <br>
                    <br>I consider it entirely possible to make up for the loss of customs revenue through increased
                    consumption among all subjects, through a trade tax on those engaged in commerce, and through a levy
                    on the houses and lots of a free port. And the crucial difference — for trade — between these
                    different types of taxes lies in this: that customs duties directly affect goods and influence their
                    prices, thereby impeding their circulation; whereas taxes on consumption, trade, and property allow
                    each person to adapt as best they can — and will gladly do so, when in exchange all goods are freely
                    and unrestrictedly available for enjoyment or speculation, and thus can be more easily passed on in
                    broader trade.
                    <br>
                    <br>Observations in comparing the number of inhabitants with the revenue of the state.
                    <br>
                    <br>To this end, I have drawn up the following table, which I shall explain with but a few remarks.

                    The total population and revenue across all the states has been assumed to be 10,000; that is to
                    say, out of every 10,000 souls — all inhabitants taken together — 3885 are from Denmark, and out of
                    every 10,000 Rixdollars of state revenue, 4589 Rixdollars come from Denmark.
                    <br>
                    <br>In determining the total amount of revenue, I have only considered the local revenues, and
                    excluded all general revenues of the state which cannot be attributed to any particular region or
                    province, such as: postal income, stamp duties, fees, the Sound Toll, the Elsfleth Toll — since,
                    regarding the two latter items, the majority is collected from the subjects of foreign realms, and,
                    regarding the other items, it is difficult to determine how much each part of the royal dominions
                    specifically contributes. The population listed under the items p. q. r. s. is to be understood as
                    the population of the rural areas.
                    <br>
                    <br>This table is altogether too fruitful in considerations regarding the internal strength of the
                    different parts of the state — considerations which must be the foundation of any thorough theory of
                    taxation — for me to presume to exhaust them here; instead, I must limit myself to a few
                    observations that concern Norway.
                    <br>
                    <br>The population of Norway stands in relation to that of Denmark as 3585 to 3885, but the revenue
                    from Norway stands in relation to that from Denmark as 2216 to 4589. If revenues were proportional
                    to population, then, if Denmark yields 4589 Rixdollars, Norway ought to yield 4235 Rixdollars, or 92
                    2/100 Rixdollars for every 100 Rixdollars Denmark contributes. However, Norway in fact yields only
                    48 29/100 Rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now we can rightfully assume — and indeed we must humbly believe — that our forefathers, in
                    regulating tax arrangements, acted as thoughtfully as we ourselves would, according to their best
                    insight and knowledge, and in accordance with the circumstances of their time. Circumstances change
                    constantly in this sublunar world; there is always something to be improved or corrected in our
                    understanding, and knowledge continually expands. Thus, improvements in our tax systems are not only
                    possible but absolutely necessary; we must endeavour to identify every blemish and point where a
                    true improvement is possible — where one of the sources of state revenue may be opened, extended, or
                    purified, where an inequality in the burdens imposed upon the subject may be avoided or rectified.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, we must be very cautious not to fall into sudden and severe deviations from what has
                    been established and become customary, and bear in mind that, just as over time taxes gradually and
                    often imperceptibly — even to the government itself — adjust to the means of livelihood, so too all
                    aspects of common life and the entire economy of the subjects arrange themselves around the system
                    of taxation.
                    <br>
                    <br>Should a tax suddenly be introduced which is not properly suited to the means of livelihood,
                    undesirable consequences will inevitably arise — and that such consequences have arisen from the
                    head tax, especially in Norway, should not surprise us. And I beg, from me — whose intention, God
                    knows, is not to offend — to kindly accept this explanation of why such unpleasant consequences
                    could hardly have been avoided.
                    <br>
                    <br>The head tax is a levy based on the number of inhabitants, but the means of livelihood do not
                    correspond to the number of people. This type of tax may be suitable in a country such as Russia
                    still is — where other taxes are fewer, and particularly where the immovable sources of income,
                    namely land and soil, do not yet have a fixed value that the legislator might base taxes upon. But
                    for the Danish states this tax is not appropriate — precisely because they are more orderly governed
                    than Russia generally still is. And as Russia improves internally, as it inevitably will, the head
                    tax will also become increasingly inappropriate there — though under generally low taxes it may not
                    be burdensome.
                    <br>
                    <br>But with us, it is burdensome — and, caeteris paribus, to the Norwegian more than to the Dane —
                    because the Norwegian, under ordinary taxes (hopefully in proportion to his lesser means of
                    livelihood), is used to paying only half as much as the Dane, but under the head tax is placed on
                    equal footing with the Dane, to whom nature has allotted greater means of earning a living.
                    <br>
                    <br>The difference becomes all the more evident when we consider the peasant in Norway, who in this
                    kingdom constitutes 9/10 of the nation. Their number compares to the rural population in Denmark as
                    3264 : 3180, but the land tax in Norway compares to that in Denmark as 704 : 1881. According to the
                    population, if Denmark contributes 100 Rixdollars in taxes from the land, Norway should contribute
                    102 60/100 Rixdollars, yet in fact it only yields 36 28/100 Rixdollars. If the Norwegian farmer,
                    whose livelihood depends solely on the productivity of the farm he inhabits, and who typically pays
                    only 36 28/100 Rixdollars, is to pay the head tax on the same basis as the Danish farmer, who
                    contributes an average of 100 Rixdollars, then clearly it must weigh disproportionately more heavily
                    on him, relative to his means.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let us add here further relevant reflections: that the government incurs no particular expenses
                    in Norway, and thus a large portion of the revenue it draws from Norway exits the country and is
                    lost to its internal circulation. These funds can return to the hands of the Norwegians – and from
                    there to the hands of the king – only through a profitable trade with other nations. But due to a
                    misfortune (which God in His grace may soon avert), the export of Norwegian goods has in recent
                    years not been able to offset the influx of imports. Hence it becomes understandable how complaints
                    about the extra tax and the lack of money in Norway have grown so extensive.
                    <br>
                    <br>More still: just as the peasantry is numerous in Norway, so the land tax is slight, while the
                    customs duties in Norway are, more than in any other royal land, especially significant, and
                    constitute by far the greatest part of the royal revenue from this realm. Naturally, the best means
                    of livelihood are in the hands of those who pay these duties — namely, in the hands of those
                    involved in trade — that is, the town dwellers, and within those, not the common man, but the
                    merchants and owners of the forests, mines, and all the primary sources of export in this realm.
                    Therefore, a financier must in Norway direct his attention less to the peasant and more to the
                    townspeople; and if he will consider the matter maturely and follow the path I here indicate, he
                    will find an opportunity to achieve something worthwhile.
                    <br>
                    <br>Above all, let us take care not to let ourselves be led — just because Norway, relatively
                    speaking, is not especially productive and does not yield vast sums to the royal treasury — into a
                    contempt for this realm: it provides us with men for the army and the navy!
                    <br>
                    <br>My particular destiny draws me away from the affairs of this kingdom, but never will my
                    appreciation for them be lost, nor my sincere participation in its best hopes — any more than my
                    deep respect for this honourable nation!

                    <h3>Third Section.</h3>

                    Reflections upon comparing the population of towns and rural areas. Tables XV and XVI.
                    <br>
                    <br>Already in the first section, I mentioned that Davenant gives the ratio of urban to rural
                    population in England as 3:4, or the proportion of town inhabitants to the total population as 4,285
                    to 10,000. In the United Netherlands, and especially in the province of Holland, the proportion is
                    certainly even higher — indeed, it is likely that in said province, the number of city and town
                    dwellers, or in other words, those engaged in urban trades, exceeds the number of those in rural
                    areas, i.e., those engaged in agriculture. However, I will set aside the example of Holland
                    entirely, as this state is a very special case which does not nourish its inhabitants through its
                    own native products, but with the products of the entire world — it is almost entirely urban, and in
                    relation to Europe as a whole, it is what a populous city is to a country. But England, which
                    nourishes its people through its own products, can rightfully and justly be presented to us as a
                    model.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now, how far removed is the ratio 333:1000, as found in the small province of Zealand, from the
                    ratio 428:1000 — and that even when we count Copenhagen merely as a Zealandish city, which would
                    indeed be inaccurate, since it is the capital not only of this province, but of both kingdoms and of
                    the entire state! And if we leave out Copenhagen and consider only the remaining towns of the
                    Diocese of Zealand against the rural population of this diocese, how pitiful is the ratio 113:1000?
                    It is thus true and obvious that the industry of the smaller Zealandish towns is swallowed up by
                    Copenhagen; they have, without doubt, all once had more trade and industry, as can be inferred from
                    the many decaying large farmhouses (gaarde) visible in all these towns.
                    <br>
                    <br>As soon as we remove Copenhagen from the equation, how greatly do not all the provinces of the
                    Kingdom of Denmark — even Funen, where the ratio is still 126:1000 — fall behind Schleswig, where,
                    to be sure, there are factories just as well, but admittedly more commercial freedom than in
                    Denmark.
                    <br>
                    <br>Holstein owes its considerable proportion of 254:1000 to the city of Altona; for if we subtract
                    Altona and its 18,050 inhabitants from the total of 34,112 urban residents, the remaining 16,062 in
                    relation to the total population of 134,665 gives only 119:1000.
                    <br>
                    <br>But Norway — which has only 89 townspeople per thousand inhabitants! Norway, which undoubtedly
                    engages in more trade than any other royal province, if we count the turnover of many exported and
                    imported goods as trade. From the very beginning, as long as I have known Norway — and I have now
                    known it for quite some time and had many reasons and opportunities to inquire into its condition —
                    and in many reports I submitted to a few of the foremost men in the ministry during the reign of
                    Frederick V, particularly on the occasion of the proposal to settle colonists in Norway, I have said
                    again and again: If one wants to help Norway, one must not begin with agriculture, but with urban
                    industry. Agriculture in Norway — where there is no poor peasant system as in Denmark to hinder it —
                    has progressed about as far as it can go on its own, under current circumstances, and with little
                    encouragement from the towns. Undoubtedly, it can be developed further; countless areas can be
                    brought under cultivation which are not yet so; undoubtedly, the peasant class can increase in
                    number — and all this will happen if urban trade expands, but not before.
                    <br>
                    <br>Already in 1755 I said: nothing will come of the land-clearing initiative, which was being
                    pursued with great zeal at the time — and experience has shown how right I was. I thought the same
                    of the colonist project in Jutland and Holstein, as I have always been — and still am — convinced
                    that the method of population increase applied in America, in Prussia and Prussian Lithuania under
                    the previous king, and in certain provinces of the Russian Empire under Catherine II, cannot be
                    applied to the Danish states — or to any states at all which are already significantly populated,
                    where the good land is claimed and only the poor remains.
                    <br>
                    <br>The advantages that arise from urban industry for agriculture are: a secure and nearby outlet
                    for all and any agricultural products, which encourages the farmer to produce more and more;
                    likewise, a nearby opportunity to purchase all the necessities the farmer requires on his side; the
                    time saved from such a nearby exchange, and the concentration of diligence and use of time upon the
                    farmer’s proper business — all circumstances, the opposite of which are found in the condition of
                    the farmer in Norway, which has no towns except seaports, and not one of significance beyond
                    Drontheim; none inland, not even along the long route between Drontheim and Christiania, where still
                    in the time of Christian II, the populous town of Hammer stood in Hedemarken.
                    <br>
                    <br>But how is urban trade to be expanded? In no other way than through greater freedom — that
                    better mother, more than mere necessity ever was, of industry, inventiveness, the arts, refinement,
                    emulation, frugality, low prices, and general and particular prosperity. How can industry otherwise
                    flourish in any noticeable way in a state where duties and taxes on goods, decrees and prohibitions,
                    restrictions and observances are so numerous and varied, that an entire code of law could arise from
                    the customs regulations alone; where smuggling has precisely for that reason become the most
                    profitable form of trade; where the monopolism of company trade, exclusive privileges, forced
                    manufactories, and imagined conveniences always favour a small portion of the population at the
                    expense of the many, one province at the cost of one or more others; where the field for speculation
                    for an active merchant is so small and so uncertain, due to the concern that his plans might be
                    upended any day by one regulation or another; where certain considerable provinces, due to their
                    special constitutional status, are in commercial matters practically foreign to the state; where the
                    ambition for titles has corrupted the spirit of commerce, and some of the best-established houses —
                    which by their accumulated wealth could best engage in speculation and trading ventures — are daily
                    lost to commerce, being replaced by beginners without means, and so on.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the Danish states there are 133 townspeople for every thousand inhabitants, that is, 867
                    rural dwellers. Suppose it reached the ratio 428:1000, which according to Davenant is found in
                    England, meaning 572 rural dwellers per thousand: then, if 867/1000 are to become 572/1000, the
                    total population must grow in the ratio 572:867, or as 100:151.5. Thus, from 2,100,000 inhabitants
                    we must reach 3,057,200. Even if we only reached the ratio 200:1000, the total would still grow in
                    the ratio of 800:867 = 100:108, to 2,186,030 — a growth of 169,000 people.

                    <h3>Fourth Section</h3>
                    Considerations on the Ratio Between the Sexes. Tables XVII—XXI.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is much to be regretted that this census was conducted at such an inopportune time of year as
                    mid-summer (August 15), and according to a poorly arranged scheme.
                    <br>
                    <br>In states such as the Danish dominions, a great number of male persons are abroad at that time
                    of year, especially those at sea, but also many who pursue their trade on land abroad — particularly
                    in the County of Oldenburg, many of whom travel to the United Netherlands during the harvest season.
                    The operation should therefore have been conducted in winter, or a special column should have been
                    included in the census schema for those absent — and indeed subdivided: one for those absent abroad,
                    and one for those absent in other royal states. As it stands, I do not know how many men may have
                    been at sea or otherwise abroad at the time, nor whether those males who were not abroad but merely
                    absent from their home district in other royal states — for example, the many Jutlanders and
                    residents of the geest districts in the duchies who travel to the marshes during harvest time — were
                    counted in their home region, at their temporary place of stay, in both, or in neither.
                    <br>
                    <br>Nor do I know the number of men who, being under arms, were omitted from the census — which
                    constitutes another major flaw in the scheme.
                    <br>
                    <br>In this manner, the results of the censuses, and the conclusions that may be drawn from them
                    regarding the matter of the ratio between the sexes, are misleading, and I would therefore prefer to
                    attribute the surplus of 89 females for every 1,000 males to the census having been imprecisely
                    conducted, and to the temporary emigration of male persons, rather than to an actual, absolute
                    shortage of men of such magnitude — and among the causes of this shortage, I would assume some
                    emigrations to be permanent.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is indeed true that there is usually a surplus of females in all countries, even though more
                    boys are born than girls, and this may be due to the nature of men’s occupations, which tax the body
                    more and expose them more frequently to danger; and it is perhaps for this reason that the Ruler of
                    the World ordains more boys to be born than girls. But a surplus of nearly 9 percent is surely too
                    much.
                    <br>
                    <br>And it is, unfortunately, all too true that many men along the coast of Norway, from Jutland,
                    the duchies, the islands, and the western coast, emigrate and are lost forever to the state; and
                    perhaps the head tax is one of the causes. Yet I would not wish to believe that such permanent
                    emigration goes so far as the apparent 9 percent surplus might at first glance suggest.
                    <br>
                    <br>Nevertheless, this apparent imbalance should surely awaken the vigilant attention of the
                    government; for the lack of so many men is a grave harm to the state — both because those who
                    emigrate or are lost to other circumstances belong to the core of the nation and the part upon which
                    economic productivity depends, and because so many women are deprived of husbands, which loss can
                    only, unavoidably, lead to disordered conduct among the remaining women.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this follows one among many unfortunate consequences of the standing army: the unmarried
                    state of so many men well suited to marriage.
                    <br>
                    <br>In particular, the ratio of females to males in Iceland — 1186:1000 — is striking. I also recall
                    a remark previously made by Dr. Hensler in a printed treatise, namely that in Iceland an especially
                    large number of illegitimate children are baptized. The cause of this surplus can hardly be
                    emigration of males, for, to my knowledge, few Icelanders leave the island — except for students,
                    whose small number is irrelevant to the matter. I therefore see no other reason than that many
                    Icelanders likely fall victim to the waves of the sea during fishing expeditions, owing to the
                    poorly equipped state of their seafaring vessels.
                    <br>
                    <br>Also in Norway, the ratio of 1107:1000 is considerable, but is hopefully due only to temporary
                    emigration.
                    <br>
                    <br>When comparing the ratios 1082:1000 in the duchy of Schleswig and 1025:1000 in Holstein, the
                    greater surplus in Schleswig appears to stem from its maritime activity — whereas in Holstein, only
                    Altona engages in seafaring (Itzehoe scarcely deserves mention in this regard), Schleswig, by
                    contrast, has multiple ports on both the North and Baltic Seas, and the islands in the North Sea are
                    filled with sailors. The exceptionally small surplus in Holstein — only 25 per thousand — is
                    presumably due to the fact that this duchy sends many maidservants to Hamburg and Lübeck.
                    <br>
                    <br>That there are comparatively more women in the towns than in the countryside is understandable,
                    since even every modest citizen’s wife keeps a maidservant, and the wealthier often several; also,
                    widows are fond of settling in the small towns. However, I do not believe that the excessively high
                    surplus in Copenhagen — 349 over every thousand men — arises solely from this, but rather because
                    the garrisoned soldiers are not included in the total count of residents of both sexes. But where a
                    nearly equal surplus in Drontheim — 341 — comes from, I cannot comprehend. Indeed, Table XX shows
                    several ratios just as high or even higher, but the total populations in the small towns are too
                    insignificant for the ratios between the sexes to be considered conclusive; a few widows more or
                    less among so small a number of inhabitants immediately causes a fluctuation.
                    <br>
                    <br>In Kongsberg, where the total population is fairly considerable, the number of women falls below
                    parity — only 905 — because the miners cannot easily marry, and in recent years many laborers from
                    surrounding regions were employed in the mines. Since this significantly disadvantaged the proper
                    mining class and deprived them of earnings, the Norwegian chamber during my time arranged for these
                    outsiders to be sent back to their homelands — a decision that, unjustly, was seen by uninformed
                    persons as a sign of the mine’s decline. Measures were also taken to provide work for the wives and
                    daughters of the miners, which — given the generally modest household economy of the miner — they
                    could otherwise hardly find, to the great grievance of household heads.
                    <br>
                    <br>From Table XXI, one sees in general that also in rural districts populated by seafarers, the
                    surplus of females persists. In the hundreds (herreder) belonging to the diocese of Ribe, near
                    Tønder, the lace industry is apparent. But where the excessive surplus in the northern hundred of
                    Langeland — 1532 — stems from, I cannot understand.

                    <h3>Fifth Section</h3>
                    Reflections on the ratio of the number of people in each of the 7 stages of life, as adopted in the
                    census schema. Tables XXI–XXXV.
                    <br>
                    <br>If we were better assured of the correctness and accuracy of the census lists with regard to the
                    stages of human age, and if, generally, these stages were not so extensive, but more precisely
                    delineated — especially the 7th stage, which includes the age from 49 years to life’s utmost limit,
                    and is far too summary and superficial — then such a census could serve to accurately revise the
                    laws by which the Lord of Life brings about changes in the human race, letting one generation arise
                    and another pass away. But as sufficient reliability is lacking, it is not of much use to delve into
                    deeper reflections hereon; however, I shall attempt to draw from the obtained information as much as
                    can reasonably be drawn.
                    <br>
                    <br>Out of every thousand individuals, 202 belong to the first age group, 160 to the second; thus,
                    among every thousand people, 362 are sixteen years old or younger, and the remaining 638 are over 16
                    years of age. If we halve the number of people in the second group and count 80 as aged 9 to 12
                    inclusive, and another 80 as aged 13 to 16 inclusive — which likely is not entirely accurate, and it
                    is more probable that more belong to the 9–12 range than to the 13–16 range — then we find the ratio
                    of children aged 12 and under to the rest of the population to be 282 : 718.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, among 723,141 souls in Norway, where tax liability begins after the 16th year, there are
                    461,363 taxable individuals; and among 1,293,886 souls in the other states, where tax liability
                    begins after the 12th year, there are 929,010 taxable individuals — making a total of 1,390,373
                    taxable persons.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is, however, far from the case that the current extra tax, head tax, percentage tax, and rank
                    tax, all taken together, bring in that much revenue. As this tax is currently levied, it is a
                    completely arbitrary tax, utterly lacking the principle of proportionality, which ought to serve as
                    the foundation for all taxation systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>Of every thousand heads, 202 are to be counted in the first stage of life, and 160 in the
                    second; whence it follows, that under every thousand persons, 362 have not yet attained the
                    sixteenth year, and the remaining 638 have passed beyond it. If, furthermore, we be willing to
                    suppose that the number of persons in the second stage may be evenly divided — namely, 80 for those
                    between the ninth and the twelfth year inclusive, and again 80 for those between the thirteenth and
                    the sixteenth inclusive — though such a distribution may scarcely be exact, and it is rather
                    probable that a greater portion belongs to the younger range, then do we find the proportion of
                    children under the age of twelve to the rest of the population to be as 282 to 718.
                    <br>
                    <br>Accordingly, we have, among the 723,141 souls in Norway, where taxability commences after the
                    sixteenth year, a number of 461,363 liable to the head-tax; and among the 1,293,886 souls in the
                    other Royal States, where liability begins after the twelfth year, 929,010 are reckoned as taxable
                    heads. This makes together 1,390,373 taxable persons.
                    <br>
                    <br>But it is far from the case that the present Extra Tax, the Head Tax, the Percentage Tax, and
                    the Rank Tax, all taken jointly, should yield so considerable a sum. As such tax is at present
                    levied, it must be deemed a wholly arbitrary imposition, entirely devoid of that principle of
                    proportional equity, which ought in all financial systems to be held inviolable.
                    <br>
                    <br>We have 1,737,988 inhabitants residing in the countryside, of whom 838,787 are of the male sex.
                    The males in the third stage of life, that is to say, from the 16th to the 24th year, amount to 63
                    per thousand, and we shall reckon, for those in the latter half thereof — namely from the 21st to
                    the 24th year — 31 per thousand; thus, among 1,737,988 rural inhabitants, we have 53,870 males of
                    the age 21 to 24 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>From the fourth stage, ages 25 to 32, we have 54 males per thousand persons, which yields, among
                    1,737,988 individuals, 93,850 males.
                    <br>
                    <br>From the fifth stage, ages 33 to 40, we find 52 males per thousand, yielding 90,370 males.
                    <br>
                    <br>From the sixth stage, ages 41 to 48, 40 males per thousand are reckoned, which amounts to 69,520
                    males among the said population.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let us now recapitulate:
                    <br>Males aged 21–24 years: – 53,870
                    <br>25–32 years: – 93,850
                    <br>33–40 years: – 90,370
                    <br>41–48 years: – 69,520
                    <br>Sum of all males aged 21–48 years: 307,610
                    <br>and sum of those aged 21–40 years only: 238,090
                    <br>
                    <br>This, then, is our martial manpower, from which we are to draw the crews for our fleet and form
                    our national army. Yet we may still reckon somewhat upon the towns, which always provide a number of
                    recruits, and even more sailors, since the so-called fixed stock of royal sailors in Copenhagen, in
                    a manner, recruits itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>We have 141,443 seamen with their families: according to the ratio 1,737,988 : 307,610, there
                    would be 25,030 seamen aged 21 to 48 among the 141,443; or, by the ratio 1,737,988 : 238,090, there
                    would be 19,376 seamen aged 21 to 40. If now we reckon 3,000 of these 19,376 into service of the
                    royal fleet, alongside and beyond those of the navy present in Copenhagen, I would think we are in a
                    tolerable state of readiness for the usual course of warlike times.
                    <br>
                    <br>From the above 307,610, we must deduct the 25,030 seamen, whereby there remain 282,580; and from
                    238,090, subtracting 19,376, there remain 218,714. Furthermore, deducting 218,714 from 282,580
                    leaves 63,866.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now, if we were to maintain on standing foot 15,000 men of enlisted troops — about 12,000
                    infantry and 3,000 cavalry; and if we drew from the 218,714 a body of 30,000 men, roughly every
                    eighth man, for national regiments destined for field service, from which annually 3,000 would exit
                    and 3,000 enter, so that the obligation endured for ten years; and if we further drew from the
                    63,866 a number of 6,000 men, not even one in ten, for a reserve, like the former landværn, of which
                    yearly 1,200 would exit and the like number enter — so that the obligation lasted five years, thus
                    15 years in total — we should possess 51,000 martial men, and such an army, methinks, could be
                    maintained in serviceable condition for a lesser sum than our present land-military budget consumes.
                    <br>
                    <br>How this army, consisting of 12/17 national and 5/17 enlisted troops, should be formed so as to
                    become truly serviceable, I leave to our generals to determine; I but wish, out of love for the
                    State, whose strengths I somewhat know, that we may be content with the resources allotted to us by
                    Nature; that we not despise our national troops, but earnestly strive to form them rightly, for it
                    is certain and remains so, that we are not able to maintain a sufficient army entirely of standing
                    troops; and that we aim to make do with a lesser fund than now is expended upon the land-military.
                    <br>
                    <br>For if in our state administration we cannot so order matters that a surplus of ordinary
                    revenues over ordinary expenses is realized — which necessitates retrenchment in all departments,
                    and naturally in that which absorbs so considerable a portion of the State’s income — then shall the
                    State’s debt never be extinguished; for it is altogether impossible, by extraordinary tax alone,
                    without the aid of such surplus and such savings from the ordinary revenues, to manage that burden.
                    <br>
                    <br>We shall incessantly, even in times of peace, feel the weight of a war's expenditure; and when
                    the moment of seriousness, the true outbreak of war, arrives: the State, already depleted and
                    exhausted beforehand, shall be unable to withstand it.
                    <br>
                    <br>I know well that I say naught that is pleasing, but I also know that in saying this, I fulfil my
                    duty.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let us not forget — and let our statesmen and men of war not forget — that we number but around
                    two million souls, and thus form only one of the middling powers among the states of Europe! If we
                    place our fleet alongside some 25,000 men of land forces, we arrive at 70–80 thousand men in arms
                    for a State of only two million people.
                    <br>
                    <br>Which of the great powers contributes proportionally more? Not France with its 20 million; not
                    mighty Austria; not vast Russia; not even Prussia, which — though it is said to expend 11/13 of its
                    revenues upon its forces — has 5–6 million souls, and under a single monarch has conquered Silesia
                    and West Prussia — those fair and populous lands, which encompass 1,300 square miles, while Denmark
                    and our German provinces comprise but 952.
                    <br>
                    <br>I shall now append a few lesser, though not altogether unimportant, observations, according to
                    the order of the tables.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXII. Where the number of children is lower, either marital fertility must be lower, or
                    the number of marriages is smaller: the latter is commonly the case in towns, where unmarried
                    persons are ever more numerous than in the countryside. But whence comes the remarkably low number
                    of children in the first age class, only 139, in the Faroe Islands — where there is no town, and
                    where, according to Table XXXVI, a notably large number of married couples is found? The decline
                    from the average proportion of 202 to merely 139 is far too great, and the lack of marital fertility
                    most striking — which indeed must be the sole cause of such a drop.
                    <br>
                    <br>Likewise in Schleswig, the number of children lies below the average, although the number of
                    marriages slightly exceeds the mean.
                    <br>
                    <br>Conversely, in Holstein, the number of children is considerable, despite the number of marriages
                    being close to the average — thus, greater fertility than in Schleswig.
                    <br>
                    <br>Greater still is the number of children in Iceland, where, according to Table XXXVI, there are
                    exceedingly few marriages. I therefore suspect errors in the census lists — all the more since
                    Iceland, in Table XXIII, lags significantly in the number of children aged 9 to 16.
                    <br>
                    <br>The very highest number of children is found in Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, where the number of
                    marriages lies somewhat below the mean.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXIII. Here, Norway distinguishes itself — as it already did in Table XXII by standing
                    above the mean — before all other states by a numerous youth in the age class from 9 to 17 years,
                    particularly in the countryside.
                    <br>
                    <br>Tables XXVI & XXVII. In these age groups, the Faroe Islands and Iceland are most notable.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXVIII. And yet more so the Faroes in this class. Norway, on the other hand, lags behind —
                    although it most certainly has, as is known, a great number of elderly persons. Yet the age class is
                    too broadly defined.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXXI. Here, the surplus of the female sex is, without exception, remarkable in all the
                    states.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXXII. Likewise here, and particularly in the towns.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XXXVI. And most prominently in this class, from which it seems to follow, on the one hand,
                    that women generally live longer than men; on the other, that towns are especially inhabited by
                    elderly women (widows).

                    <br>
                    <br>Here I have little else to add, save that I must express my regret that it never occurred to the
                    author of the schema how proper it would have been — and indeed of no small utility — to know how
                    many widowers and widows there are in the state. And since no distinction has been observed between
                    those who yet live in matrimony and those who have once been married but now live in widowhood, the
                    entire division between the married and unmarried — to speak plainly — renders the whole operation,
                    in this regard, of little to no use.
                    <br>
                    <br>I especially found cause to lament this want of information concerning widowers and widows when
                    I was instructed to investigate the matter of widows’ funds, wherein the proportion of widows to
                    subsisting marriages, and other such matters and questions, is of considerable consequence. To
                    remedy this deficiency in some measure, I have caused an inquiry to be made regarding these
                    circumstances in the city of Copenhagen and throughout the island of Zealand, the results of which,
                    so far as Copenhagen is concerned, are already corrected, and as soon as the work is completed in
                    full, all shall be laid forth — with the appropriate reflections — to serve as an appendix to this
                    part of the census.
                    <br>
                    <br>All that may be derived from the census-lists, as they now stand, with respect to matrimonial
                    life, is the number of married couples, which may be taken as equal to the number of married women,
                    it being unlikely that many wives were absent from their dwellings at the time of the enumeration.
                    <br>
                    <br>Among a total of 1,911,440 persons, there are recorded 368,755 married women. I could not here
                    make use of the full total of 2,017,027 persons, since some of the lists were manifestly carelessly
                    drawn, and thus invalid, so that it was best to exclude all persons therein recorded, together with
                    the married women noted therein.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this it follows that, among every thousand souls — taking all states together — there are
                    193 married couples. If we now add the unmarried persons of the 4th to 7th stages of life — in all
                    114 — to twice the number of married couples, i.e. 386 (whose children those unmarried persons can
                    hardly be), we obtain the number 500, and the other half may rightly be regarded as the children of
                    these married couples.
                    <br>
                    <br>Against 368,755 wives there are recorded but 347,979 husbands; yet these 20,776 lacking husbands
                    cannot all be considered as merely absent, for among them are included the married royal sailors and
                    soldiers standing under arms.
                    <br>
                    <br>But in Iceland and the Faroe Islands there are no such military persons, and yet in Iceland 57
                    husbands are wanting for every thousand couples, and in the Faroes even 76 husbands. Were they
                    emigrated? Or have they perchance not been enumerated?
                    <br>
                    <br>— In Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, 43 husbands are lacking in every thousand couples, and these
                    were doubtless, for the most part, absent in Holland, where they may nonetheless not have been
                    forgotten.
                    <br>
                    <br>In Norway, 67 husbands are wanting per thousand; in Denmark, 66.
                    <br>
                    <br>In Holstein, none are lacking, notwithstanding the garrisons in Rendsburg and Glückstadt.

                    Reflections on the Classes according to Means of Subsistence. Tables XLVI–LIX.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XLVI.Norway, above other states, possesses but few servants, both in the civil and in the
                    ecclesiastical estate (as appears also in Table XLIX). Yet Iceland and the Faroe Islands have an
                    exceedingly great number, presumably because the inhabitants live so far apart and scattered, that,
                    owing to the many small districts, a considerable number of attendants is nevertheless required.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XLVII.Oldenburg and Delmenhorst show an extraordinary number of civil officers within the
                    towns, for there are only two towns, and these but small, whereas the country enjoys its own
                    separate and fairly well-furnished government.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table XLIX.Denmark has, in particular, a numerous clergy, while Norway has but a weak one; for
                    in the former, the parishes are small and many, whereas in the latter, the parochial districts
                    (præstegjeld) are few and extensive, and encompass many annex churches, which are served by
                    chaplains who, on such scant provision, are not in a condition to marry.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LIII.Here it becomes even clearer than before what I have said regarding Norway: that it
                    is lacking in the pursuits of urban trade. It has, in total, only 89 townsmen per thousand
                    inhabitants, town and country taken together, and of actual tradesmen, but 47. From this it follows,
                    that the Norwegian peasant is obliged to produce for himself all that in other lands the countryman
                    purchases ready-made in towns; that it is thus no wonder if to the Norwegians are imported shoes,
                    stockings, and an endless variety of household goods; and that herein lies a most proper occasion
                    for the founding of manufactures and for opportunities of sale—if only the more affluent Norwegians
                    would be inclined to speculate a little more in this regard.
                    <br>
                    <br>The average proportion is 121, and Denmark indeed possesses somewhat more, namely 139, but it
                    falls far behind the duchies, which boast 225, and likewise behind Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Thus
                    vastly greater is the urban industry in the German provinces—not only in the towns, but as may be
                    seen from Table LIV, also in the countryside, namely in villages and market towns, of which there
                    exist in said provinces several of greater significance than the small towns of Denmark.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LV.Here is lacking a precise distinction between a manufacturer and an ordinary tradesman.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LVI.I fear that the persons employed in the census did not, throughout, attach the same
                    conception to the word “peasant,” and that in some provinces both the higher and lower ranks of
                    rural dwellers were counted, whereas in others only the lower class thereof was entered under this
                    heading. I draw this inference from the low ratio of 329 or 363 found in the German provinces.
                    Likewise, uncertainty prevails regarding those who combine agriculture with seafaring or fishing, as
                    to whether they were counted among the peasants, the seamen, or both.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LVII.From this it results that conjugal fertility is greatest among the peasantry in the
                    counties, next in Norway, and by far the lowest in Denmark.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LVIII.It is worthy of remark what we learn from this table: namely, that by far the
                    greater part of our seamen are native to Norway, and that Denmark, though composed of islands and a
                    peninsula, possesses fewer—indeed, even fewer than the German provinces. Moreover, Denmark’s seamen
                    dwell chiefly in the towns, whereas Norway has more of them even in the countryside than in the
                    cities, both by reason of its seafaring and its fisheries.
                    <br>
                    <br>Table LX.Likewise among the seafaring class, as formerly among the peasantry, conjugal fertility
                    is manifestly greater in Norway than in Denmark, and everywhere greater in the countryside than in
                    the cities. Otherwise, compared with the peasant class (as in Table LVII), no particular superiority
                    is to be discerned among the seamen, though Buffon ascribes such to the consumption of fish.
                    <br>
                    <br>Tables LX through LXVIII.When I compare the great number of domestic servants listed for the
                    German provinces with the modest tally of peasants in Table LVI, it appears to me probable that, in
                    said table, the farmhands and servants were counted together with the peasantry in the kingdoms, but
                    not so in the German provinces.
                    <br>
                    <br>Everywhere we observe more female than male servants, especially in the cities, and most notably
                    in Norway. Particularly striking is the extremely low number of servants in Altona, especially of
                    the male sex. This, indeed, may be attributed to the multitude of lesser families who cannot afford
                    to keep servants—particularly among the Jewish population—but also, I would suggest, to a certain
                    frugality prevailing among the inhabitants of Altona in this matter.
                    <br>
                    <br>Tables LXIX through LXXVII. Here again, Altona most honorably distinguishes itself by the
                    remarkably low number of indigent persons, as do likewise Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. On the
                    contrary, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, and in particular Copenhagen and Bergen, stand out most
                    unfavorably in this regard.

                    <h3>Eighth Section.</h3>

                    Reflections upon a Comparison between the Consuming Class, composed of civil officers,
                    ecclesiastical ministers and the indigent, and the Nourishing Class, composed of citizens, peasants
                    and seamen. Table LXXVIII.
                    <br>
                    <br>Here above all, Altona commands our attention, which presents only 52 consuming members of the
                    civil community, against 948 nourishing. Few state officials, few domestic servants, few poor
                    persons burdening the public. Truly, Altona is deserving of observation!
                    <br>
                    <br>Indeed, civil liberty, wherever it is permitted to take root, on such a stage of human
                    diligence, draws together many mortals of modest means, who must toil sorely to maintain a meagre
                    subsistence; but, as we plainly see, they do subsist, and under the feeling of liberty—which allows
                    each man his freedom, but also lays upon each the necessity to do his utmost—they find contentment
                    in life, each contributing his share to the treasury of the state, and become a burden neither to
                    the state nor to one another.
                    <br>
                    <br>So it is likewise in Amsterdam, where there are thousands of poor souls who throughout the year
                    scarcely taste a true morsel of bread—bread made of grain—and yet there are no beggars to be found.
                    <br>
                    <br>I challenge the restless science of statecraft, which so gladly entangles government in the
                    industrious pursuits of its subjects, and everywhere lays obstacles in the path of men’s free
                    striving, with commands and prohibitions—I challenge it to show whether its anxious refinements have
                    ever brought about that which almighty freedom, from Altona to Canton, freely and rightly produces.
                    <br>
                    <br>And I remain firm in my principle: Let there be little interference of government in the
                    industry of its subjects—save for protection and justice—and the more freedom, the better!
                    <br>
                    <br>In Iceland, however, and in the Faroe Islands, the number of consuming members of society is
                    particularly great; but these provinces are also weighed down by the yoke and tutelage of company
                    and monopoly trade, and are deprived of the benefits of commercial competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>Norway, in comparison with Denmark and the German provinces, possesses the fewest consuming
                    members of the state.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let it be remembered that in this Table LXXVIII, there is no mention whatsoever of the military
                    establishment. How much might be said on that burden — admittedly a necessary one, yet also the
                    heaviest of all burdens upon the state — which has become intolerable for all European nations since
                    the establishment of standing armies! But — sat prata biberunt; I must content myself with referring
                    to the few thoughts I have expressed on this subject in my Consideration on Freedom and Property in
                    the Peasant Estate, pages 40 to 42 (or pp. 25–26 of the new edition).
                    <br>
                    <br>On the other hand, I cannot pass over in silence a wholly superfluous enlargement of the
                    consuming class, which has arisen quite recently through the introduction of numerical lotteries.
                    <br>
                    <br>All the reasons of policy and of morality unite — to the shame of human understanding — in
                    opposition to this pernicious invention.
                    <br>
                    <br>I know not how any man could more poorly spend his time than by poring over the lottery
                    listings, and I truly pity those who, by virtue of their office, must ruin their hours with such
                    affairs. It is positively revolting to behold in Hamburg and Altona the countless collector
                    placards, and in the newspapers the endless lottery advertisements.
                    <br>
                    <br>The entire lottery is, in truth, nothing but a “jeu de dupe”, where there exists no proportion
                    between the great hazard of the players and their faint chance of success; and it gives rise to that
                    widespread evil, whereby the common man, instead of applying himself to honest gain by industry and
                    thrift, is infected with a spirit of idle illusion, dreaming of wealth without labour, and thereby
                    drawn into dishonest behaviour.
                    <br>
                    <br>For what in all the world — I ask — does a man, who earns his bread in the service of the
                    lottery, truly contribute to the common good? And yet he lives at the expense of that very
                    commonwealth!
                    <br>
                    <br>The ninth section is missing; also, the remarks that constitute it have been occasionally
                    inserted in the other sections.

                        <br>Plan
                        <br>For the Enumeration of the People
                        <br>In the
                        <br>State

                    </h2>
                    The plan I intend to propose is a standing plan for an operation that must be repeated from time to
                    time, if it is to be of use and provide the government with useful knowledge: perhaps every five or
                    every ten years.
                    <br>
                    <br>For the procedure in this operation, I adopt the following two principles:
                    <br>
                    <br>First Principle: In such a survey, one gathers answers to ten or even a hundred questions just
                    as easily as to one or but a few.
                    <br>
                    <br>Second Principle: One must require nothing more from those employed in the survey than mere
                    information and data regarding individuals; on the contrary, not only should they be excused from
                    any classification, but they should even be forbidden from attempting it.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this follows what might in some measure be called the third principle: the establishment of
                    a permanent bureau for the management of this undertaking and for the processing of the collected
                    data — such as the permanent Table Office Commission in Sweden.
                    <br>
                    <br>If the small expense of a Table Office — which would be staffed by a registrar (a chamber
                    secretary could serve in this role) and a clerk — should be considered objectionable, and if the
                    whole matter is deemed indifferent or trivial, then it were better to abandon it entirely; for from
                    incomplete and carelessly gathered data, there is ever but little to be gained.
                    <br>
                    <br>The inquiry into all the various circumstances — the importance of which is easily discerned by
                    anyone who understands the purpose of such enumerations and their wide-reaching influence on nearly
                    all parts of state administration — may, at first glance, seem somewhat extensive. Yet the burden
                    truly falls only upon the person tasked with processing the collected information. The gathering
                    itself, at each of the countless individual places where the inquiry is conducted, remains but a
                    minor effort.
                    <br>
                    <br>If the one entrusted with the processing of the material understands order and method, he will
                    easily find his way through even the largest heap of materials, provided that these materials are in
                    themselves reliable, clear, and unconfused. This they can be, if nothing is demanded beyond answers
                    to clear questions. But should those persons employed in collecting the data either wish or be
                    required to compress and classify the individual responses under general headings, then they would
                    each need to hold in their mind the method of the registrar as clearly as he himself does — which
                    cannot reasonably be expected, nor ought it to be demanded.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 1.
                    <br>The enumeration is conducted according to houses, and each house which stands independently on
                    its own ground, and is not connected to others by shared space or common household, is listed under
                    its own heading; thus, country houses and garden houses, if inhabited at the time of the census, as
                    well as multiple houses belonging to one and the same owner, are all recorded as separate houses.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 2
                    <br>By the term householder is understood any person who, whether as proprietor, as the proprietor’s
                    authorized representative, or, if it be a public house, as its overseer, has authority over the
                    premises.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 3
                    <br>By the term party within a house is meant any person who stands in no household connection or
                    dependency with the householder, such as exists between spouses, between parents and children still
                    under their provision, between master or mistress and their servants, and generally among those who
                    belong to one household or are counted as such. Each such person, even if alone and having none
                    dependent upon them, shall be considered one party.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 4
                    <br>The term stranger is here taken solely in the sense of being the opposite of a housemate. Thus,
                    a person lodging for payment in an inn, though otherwise a foreigner, is not considered a stranger,
                    but constitutes a party of the house. On the other hand, a person who happens to lodge, on the night
                    of enumeration, with a relative — even a child with its parents, if no longer under their provision
                    — is to be regarded as a stranger.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 5
                    <br>Collectors are those persons who undertake the gathering of information from a certain number of
                    individual houses or districts, and who compile the printed forms thus filled into bundles.
                    Principal Collectors are those with whom the collectors’ bundles are deposited and assembled into
                    larger main bundles.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 6.
                    <br>The authorities assign to each collector and principal collector his designated district. The
                    collector issues to every householder as many copies of the form for householders and parties, as
                    outlined in Appendix Lit. A, as there are parties in the house—counting the householder himself as
                    one party. The householder distributes these among the parties, and returns all forms duly filled
                    with the required information to the collector. Should any party consist of more than 9 persons, an
                    additional form is provided to the head of that party—or as many as are needed—and at the top is
                    written Continuation.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 7.
                    <br>The collector, who is presumed to possess knowledge of the houses and their inhabitants within
                    his district, reviews the forms returned to him to ascertain whether they have been completed
                    according to the directions given therein, and whether the reported details align with his own
                    knowledge of the persons and circumstances. If any evident discrepancies are found, he is to inquire
                    further with the householder. If no errors are discovered, he binds together the sheets belonging to
                    different parties within the same house, and all sheets belonging to a given house—or a single
                    sheet, where there is only one party—constitute a bundle.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 8.
                    <br>The authority responsible for conducting the census ensures with great precision that the
                    districts assigned to each collector are clearly defined, and that no house is omitted. To that end,
                    the principal collector provides each collector required to submit their bundles to him with a
                    detailed register of all houses located within each district, and furnishes to each a copy of the
                    form for collectors, as listed in Appendix Lit. B. These forms, duly completed, are to be returned
                    together with the house register to the principal collector, who examines them collectively to
                    verify that no house has been overlooked.

                    <br>§. 9.
                    <br>The principal collectors repackage the bundles submitted to them by their designated
                    sub-collectors into larger principal bundles, as previously stated, and attach to each such bundle a
                    register of the collectors and their districts. These principal bundles are then submitted to the
                    magistracy of the city or administrative office by which they were appointed; and from the
                    authorities of the cities and administrative offices, the bundles are forwarded to the stiftamtmen
                    (district governors) in the two kingdoms, to the governor in the duchies, and to the chief
                    provincial administrator (Oberlanddrost) in the German counties. Thus, all information from each
                    province arrives together and at once at the desk of the registrar appointed to process the
                    material.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 10.
                    <br>Each collector seals his own bundle, leaving open the form received from the principal collector
                    pursuant to §. 8. Each principal collector likewise seals his principal bundle, but leaves open the
                    register of collectors and their districts. The authorities of cities and administrative districts
                    have the principal bundles packed into chests, which are sealed and marked with the name of the city
                    or district, and simultaneously submit a register of the principal districts to the higher
                    authorities. These higher authorities then number all chests in continuous sequence and forward them
                    to the registrar, accompanied by a list corresponding to the assigned numbers.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 11.
                    <br>This task is managed throughout the cities by the magistrates, and in the countryside by the
                    administrative officers (Amtmänner), within whose jurisdiction the houses are situated, without
                    regard to any alternative forum or special privileges of the inhabitants. Thus, in this operation,
                    all royal castles—even those serving as court residences—garrison barracks, sailors' dwellings, and
                    similar are placed under the authority of the magistrates; all counties and baronies, as well as
                    noble estates, under the administrative officers; and likewise in the duchies, the monastic and
                    noble districts, together with those of cathedral chapters, fall under the jurisdiction of the local
                    Amtmänner, or under a special arrangement as circumstances may require by the governor. All this is
                    so ordered, that the houses and their inhabitants, which are locally grouped, are not to be
                    separated from their geographical connection due to considerations foreign to the purpose of the
                    undertaking—for without this, no precise and reliable enumeration is possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 12.
                    <br>It will be necessary, with regard to Copenhagen, that the foreign ministers, residents, and
                    agents be properly requested to consent to this harmless inquiry, which in no way is prejudicial to
                    them, being conducted in their residences. Concerning the joint sovereignty in the Duchy of
                    Holstein, it may be necessary to seek an agreement with the Grand Ducal Court in that regard.
                    Likewise, with respect to Schleswig, the Glücksburg territory should not be excluded.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 13.
                    <br>Indeed, the operation can be carried out at any time of the year, since the instruction
                    contained in the form for householders and parties ensures that absent natives and present
                    foreigners are noted separately. However, it is undoubtedly always better to choose a day in winter,
                    especially in states such as the Danish, where so many are engaged in seafaring. I therefore propose
                    January 2nd, if it is a weekday, or January 3rd if the 2nd falls on a Sunday. Thus, every person
                    shall be listed and counted in the house where they spend the night from January 2nd to 3rd—or, in
                    the aforementioned case, from the 3rd to the 4th—whether as a household member or as a guest. If
                    they are away from their usual residence, they are to be recorded in their home as absent but not
                    counted there. In this manner, no person can be overlooked, and none counted twice, provided that
                    the householders and parties give accurate information—which there is no reason to doubt, if the
                    public is clearly informed of the true purpose of the operation and any suspicion is dispelled, and
                    if the collectors omit no house and otherwise verify the data with due care.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 14.
                    <br>As for the few travellers who may not spend the census night under a roof, but instead be on the
                    road or at sea, it is to be ordered that they be recorded and counted as travellers in the house
                    from which they departed before midnight on the evening in question, by land or by sea. In the
                    houses where they might arrive after midnight, however, they shall not be recorded at all, but
                    entirely omitted.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 15.
                    <br>I would well wish that, in order to incite the Collecteurs and Chief Collecteurs to diligence
                    and accuracy, they would be awarded a reward for their toil, and that one would not spare some
                    expenses, which occur only every five or ten years. One might give the Collecteur half a Danish
                    skilling for each form sheet received from the houseowners and parties, and the Chief Collecteurs
                    half a Danish skilling for every ten such sheets, which, if we reckon the total number of people at
                    about 2,100,000 heads, and five heads per party on average, might amount to 2406 1/4 Reichsthalers,
                    and together with the costs of printing the forms and of transport in their distribution and return
                    to the Registrar, about 3000 Reichsthalers; all once every five or ten years, whereby this operation
                    would be carried out in a manner as yet unknown to any nation, and knowledge would be gathered, upon
                    which both mankind in general, the state in particular, and the servants of the state in every part
                    of its administration, have an infinite interest, and which, at the due time, when the operation has
                    been repeated several times, by comparing the results of various enumerations, would shed a most
                    extraordinary light upon the state economy.
                    <br>
                    <br>§. 16.
                    <br>A Registrar, who has method in his head and skill in this business generally, must, as said,
                    know how to approach the matter; nevertheless, I will further give a regulation by which he may
                    undertake the processing of the enumeration materials thus collected. He is furnished with a
                    sufficient number of loose printed slips, according to the forms seen in Appendix Lit. C. He begins
                    his work with the packages of the subordinate Collecteurs, and as soon as he takes a package, he
                    assigns the Collecteurs a number in continuous series, enters the name of the Collecteur and his
                    district in a special album kept for this purpose, and places this number on all slips he handles
                    during this collection. When he has thus gone through all districts belonging to a chief collection
                    and extracted the forms of the houseowners and parties, he packs these forms together again and lays
                    them aside in good order, but in return takes another album, in which he numbers the chief districts
                    in continuous series as he processes each one, also takes a new set of slips, writes the word
                    "Chief" before the printed word "Collecteur" on each, and adds the number of the chief district. On
                    these thus marked slips, the information from the first slips is gathered and concentrated; from the
                    extracts of slips for the chief collections arise slips for entire towns and counties, from these
                    for entire provinces, and finally for the entire state. What really costs effort and time are the
                    first extracts from the sheets of the houseowners and parties; the remaining work then consists in
                    addition of the numbers distributed on the special slips and filling in the columns.

                    <br>Memoranda
                    <br>
                    <br>By the name householder is understood every person who, either as proprietor, or as agent of the
                    proprietor, or, if it be a public house, as overseer thereof, hath authority therein.
                    <br>
                    <br>By the name party in a house is understood every person who stands in no domestic connection or
                    dependence upon the householder — such connection as subsisteth between spouses, between parents and
                    children who are yet under their care, between master and servant, and in general between persons
                    belonging to a single household or accounting themselves such. Every person under such conditions,
                    even though living alone and having none dependent upon them, shall be reckoned as a party.
                    <br>
                    <br>Stranger is here taken solely in the sense opposed to housemate. Thus, a person lodging for
                    money in an inn, even though otherwise a foreigner, is not considered a stranger, but constitutes a
                    party of the house. On the other hand, a person lodging on the night of enumeration with a relative
                    — even a child with his parents, provided he is no longer under their care — is to be reckoned a
                    stranger.

                    <h4> Concerning the Forms for the Slips used by the Registrar</h4>
                    <br>The various questions, the answers to which are sought in the forms of the householders and
                    parties, may conveniently be reduced under the following rubrics, which I, for the sake of brevity,
                    and that the headings of the slips may appear more distinctly, shall express by Latin terms:
                    <br>

                    <br>Religio (Religion)
                    <br>
                    <br>Each slip hath at its head the printed title:
                    <br>District of the Collecteur No.or
                    <br>District of the Chief Collecteur No.
                    <br>
                    <br>Some are also printed with blank spaces for the inscription:
                    <br>Town N. N. or
                    <br>Jurisdiction N. N. or
                    <br>Province N. N.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thereafter followeth the rubric of questions, the answers to which upon the slip are copied from
                    the enumeration form. Thereafter, the questions belonging under that rubric stand in vertical order
                    beneath each other, and to the right a vertical line, behind which the numbers are to be written.
