                    On Paper Money.
                </h2>

                <section id="chap2">
                    <br>The convenience of conducting monetary transactions by the pen, without counting the money out
                    to one another, which is provided to merchants of one and the same place through a transaction bank
                    (GiroBank); – in which convenience, combined with another, namely having one's circulating funds
                    kept in safe custody at such a public place, more securely than any private house could offer – and
                    moreover in the great advantage of the accounting unity of such a bank, in having a fixed and
                    unchanging standard of measure for all objects of commerce, all goods – therein lies the benefit of
                    such transaction banks; the similar convenience which the use of bills of exchange affords to
                    merchants throughout the world –: this double usage and substitution of paper in place of money,
                    which however is limited to certain persons explicitly named in the document each time, and which
                    bears the nature of a formal order and transfer – has led to the idea of extending this use to the
                    general public, such that no person is named as the recipient in the paper, but rather that whoever
                    holds the paper is to be considered its owner, and thereby to ascribe fully to the paper the
                    characteristic of money, which passes from hand to hand without formal transfer.
                    <br>
                    <br>And to this idea has been added the discovery that the issuer of such paper money, if it
                    succeeds in circulating, can to a certain degree acquire an artificial wealth, which is just as real
                    as an equivalent quantity of precious metals or coinage. For if the issuer of the paper money has
                    credit – and without it, the circulation of the paper is nowhere possible – it is not to be expected
                    that, without an agreement among several who hold such paper money in circulation, or without an
                    explicit move by an individual who exchanges it for his own ends, a significantly large portion of
                    the circulating mass of paper money should at once return to the issuer for realization and
                    redemption. Therefore, the reserve of coin which the issuer must keep ready for such redemptions
                    need not be as large as the amount of paper issued. And the surplus of this mass over the quantity
                    of coin held in reserve is the issuer's profit: a solid fund upon which he can earn interest, on the
                    assumption that he will issue no paper without receiving value in return; and a perpetual fund,
                    since it is not to be supposed that he would cease to earn profit without necessity, nor that he
                    would voluntarily redeem his paper money while it remains in undisturbed circulation.
                    <br>
                    <br>An intentional return of a large quantity of notes at once, as just mentioned, must be
                    anticipated by the issuer and operator of a note bank at the outset of their enterprise; but once
                    such an event has been withstood and repelled, and this test has been passed, one can thereafter be
                    fairly confident that it can be revised successfully; for the event is associated with considerable
                    costs and inconveniences for the one who initiates or arranges it. Therefore, the new note bank does
                    not need to have a reserve of coin equivalent to the total mass of notes it has issued, and which is
                    kept idle or, as it is called, inactive; it only needs to maintain a friendly connection with other
                    public or private banks, in order to obtain any necessary supplemental funds, which can easily be
                    provided, because they are only needed for the moment of the event. Once the storm has passed,
                    everything returns to its normal course, and the bank’s credit is thereby strengthened.
                    <br>
                    <br>But from the very beginning and onward, at all times and hours — in the overall operations and
                    in the dealings of each individual day — the operator of a note bank must remain mindful that the
                    entire existence of his bank rests upon public opinion: upon the conviction, confirmed by
                    experience, of every note-holder, that his note is as good as coin, and that he may convert it into
                    coin at will at any moment. Where such confidence is solidly grounded, paper money can even surpass
                    coin in certain respects, particularly in terms of convenience in various transactions. Only under
                    the presupposition of such well-founded confidence does what was said above remain true — that the
                    advantage which a note bank confers upon its entrepreneur is a solid capital fund; only under this
                    condition can such a bank serve the common good — or rather, only under this condition can it be
                    reconciled with the public interest, and deserve toleration within the state. And since everything
                    depends on the preservation of this delicate plant — opinion and credit — I shall, in what follows,
                    return again and again to this principal matter, and what is here said is only preliminary.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is already evident from what has been said thus far — and will be further confirmed by the
                    considerations to follow — that a paper or note bank must be the bank of the state. For why should a
                    private individual, a subject of the state, or why should a society of private individuals, subjects
                    of the state — indeed, perhaps not even subjects but foreigners — enjoy a benefit which the state
                    itself can enjoy, and which is only possible through the direct involvement of the government and
                    the application of its authority?
                    <br>
                    <br>I speak of the government's involvement and the application of its authority — and with this, I
                    proceed to one of the promised considerations. It is universally acknowledged that coinage is a
                    royal prerogative, which the government reserves to itself, along with the associated benefits and
                    revenues, and which must never be entrusted to private hands, since money is the standard of all
                    commerce among subjects. How much more, then, must the issuing (minting) of paper money be regarded
                    as such a prerogative, when this form of money derives entirely — in both substance and form — from
                    human labor? Hence, it should be briefly noted, even greater vigilance is required here than in
                    coinage against counterfeiting, since what human hands have made can undoubtedly also be imitated by
                    human hands. Moreover, such money can attain neither esteem nor circulation except insofar as the
                    government recognizes it in the state treasuries, receives it, and disburses it.
                    <br>
                    <br>The aims for which the introduction of paper money in the state may rightly be considered useful
                    — indeed, I say more: universally admissible — can only be achieved if such a bank is in the hands
                    of a wise government. And before proceeding to a detailed consideration of these aims, I will
                    briefly state my view: such a bank ought to be subordinated to that collegiate body which, at
                    various times in the administration of the state, is entrusted with the oversight of the subjects’
                    industry; and the profit arising from the circulation of paper money should be left to the prudent
                    disposal of this collegium. In this way, active governmental support of the subjects’ industry (I
                    say support by means of assistance, never by participation as a co-interested party in any
                    undertaking) would become possible, without burdening the state’s treasury or its subjects. Clearly,
                    then, a note bank in the hands of a wise government accomplishes more for the benefit of industry
                    than such a bank in the hands of a group of shareholders — and this also because shareholders divide
                    among themselves the profit derived from the use of artificial wealth, so that the benefit to
                    industry consists solely in the existence of a bank that lends at slightly below customary
                    commercial interest rates. By contrast, the collegium could allow the stated profit to flow into the
                    industry through the support of useful undertakings — possibly through loans entirely free of
                    interest, or even through outright grants of appropriate sums.
                    <br>
                    <br>Objections against a note bank in the hands of the government rest on the claim that private
                    individuals can more easily obtain credit than a government. But such an objection is not only
                    disrespectful to wise governments—it is also unfounded. Everything in the use of paper money depends
                    on maintaining the proper and serviceable ratio between the amount of paper put into circulation and
                    the reserve of coin prepared for its redemption. If that ratio is exceeded, it matters little
                    whether the bank is in the hands of the government or in those of a company of shareholders who, in
                    lending to the government, issue too much paper. Yet such a loan is all the more burdensome for the
                    government, since it—being ultimately responsible—must in the meantime pay interest on something
                    that has no intrinsic value but derives its worth solely from public confidence. However, if this
                    excess does not occur, then there is no reason why the public—daily taught by the unimpeded and
                    arbitrary exchange of paper for coin—should trust the government less than it does shareholders.
                    Perhaps it is thought that shareholders can be compelled through legal means? But that is not as
                    easy in practice as it may appear in theory: let him try who can to compel such a bank to redeem its
                    notes when it has issued them in too great a quantity for the service of the government.
                    <br>
                    <br>Before proceeding further, I must insert some reflections on the numerus, or the mass of money
                    circulating within a state. When the inhabitants of a country—favored by nature with gifts from land
                    and water, by diligence, skill, enterprise, and timely use of time in producing natural goods,
                    refining them, and in all kinds of labor that serve human need and pleasure—and aided by wise
                    regulations from the government which, without placing fetters on the pursuits of its subjects,
                    offers not only protection but, as appropriate, support—when, I say, under such favorable
                    circumstances, the inhabitants of a country succeed to a greater or lesser extent in producing a
                    volume of natural and manufactured goods that exceeds the value of the necessities they import from
                    other nations, then they receive the value of this surplus in gold or silver, according to the price
                    these noble metals command by general opinion and the course of world affairs; and these metals
                    gradually accumulate in the country as a whole. At the same time, in such prosperous foreign trade,
                    domestic exchange among citizens increases, assigning to each his modest share of national profit.
                    All goods in the state—movable and immovable, all labor and services rendered from one person to
                    another—gain, in this vigorous economic activity where everyone strives to give their best, ready
                    buyers for what they have to offer and willing sellers for what they need, and thus their price, as
                    determined by competition. And this price rises, as naturally does the price of all things in
                    demand, and rises all the more as the noble metals are increasingly drawn from the earth and placed
                    into circulation—altering, more or less noticeably, this conventional measure of human exchange.
                    Simultaneously, among the class of those who, through thrift, inheritance, or other favorable
                    conditions, acquire monetary reserves they can lend at interest, both the number of lenders and the
                    size of their holdings increase, and interest rates fall. This condition—which may be likened to the
                    full-blooded health of a sound and well-nourished body, with its favorable and also adverse
                    circumstances—is a natural consequence of commerce and global trends, in which the government as a
                    whole can do little.
                    <br>
                    <br>But the case is quite different when it comes to the artificial expansion of the money supply
                    through paper money: the state it produces is not one of full-blooded health, but of bloatedness.
                    The adverse consequences of an increased money supply—such as the rising prices of goods and labor
                    which hinder the sale of natural products and manufactured goods; the insufficiency of fixed incomes
                    for private individuals; the inadequacy of capital funds for public institutions; the insufficiency
                    of fixed revenues for the state, leading to the need for new expedients and levies—all these
                    inconveniences, which must be tolerated under an accumulation of metallic money and which resemble
                    the unavoidable consequences of a healthy body’s full-bloodedness, arise just as much from paper
                    money as from metallic currency. But not the reverse: the positive effect of low interest rates
                    cannot be expected from paper money with the same reliability. Indeed, this expectation rests
                    worryingly on a fallacy—that because interest rates are usually low in wealthy countries, lowering
                    interest rates must therefore be the path to wealth. The difference between a situation that arises
                    of its own accord and a forced lowering is like the difference between effect and cause; just as
                    great as the difference between hard money and paper money, considered as means and causes; just as
                    great as the difference between reality and opinion, between the thing itself and its symbol. Even
                    though the substitution of a sign for the thing may take place to a certain extent, maintaining
                    public confidence does not permit that this extent be set too broadly. Paper money can and must not
                    constitute a large portion of the total circulating money supply; thus, the volume of money that can
                    be loaned at lower-than-customary interest rates cannot be especially large either; and therefore,
                    the effect that might be expected from the introduction of paper money upon the general lowering of
                    the interest rate cannot be especially significant—particularly since the quantity of paper money
                    once issued cannot be increased, and nothing further can be done with it beyond mere redistribution.
                    <br>
                    <br>I now proceed to consider the most prudent ratio of the quantity of paper money to the quantity
                    of coin circulating in the state, as well as the cash reserve that must be held ready for
                    redemption. If it were possible to estimate the amount of coin in circulation within a nation with
                    any certainty—which it is not, as any government-initiated inquiry would be a dangerous operation
                    and always subject to concealment—then one could also state with precision the advisable proportion
                    of paper money. However, one will not stray far from the mark if one modifies the paper money
                    quantity in relation to the annual revenues of the state—revenues which, under a well-ordered
                    taxation system, stand in some proportional (though not exactly definable) relation to the level of
                    economic activity, just as the inflows and outflows of revenue into and from the state treasury are
                    proportionate to the total quantity of money circulating throughout the nation. Thus, I would
                    recommend not exceeding a fourth of the state’s annual revenue: partly because an artificially
                    arranged, rather than spontaneously occurring, accumulation of money must remain moderate if it is
                    not to become harmful; and partly because a state that holds assets as backing for the paper money
                    it circulates—assets that may not be immediately convertible into cash—would never find the
                    redemption of paper money particularly burdensome, should it become necessary on a large scale or be
                    deemed advisable for other reasons, if this can be covered with at most a quarter of one year’s
                    income. – I would also advise setting the ratio of paper money to the coin reserve for redemption at
                    3 to 1; under which condition the aforementioned temporary recourse to the state treasury, in the
                    event of a sudden mass redemption of paper money, would be needed all the more rarely and less
                    frequently. And even if this reserve, as one may reasonably suppose, is only drawn upon occasionally
                    and in small sums—sums then replenished by the treasury in coin in exchange for paper—the state will
                    still have, in this reserve, a constant and ready means for dealing with any suddenly arising
                    emergency.
                    <br>
                    <br>Let us suppose, for example, a state with 10 million in annual revenue, and in which the
                    standard interest rate is 5 percent; then the amount of paper money to be created would be
                    2,500,000, and the coin reserve would amount to 833,333—rounded to 850,000. The paper money would be
                    placed under the administration of the Economic and Commercial College, as a fund to support the
                    trades and industries of the subjects. The reserve would be regarded as a loan from the state's
                    treasury to the Economic and Commercial College, either interest-free or bearing 4 percent interest.
                    The College would lend out the 3.5 million in paper money, against adequate security and at 4
                    percent interest, to subjects, individuals, or municipalities, for such economic undertakings and
                    purposes of every kind as deserve such favorable treatment via the lower interest rate—on terms that
                    are not too short but also not too long—so that each year part of the amount would be repaid and
                    could be re-lent to others, allowing a broader range of beneficiaries to participate in this
                    support. The interest income would thus total 100,000, of which 34,000 would be payable to the
                    treasury as interest on the reserve—should the treasury claim such interest. The remaining 66,000—or
                    the full 100,000—would, after deduction of administrative costs, be applied annually, if sufficient
                    reason exists, to support useful trades: by means of loans at 3 or 2 percent, or even entirely
                    interest-free for a limited time, always against security; through grants and premiums; through
                    schools for instruction in all forms of trade; through experimental ventures in every sector of
                    industry, and so forth. And should there not be sufficient justification for the full use of this
                    annuity, the surplus is added to the fund and loaned out at 4 percent like the rest—yet without
                    increasing the total quantity of paper money in circulation.
                    <br>
                    <br>A state that has managed its finances such that it can, from an annual surplus of revenue over
                    expenditure, accumulate a treasure for the future—should such a treasury grow significantly during a
                    prolonged period of peace, and should it be tolerable that a portion of it be drawn upon to remedy
                    national calamities, to bolster the credit of a particular province, or to support a specific sector
                    of subsistence—may simultaneously stimulate the circulation and incidentally restore some of the
                    currency withdrawn from circulation through saving. Such a state, I say, could then increase the
                    amount of paper money by the same sum it intends to withdraw from the treasury, and retain this
                    amount—consisting in hard coin—in the treasury as the equivalent backing of the newly issued paper
                    money.It may also be accepted—indeed, it must be admitted—that in times of necessity, which excuse
                    all, a state might resort to the use of paper money; but only with the firm resolution to withdraw
                    it immediately after the crisis has passed. Nevertheless, it remains a desperate remedy, and
                    Frederick II of Prussia is notable in this regard for the fact that none of the hardships of the
                    Seven Years’ War ever led him to such emergency measures.Under no circumstances, however, can the
                    use of paper money be regarded as a solution to a persistent deficit—where expenditures continually
                    exceed revenues. In this respect, the invention of paper money is the most questionable and
                    unfortunate invention one could resort to in public finance.
                    <br>
                    <br>One cannot deny—and few would want to deny—that issuing paper money is equivalent to incurring
                    debt; people merely comfort themselves with the idea that this debt bears no interest. Yet even this
                    notion is not entirely correct, since this kind of debt inevitably brings with it costs that are
                    worse than agreed-upon interest payments. Combined with the tempting prospect of having an immediate
                    solution at hand whenever money appears to be needed, this leads, first and foremost, to a lulling
                    of concern for the future and to a readiness to incur expenditures and launch undertakings which,
                    though perhaps sound under certain conditions, are nonetheless ill-suited to the current state of
                    affairs, not carried out with the necessary frugality, and which would have been avoided had the
                    difficulty of raising funds provoked and strengthened a healthy sense of caution about the matter.
                    <br>
                    <br>Furthermore, this form of debt—where no creditor steps forward to demand interest payments—may
                    seem exceedingly convenient for as long as all goes well. Yet in truth, the public is the creditor;
                    and when it awakens, it proves the most troublesome and unrelenting of all creditors. With an
                    ordinary creditor, one can negotiate, one can come to terms regarding any delay in payment; and once
                    reassured, one enjoys peace and quiet, at least for a time. But the reactions of the public, once it
                    awakens and its trust—the opinion on which the circulation of paper money solely relies—is shaken,
                    are unceasing and are reproduced in every individual holder of a note. What then arises is a
                    convergence of unforeseeable, entangled circumstances, spreading confusion and harm throughout the
                    state, both internally and externally—circumstances I can only briefly touch upon, for a detailed
                    treatment would go too far.
                    <br>
                    <br>As soon as the opinion—that a note is as good as hard coin—is disturbed by obstacles placed in
                    the way of redeeming the full face value of the note in coin, then everyone begins to make the
                    distinction; and at that point, paper money becomes the very instrument by which every shilling of
                    hard currency is driven out of the country. Physically, its export cannot be prevented; and legally,
                    it cannot be prohibited—for by what right can one prevent someone from using their property—and
                    money is indeed the owner's property in the highest sense—in the most advantageous way possible,
                    that is, where it yields the greatest benefit?
                    <br>
                    <br>Then, from that moment on, the numerical prices of all goods settled in paper money begin to
                    rise. – All promissory notes and contracts denominated in money become unstable, and disagreements
                    arise between the contracting parties. – The servants of the state, who are paid in paper money from
                    the treasury coffers, and who cannot make it go as far as coin, complain with justification. –
                    Everything also becomes more costly for the state itself: and it finds itself compelled, wherever
                    the paper cannot be obtained in equal number to coin, to compensate the difference in value
                    numerically. – A multitude of notes come into circulation, issued below their literal value, yet for
                    which full value is demanded upon redemption. – A disadvantageous exchange rate arises, since
                    payments to those who have funds in cash or credit abroad can only be acquired at high cost. – There
                    is a constriction of the state’s debts in commercial matters; namely, instead of the state settling
                    its interest payments by the shortest route – being in debt is indeed an evil in itself and remains
                    so – yet the repayment does not influence the transactions between the state's merchants and those
                    of other nations, regarding mutual exports and imports: under financial shortage, the government
                    must turn to merchants and have payments executed through them as well as can be done, often with
                    delays. And since, in this way, the interest on the national debt always adds to the import volume,
                    then necessarily, as the export volume falls, the state becomes one who owes more than it has to
                    claim.
                    <br>
                    <br>One then resorts to palliatives which—without remedying the evil at its root—merely cause futile
                    expense: such as, for instance, that from time to time a sum is employed, insufficient in regard to
                    the entire mass of paper money, yet never insignificant for the already indebted state, in order to
                    redeem a quantity of notes where their appearance becomes particularly pressing, so as to induce a
                    fall in the exchange rate; which, however, like every effect that ceases with its cause, immediately
                    vanishes again, so that the entire operation is nothing more than pouring a little water upon a hot
                    stone.
                    <br>
                    <br>The accumulation of notes in service of a state which knows not how to meet its needs with hard
                    coin is nothing but an anticipation of its future revenues—often for many years ahead. The future,
                    once it arrives, then brings with it its own necessities, partly foreseeable, but often arising
                    unexpectedly: and even a great state, favoured by nature, may fall into political weakness and must
                    come to realize that only money is the nervus rerum gerendarum—the sinew of all action—acknowledged
                    as such throughout the world. – The state then learns that the enticing appearance of borrowing
                    money from the public, for the moment, without interest, is in truth most harmful; and that the cost
                    of remedying the inconveniences which inevitably follow is far greater than the interest of a
                    properly founded loan—structured for repayment and leaving time for orderly measures—could ever have
                    amounted to.
                    <br>
                    <br>The cure for this evil is, like the cure of every physical, moral, or political ailment which
                    has gradually and imperceptibly grown over time and then bursts forth in dreadful magnitude,
                    exceedingly difficult. Palliatives are of no help; evasions and contrived tricks, which a true
                    financier either does not know or, knowing, despises, avail nothing; and there exists in statecraft,
                    as in household economy, no other counsel against debt than to pay—beginning, if the burden be too
                    great, with prudent measures that first afford breathing room and time for effective remedies; then
                    proceeding without delay, with wisdom and firmness, to retrench and to economize.
                    <br>
                    <br>A circumstance in the case of state debt consisting in paper money, which especially calls for
                    prudence, is that—most likely, upon close examination of the origin and progression of such debt—it
                    will always be found that the state has issued much paper without having received equivalent value
                    in return, though such value is nonetheless demanded according to the letter of the note. To avert
                    this intolerable loss, the financier must strive to reacquire, as far as possible and with
                    propriety, the paper issued against real value at below that value upon redemption. Yet only the
                    prudent man, and he who enjoys the personal esteem and confidence of the public, will succeed
                    therein.
                    <br>
                    <br>Two operations must proceed together and pari passu (step by step): within the country, where
                    certainly the largest portion of the paper mass—partly still in actual circulation, partly perhaps
                    already withdrawn and lying in larger or smaller pledged depots—is found, the removal of the paper
                    from circulation must be pursued through negotiation with its holders; outside the country, a modest
                    sum in the two noble metals must be raised on such terms as to allow time for further measures. Here
                    again, an extraordinary amount depends on the trust a government earns with regard to its integrity
                    and steadfastness in its measures. The latter operation, without being linked to the former, is of
                    little use; the realization of paper money by means of newly minted or recalled coin is impossible
                    until the entire mass of circulating paper money is markedly diminished—for whence should come the
                    metal to redeem all? And if paper, circulating alongside and in competition with coin, exists in
                    overwhelming quantity, then all insertion of coin is but water poured in small measure upon a hot
                    stone—always water laboriously carried up the mountain, and there poured out without a dam to
                    prevent its escape.
