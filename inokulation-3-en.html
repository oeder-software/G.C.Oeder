                <h3>Recollections concerning the account found in the previously printed writing of Mr. Court Physician
                    Tode (for May, p. 411).

                </h3>

                1) At the words: “as well as for the precise recording of what was observed.” – Both Mr. Wither and I
                noted down our observations, as I was present at all dissections, and likewise the journal for the year
                1770 was kept by me.
                <br>
                <br>2) This small land, the little island of Aunøe – Aunøe belongs to the demesne fields of the royal
                domain estate of Vordingborg, and the farmer dwelling there has been allotted but a small piece of land
                for his subsistence; otherwise, the island is used at the king’s expense, as lord of the manor, and for
                many years has been employed for haymaking. In the year 1770, it was not under lease, and thus could be
                handed over by the Royal Directorate of Taxation – under whose administration the domain estates in the
                districts of Vordingborg and Antvorskov stood – to the Royal College of Commerce for the conducting of
                these experiments. Mr. Wither made do in the farmhouse on Aunøe with a poor chamber, the only one the
                farmer could spare. I had my lodging in the parsonage in the church village of Kiøng, the inhabitants of
                which, as well as those of the annexed villages Sallerup and Kostradebye, belong as labor-bound subjects
                to the domain estate of Vordingborg. I drove over daily, at least once, to Aunøe via Svinøe, which also
                is part of Kiøng parish, but otherwise belongs to the estate of Gaunøe, held by Count von Thott. I had
                two routes to Svinøe: either by land across the isthmus, or first a stretch by water. The water between
                Svinøe and Aunøe is at times very shallow, yet I never saw it so shallow that one could pass entirely
                with dry feet; seldom is the water so high that one could not pass through in a chaise. Likewise, from
                Sallerup one can most of the time drive across by carriage, though it is deeper there. On account of
                these shallows, Quarter A is enclosed on the sides toward Svinøe and Sallerup with a fence; but in all
                other directions, the island is only accessible by water. I remark in passing that the water in Quarter
                A is called Purrmose.
                <br>
                <br>3) In the second quarter, B, were kept the just-inoculated cattle, until such time as they became
                ill. In the first summer of 1770, this was not yet the case, for then Quarter B was solely designated
                for the convalescents, whom one endeavoured carefully to keep separate from our own healthy cattle, that
                these might not be infected, and likewise from the sick, in order to be securely assured that, when
                these convalescents, after some time and after proper washing and cleansing, were to be removed from the
                island, they might not carry infection to wherever they should be brought. In the year 1770, the cattle
                that were to be inoculated were brought to the sick quarter, were there inoculated, and remained there.
                But when I, as can be seen above from the notes of the 9th of November, was led to the thought that the
                inoculated cattle ought rightly to remain separated from the sick from the time of the operation until
                the manifestation of the illness, I advised that in future years this separation should be observed,
                which was then indeed done by Mr. Wither.
                <br>
                <br>Properly, four distinct places are required: 1) for the healthy cattle, 2) for the sick, 3) for the
                newly inoculated, and 4) for the convalescent.
                <br>
                <br>4) In that part of this quarter which lay furthest removed from the coast of Zealand, the
                inoculation was performed. In the year 1770, it was done near the huts. The operation of inoculation
                itself carries no danger of distant contagion, and thus it was altogether indifferent to Zealand in
                which part of this quarter the inoculation was effected. A far more significant circumstance was the
                dissection of the dead cattle. This was carried out opposite the land tongue stretching from Vordingborg
                to Knudshoved, beside the huts, upon a slope descending toward the shore, where the cattle were also
                buried deep into the ground. The vapours unavoidably arising from the dissected cattle, as well as from
                the sick huts and the surrounding terrain, might, under winds blowing across, have caused infection in
                Zealand. However, in such a case, our cattle, grazing freely in the open air in Quarter A, over whose
                heads the wind from Quarter C passes toward Zealand, must of necessity have been the first, and within
                ample time, to have been attacked — if the spread of cattle disease by way of vapours through the air
                over distance were indeed possible and to be feared. Such would be a calamity too great, one which must
                arouse fear for the complete extermination of the entire breed of horned cattle, and would render the
                otherwise proven security through avoidance of communication entirely incomprehensible.
                <br>
                <br>Moreover, there lies a contradiction between this and the previously treated matter under No. 3; for
                if the newly inoculated cattle remained in Quarter B until they fell ill, and only then were brought
                into the sick quarter C, why then should one wish to bring them to Quarter C already for the operation
                of inoculation, and not rather perform this act — quoad momentum actus, wholly innocent in itself —
                likewise in Quarter B?
                <br>
                <br>5) The remainder were, because it was not desired to retain so many, sent to the estate of
                Beltringe. The words because it was not desired to retain so many I do not quite understand; rather, I
                refer to the notes from the 11th and 26th of October. The contents therein I submitted again separately
                to the Royal College of Commerce under the date of October 15th, namely that, in case the then-expected
                outcome of the camphor trials should not prove favorable (which unfavorable outcome I did indeed report
                on October 26th), I would let matters rest for the time being and preserve the remaining cattle — 25
                head in total — for experimentation in the spring, seeking to place them at one of the royal estates. I
                therefore requested either permission to act at my own discretion and according to circumstances, or
                else an express order to continue the inoculations.
                <br>
                <br>On November 4th I received a reply stating that, as an experiment was desired to ascertain the
                effect of the cold, I could abandon my post so long as I knew where I could accommodate the cattle. Upon
                receipt of this response, I was necessarily compelled to make an immediate decision — either to
                inoculate all the cattle at once on November 4th, or else to send them immediately to a place where they
                might be kept under a roof, for they could no longer be left in the open, and no stables were to be
                found on Aunø. I therefore had them taken — in view of the most recent experience with 35 head, of which
                28 were lost, and which could not but deter me from any further inoculations that year — to Beltringe;
                and specifically to Beltringe, because there a completely new and clean stable, in which no cattle had
                yet been kept, neither healthy nor diseased, could be allocated to this herd. Nevertheless, they were
                infected with the disease; yet one fifth was preserved — exactly the same proportion as among the last
                35 head that had been inoculated.
                <br>
                <br>6) Most of the cows and heifers inoculated in the year 1770 were pregnant, and those that survived
                did calve — almost all at the proper time. The calves likewise mostly remained alive.
                <br>
                <br>Due to the commonly accepted and in itself plausible supposition that an animal which had been in
                the womb at the time when the mother had endured the cattle plague would thereby be protected against
                said disease, I requested that the calves expected from such infected mothers be carefully observed, and
                that attention be paid to their future fate, in order to determine to what extent this presumed
                privilege might be well-founded. Whether this was done, I do not know.

                <h3>
                    Further Considerations.
                </h3>
                7) In the aforementioned account contained in the Copenhagen publication, not a single word is given
                regarding the arrangement made for changing garments when going to and fro between the quarters A and B,
                especially C, and the hut erected for that purpose; yet this very arrangement is a principal
                circumstance to which we – as I am convinced – owe it that we were able to preserve our healthy cattle
                in Quarter A until the very end, that is, at the beginning of November, when the remainder was brought
                away to Beltringe, all still healthy, though they stood between our own sick quarter and the infected
                places lying opposite in Zealand, without a single animal falling ill before being removed for
                inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>Namely, along the path from A to C, within Quarter B near the barrier which separated B from A, a
                hut was erected containing four chambers; and by means of an open passage running through the middle of
                the hut, two of these chambers were separated from the other two. One chamber on each side was intended
                for myself and the surgeon, the other for the attendants. Whoever came from A and intended to go to C
                would remove his clean clothing in the first chamber, proceed in shirt and barefoot – at most only in
                stockings without shoes – to the opposite chamber, and there put on garments set aside for visiting the
                sick cattle. Upon returning from Quarter C, the reverse changing of clothes took place.
                <br>
                <br>Particular care was taken that no one might come from C to A with any footwear other than the clean
                shoes kept in the hut, and likewise no one barefoot either, so as not to carry dung or urine from the
                sick quarter onto the healthy pastures where the cattle of A were grazing. The actual caretakers of the
                sick cattle remained, as long as possible, in A, and their needs were brought to them.
                <br>
                <br>8) Furthermore, a shepherd appointed expressly for that purpose had to be stationed at the barrier
                between A and B, to keep watch and ensure that the cattle from A did not break through this barrier or
                otherwise wade across the bay from A to C. Likewise, the fencing on the sides of the island facing Svinø
                and Sallerup was diligently maintained—especially after the disease had broken out in the aforementioned
                villages—in order to prevent it from being brought from there into our clean Quarter A.
                <br>
                <br>One may easily be convinced, when considering the small size of the island of Aunø, that all this
                care could not have availed anything, had the disease found free passage through the air. But thus, the
                success of our precautions proves to us that it is indeed possible, even amidst neighbours afflicted by
                the disease, to keep it away from oneself.
                <br>
                <br>9) The inhabitants of Svinø, given their advantageous position, could—just as well as we on
                Aunø—have kept the disease at bay with similar care. A man from Svinø, who had let a couple of head of
                cattle graze in Kostrædeby, took them back again once the cattle plague had already broken out in
                Kostrædeby.
                <br>
                <br>In general, the disease began and spread from Næstved, advancing southward and eastward. It was
                present in the town of Næstved and in the surrounding villages before we began the inoculations on Aunø
                and had received our cattle from Bornholm, from where we also took the first material for inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>It broke out sporadically, now here, now there on individual farms, as long as people kept their
                cattle to themselves on their own enclosed fields. But it spread like wildfire and became general once
                the harvest was over and the cattle mingled on the open stubble fields.
                <br>
                <br>Given this well-known spread of the disease in Zealand on the one hand, and the unnatural leap the
                disease would have had to make—right over the heads of our healthy cattle—from Aunø to Zealand on the
                other, it is a striking absurdity to impute the slightest blame for the spread of the disease to the
                inoculation; and yet, there has been no lack of persons who have not hesitated to insinuate such things
                to higher authorities.
                <br>
                <br>10) The island of Bornholm, situated between Zealand and Scania, has never yet experienced the
                cattle plague, whereas both Zealand and Scania have more than once suffered its devastation. On such
                occasions, Bornholm has come to Zealand’s aid with entire herds of its admittedly somewhat small-sized
                cattle. For although Bornholm, owing to its considerable cattle breeding, does indeed export cattle, it
                never imports any.
                <br>
                <br>In Scania, as I have been assured by its inhabitants, the disease has always halted at the
                mountainous borders towards Småland whenever it approached them—presumably, among other reasons, because
                in these mountainous regions each farmer keeps his cattle separate and gathered on his own, and the
                farms themselves are scattered and lie far apart, rather than closely packed together in villages as on
                the plain. Consequently, the opportunities for transmission of the disease are infinitely fewer than on
                level ground.
                <br>
                <br>11) I am confirmed in the belief that our first inoculation in the year 1770 turned out so
                successfully precisely because it was the first, by the observation that others who tried the operation
                earlier, around the same time, or even later, experienced nearly the same outcome. Namely, when one
                inoculates in a place where the disease has not previously occurred, the cattle contract the illness
                solely through the inoculation, without the involvement of any other contributing infection—and thus
                things go well. But during the second, and even more so the subsequent, inoculations, the inoculated
                cattle come into an unclean environment, and then, quite naturally, things no longer proceed favorably.
                <br>
                <br>It is therefore a most essential precaution, which ought to be strongly impressed upon practice,
                that—as noted above under No. 3—one must provide four distinct places. Yet it always remains a
                considerable difficulty to prevent that the area where the cattle are to remain after inoculation, until
                the visible outbreak of the illness—what may for brevity be termed the inoculated quarter—might not be
                contaminated and rendered unusable, should the disease break out earlier and more severely in some
                beast, with drooling and thin dung.
                <br>
                <br>This would indeed pose a great inconvenience, were one to allow the inoculated cattle to pass this
                intermediate period in stalls or huts, for such structures are difficult to cleanse, and new ones cannot
                be built so frequently. However, these difficulties are largely avoided if inoculation takes place at a
                suitable time of year, such that stalls and huts may everywhere be dispensed with, and the inoculated
                cattle left to pasture in the open air. And even if such a tract of unbuilt land, designated as an
                inoculated quarter, should become soiled and unfit, a new location can usually be found—and if the
                cattle are fed a bit sparingly, and with fresh grass by hand, the land will scarcely suffer so much
                damage that one would, in the long run, lack unspoiled terrain.
                <br>
                <br>12) Note in reference to the Copenhagen memorandum.On the 20th of November 1770, I was appointed by
                His Majesty to the General Commission of Agriculture, and by the end of May 1771, to the Financial
                College; thus I could, of course, not be present at the inoculation on Aunø, which in any case (cf. the
                conclusion of the remarks under 9 November) did not require my attendance. Yet, as a member of the
                aforementioned Land Commission, to which His Majesty had in the meantime entrusted the administration of
                the aforementioned domains in the counties of Antvorskov and Vordingborg, I brought about the
                commission's resolution to continue the inoculation trials – all the more so (see the remark of 9
                November), as the commencement the previous year had been somewhat delayed.
                <br>
                <br>At that time, Mr. Wither and I agreed upon the procedure to be observed. I particularly insisted
                that the newly inoculated cattle be removed from the infected quarter until the outbreak of the illness,
                and I specifically advised to use only young cattle for inoculation, excluding pregnant cows, of which I
                had had so many the year before.
                <br>
                <br>In the same year, a house was also built in Quarter C on Aunø, on the initiative of the Land
                Commission – among other purposes, with the intent that, should the efficacy of inoculation prove
                itself, the island of Aunø would, in the first instance, remain designated for this purpose. The house
                was to serve initially as the residence for the surgeon conducting the inoculations, and thereafter the
                institution was to be opened for general use, so that any farmer, at his own risk and for a reasonable
                fee, might send young cattle there for inoculation, and receive it back after the disease and quarantine
                were overcome. In this way, the country might gradually be furnished with a stock of reliable cattle, so
                that in the event of future outbreaks, it would not suffer excessively — suffering doubly, as it were:
                not only through the immediate loss of the fallen cattle, but also indirectly through visibly diminished
                harvests, due to lack of manure. This lack is all the more detrimental in Zealand, where the proportion
                of land under plough is already too great, and of hayfields and pastures too little.
                <br>
                <br>13) It is certain that the disease, in and of itself, was already less virulent and deadly in the
                year 1771, and even more so in 1772, than it had been in 1770. It is thus quite natural to suppose that,
                in proportion as the constitutio epidemica (or, if one prefers, epizootica) became less malignant, so
                too the poison introduced by inoculation may have shown itself to be less potent.
                <br>
                <br>From this, however, a mistrust might arise concerning the reliability of these inoculations, and an
                apprehension as to whether the cattle inoculated in these later years would withstand a truly violent
                epidemic.
                <br>
                <br>Yet the experience with the animals from our first trial in the year 1770 – who recovered lightly,
                and yet in that very same year, when the disease unquestionably raged at its fiercest, endured the
                severest trials – may serve to calm such concerns.
                <br>
                <br>Nevertheless, it would still be desirable that some of those animals, doubtless still alive from the
                inoculations of the years 1771 and 1772, be subjected to new trials upon the return of the disease –
                which, by report, is now again present in Holstein. For it is of great, indeed of utmost importance, to
                attain certainty that an inoculated animal, even if only lightly affected during inoculation, and even
                if the epidemic was mild at the time, remains protected against further contagion, even should a future
                epidemic prove more malignant.
