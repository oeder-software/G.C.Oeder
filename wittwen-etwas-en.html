                Something about Widow Funds by Georg Christian Oeder.
                <br>
                <br>It is a precarious matter with widow funds: and yet they are not only a useful, but a necessary
                institution in every well-ordered state.
                <br>
                <br>By widow funds I understand such institutions where the pensions, conditionally allotted to wives,
                are based upon a formal contract between the institution and each interested party, who, in return for
                the burden assumed by the institution, undertakes on his part the prescribed terms and contributions;
                from which it follows that the wife, in the event of occurrence, receives and expects her pension not as
                a grace or favor, but as a right acquired for a set price. All other institutions bearing the name of
                widow funds, where the pensioners do not receive their pensions as the result of duly rendered,
                hazard-balanced praestanda in accordance with actuarial rules, but wholly or in part out of goodwill and
                mercy, belong among poor relief institutions, and their pension is more or less alms.
                <br>
                <br>Such widow funds of the latter kind, just like poor-relief institutions of every sort, are bound by
                a clear limit set by a state's means and capacities, as well as by natural equity. No state is rich
                enough for boundless charity, and no person in need has a right to state support beyond the extent that
                he is truly in need and his own utmost means, which he must bring to bear and exert, do not suffice; but
                he does have a right to such measures by which his exerted means are best and most appropriately
                applied. The poor person willing to work has the right to demand that he be given the opportunity for
                labor and fair earnings, when he cannot find it himself; and the provider and benefactor of a person in
                need, whose support he is in life and for whom he wishes also to care in the case of his earlier death,
                has a right—and the person in need even more so—to demand that there be no lack in the state of an
                institution which facilitates such care, or without which such care might indeed everywhere be
                impossible.
                <br>
                <br>If such an institution—namely, a widow fund based on the principle of voluntary contribution and
                contract—exists in the state, then those widow funds resting on the principle of alms become, to a great
                degree, superfluous; for the government can always more easily buy into the general widow fund on a
                contractual basis, once and for all, on behalf of those persons whose potential provision in widowhood
                it wishes, or is compelled by mercy, to assume—or grant them the entry sum in full or in part—than it
                can burden itself with their lifelong maintenance and with a separate institution required for that
                purpose.
                <br>
                <br>But, as said, it is a precarious matter with these widow funds, in the fixed and proper sense of the
                word. The principles according to which work has been undertaken in the newer institutions still appear
                uncertain and wavering, and the true theory—which in the end can only be one—has not yet been
                sufficiently established. Even the very foundation of the theory and of every calculation, namely the
                tables showing the gradual death of a given number of individuals born at the same time, still requires
                correction—something one is easily convinced of when comparing the various tables by different authors
                in various nations, indeed even from different regions within one and the same nation. In general, our
                present widow funds are still too new and youthful for one, based on what experience up to this day has
                taught us about them, to form decisive judgments for or against their design—judgments for which at
                least the span of a human life is required.
                <br>
                <br>This age had been reached by an institution which (through the establishment at the end of last year
                of the new Royal Danish General Widow Fund was dissolved), and which had existed in Copenhagen since
                1739 under the name Widow Pension Fund of the Land Military Establishment. Its arrangement was unfit for
                purpose, and thus it was also dissolved, although its decline was not felt until 1769, prior to which it
                was considered exceedingly safe and sound; and in the years 1771, 72, and 73, conviction of its
                nonetheless manifest decay could not be produced without forceful and obstinate opposition from its
                defenders. Its structure now matters little—at least, it is not my concern to discuss it here—but as an
                institution that existed into its 36th year, and into which over four and a half thousand married
                couples were admitted during that time, it is of utmost importance for the entire world—at least for the
                northern half of Europe—in regard to the arrangement of such institutions, in our age. Already in the
                year 1739, 401 couples were admitted, and from 1739 to 1745 inclusive, a total of 1035 couples. The fate
                of these 1035 couples was for the most part already determined by 1771, and must have been further
                determined by the end of 1775; namely, there can now scarcely remain many undivided couples, and among
                the widows and widowers arising from the separated couples, few can still be alive. Before I proceed
                further, I shall insert the following extract from the admission protocol.

                    <br>
                    <br> I now return to where I broke off above, and state that if one knew, for all the inscripti from
                    1739 to 1775—especially from 1739 to 1745 inclusive:
                    <br>
                    <br>how old each man and woman was at the time of admission,
                    <br>
                    <br>when each of the deceased persons, husband or wife, died—whether in marriage or in widowhood,
                    <br>
                    <br>who among these persons, man or woman, still lives—either in marriage or in widowhood,
                    <br>
                    <br>and how large the annually insured pension was for each woman,then one could test any desired
                    plan for a widow fund by this experience; namely, one could transpose any such plan into the time
                    elapsed since 1739 and calculate what the outcome would have been had such a plan been applied to
                    the participants of the Copenhagen military widow fund. And there would be no need to wait another
                    36 years in order to then—based on experience that, under a perhaps poorly devised plan, could prove
                    ruinous or at least exceedingly costly—arrive at a decisive judgment concerning such a plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>Moreover, this information would in general constitute an important contribution to the works of
                    Süßmilch and others like him, and would serve to correct the inferences drawn from a person’s
                    attained age to their probable future lifespan.
                    <br>
                    <br>Unfortunately, from 1739 to 1771, in the admission of married couples, no inquiry was ever made
                    regarding the age of the individuals—neither the men nor the women—although it is equally necessary
                    to know both; for without distinction of age, 40 Rixdollars of potential pension were promised in
                    return for a contribution of 100 Rixdollars for interested parties of the military estate, and 110
                    Rixdollars for those of the other estates. Thus, nothing concerning age is recorded in the books.
                    Moreover, the men were not properly obliged to report the death of their wives, so that one cannot
                    reliably determine from the records which marriages were dissolved by the wife’s death, or which
                    earlier unions may still remain undissolved.
                    <br>
                    <br>When I, in 1771 and 1772, by royal commission, investigated the condition of this military widow
                    fund (which, it may be recalled, bore the name "military" because it was originally intended for the
                    military estate and always remained under the direction of the War Chancery, although, after early
                    permission was granted for participation by other estates, it soon had just as many—and eventually
                    more—participants from those estates than from the military), I arranged in 1772 that, in order to
                    evaluate the risk posed by the existing widows and by those expected from the gradual dissolution of
                    marriages still intact at the time, and to compare this double risk amount with the actual status
                    bonorum—that is, the anticipated expenditure with the remaining balance of fully collected
                    income—there should at least be an initial inquiry made into the age of the still-living interested
                    parties.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the latter half of 1772, I was absent from Copenhagen. In 1773, whose first half I again
                    spent in Copenhagen, the question was still being debated: whether the military widow fund could
                    remain or must be abolished? And I could not proceed to the question of what should take its
                    place—thus, to the second half of my commission—namely, to provisionally submit a new plan. At the
                    end of June 1773, I left Copenhagen. At the end of that year, I was transferred from royal service
                    and have since had nothing further to do with the matter; consequently, I also had no part in the
                    establishment of the new general widow fund, nor could I prompt or pursue the continued inquiry into
                    the age of the participants in the military widow fund, or its extension to include the deceased, as
                    I would have done had I completed the second part of my commission.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is, however, to be wished—and, as I do not doubt, to be hoped—that this expanded inquiry will
                    still be carried out in its full extent, and the sooner the better, before inquiry into the oldest
                    participants is made ever more difficult, and finally impossible, by the passage of time and the
                    death of those able to provide information. And that such much-desired information—first of all
                    useful to the Danish states in their assessment of the new fund, but also to other states that have
                    or plan to establish such widow funds—may not be withheld from the public, but made known; indeed, I
                    may say, to mankind, as an experience otherwise not to be had for the time being, and which one
                    would otherwise have to wait another human lifetime to obtain.
                    <br>
                    <br>In putting forward this wish and plea publicly, I am certain I express the desire of all those
                    who care about the correction and expansion of this part of human knowledge—indeed, surely also of
                    more than one government, to whom the reliability of such institutions, whether already enacted and
                    in need of improvement, or not yet established, is of concern. I therefore make no immodest
                    request—so much the less immodest, since in the publication of this desired data (without naming
                    individuals, merely by means of the continuous numbers in the admission protocol), no cause for
                    concern can be imagined—no more than in the publication of yearly lists of the deceased, the born,
                    and the married.
                    <br>
                    <br>As soon as the aforementioned data regarding the ages of the widows—or pensioners—then living,
                    and of the men and women still living in undissolved marriage (in 1772), were collected and
                    communicated to me, I immediately made individual calculations of the risk associated with each
                    widow and each married couple, using three different rates of interest: 5 percent, 4 percent, and 3¾
                    percent.
                    <br>
                    <br>Whether the information was received for all and every widow and couple, I do not know—and
                    perhaps it is still incomplete to this very day. But at the time, I could not wait for that, nor was
                    it necessary for the purpose I then had in view. Once I had assembled a few hundred such
                    calculations, concerning widows and a few hundred married couples, I was able to draw a reliable
                    conclusion for the whole and state:
                    <br>
                    <br>The risk involved with a few hundred widows whose pensions together amount to a certain sum,
                    comes to such-and-such; therefore, the risk with all widows, who together receive a total annual
                    pension of 79,000 Rixdollars, must likewise be estimated at such-and-such, depending on the interest
                    rate. And because the calculated risk with that number of married couples—who had purchased a given
                    amount of eventual pensions—comes to a certain amount, the total risk associated with all couples,
                    to whom the entire sum of 257,000 Rixdollars in eventual pensions is insured, likewise amounts to a
                    corresponding value.
                    <br>
                    <br>The widows and couples whose ages were used for individual calculations were chosen purely as
                    chance and the gradual receipt of data allowed—without selection from their entire number.
                    Therefore, there was no reason to assume that their ages were higher or lower than those of the
                    rest, and it was more likely that among those considered for calculation, young and old were mixed
                    just as among the others.
                    <br>
                    <br>The risk on the 79,000 Rixdollars total of actually payable pensions I found to be 866,032
                    Rixdollars, and the risk on the 257,000 Rixdollars total of insured eventual pensions I found to be
                    1,308,500 Rixdollars—both at a 4 percent interest rate.
                    <br>
                    <br>After I had completed the individual calculations, I took the total sum of the ages of the
                    widows for whom the specific calculation had been carried out, divided this sum by the number of
                    these widows, and imagined instead of these many widows a single widow who had the calculated
                    average age and who received the entire pension sum of 79,000 Rixdollars. In like manner, I summed
                    the years of the husbands and the wives, divided each of these sums by the number of couples, and
                    similarly imagined a single married couple to whom the entire sum of 257,000 Rixdollars was
                    insured—so as to see to what extent such an overall computed evaluation would agree with those
                    evaluations derived from individual calculations.
                    <br>
                    <br>The average age of the widows was 54 years, of the husbands 47 years, and of the wives 37 years.
                    The risk for the sum of 79,000 Rixdollars amounted to 874,654 Rixdollars, and the risk for the sum
                    of 257,000 Rixdollars amounted to 1,288,470 Rixdollars. The difference between 866,031 Rixdollars
                    and 874,654 Rixdollars is 1.55 percent, and between 1,308,500 and 1,288,470 is only 1 percent.
                    <br>
                    <br>In both cases, therefore, the difference was negligible—only, in one case, the risk amount found
                    through individual calculation was the smaller, and the overall calculation produced the larger
                    figure, whereas in the other case it was the reverse.
                    <br>
                    <br>This observation has—let it be noted in passing—the benefit of showing to what extent one can,
                    in case of need, manage quite well with such a generally computed evaluation in place of the
                    laborious and detailed individual calculations, should one wish to perform a quick, summarised
                    assessment of the condition of a widow fund.
                    <br>
                    <br>In this connection, however, I must ask that it be well considered that these averages—54, 47,
                    and 37 years—were abstracted from a considerable number of participants in a widow fund that had
                    already reached its 33rd year, and that one must not expect to find precisely these same
                    averages—especially the average for the widows—among the participants of a still young institution.
                    <br>
                    <br>One must generally keep in mind that the crisis of a still young widow fund gradually forms and
                    adjusts itself, and only reaches maturity after the lapse of at least a human lifetime.
                    <br>
                    <br>And with this caution, I commend the above-presented excerpt from the reception register of the
                    Copenhagen Military Widow Fund to earnest reflection—as something from which one may already, quite
                    comprehensively, discern what every newly forming widow fund will, over the years, have to expect.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the evaluations I conducted in 1772, I assumed the following theory:
                    <br>
                    <br>The man’s expected future lifespan (according to Süßmilch’s tables, Volume II, p. 319 and p.
                    342—the latter being merely a corollary derived from the former) was taken as the duration of the
                    marriage. This stadium matrimonii was added to the woman’s current age, and the further lifespan
                    indicated in Süßmilch’s table at the sum of these years was regarded as the duration of widowhood,
                    or stadium viduitatis.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, in the case where the man is 47 years old and the woman 37 years old, the duration of the
                    marriage was taken as 19 years, and the duration of widowhood as 14 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>The discount (i.e., present value) of a semiannual pension payable 28 times is 21.8443; and this
                    sum, discounted back over 19 full or 38 half-years, gives (or, which amounts to the same,
                    subtracting the discount of a 66-fold pension from that of a 38-fold pension) a value of 10.027 as
                    the worth or price of the potential semiannual pension, as it should be determined upon admission of
                    the couple—or 5.0135 if the annual pension equals 1 and the semiannual pension thus only ½ or 0.5.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, since for every single rixdollar of annual pension, 5.0135 in risk or stake is calculated,
                    this risk for a total pension amount of 257,000 Rixdollars amounts to 1,288,470 Rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>Instead of this theory, I adopted a better one in 1773, and based on it, I drew up a plan for a
                    widow fund, which I now have completed.
                    <br>
                    <br>To tell the truth, the theory I worked with in 1771 and 1772—and which also serves as the
                    foundation for determining simplis in the Kalenberg institution—never fully satisfied me. Nor could
                    I, nor did I wish to, conceal from myself its deficiencies: namely, that in the assumption it makes,
                    every woman is presumed to outlive her husband; that in general the ages of the women are set too
                    high; and that the duration of marriage and the man’s remaining lifespan are not necessarily the
                    same.
                    <br>
                    <br>Nevertheless, the calculation based on that theory does not diverge so far from the results of a
                    better theory as one might think at first glance. For although the stadia viduitatis (widowhood
                    duration) are overextended, the same happens with the stadia matrimonii (marriage duration), and
                    both errors tend to cancel each other out.
                    <br>
                    <br>One might even excuse it on the grounds of granting an advantage to the institution—as one does
                    to the banker in a game of chance.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, the theory remains incorrect, and for that reason I abandoned it in 1773.
                    <br>
                    <br>According to my current theory, in the given case (casu substrato), the duration of the marriage
                    is 17¼ years, and the widowhood period is 8¼ years. Based on this, the contribution for each
                    individual rixdollar of annual pension is 3.5186 Rixdollars, and the corresponding semiannual
                    contribution is 0.14218 Rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>The total risk for a pension of 257,000 Rixdollars amounts to 904,280 Rixdollars, and the
                    semiannual contribution for such a pension sum comes to 36,543 Rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>According to Richard Price (in the book On Reversionary Payments, London 1771, pp. 320, 324,
                    342), the contribution is 4.303 for each individual rixdollar of annual pension—thus, for 257,000
                    rixdollars of pension, the contribution or risk amounts to 1,105,771 rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>Apart from the fact that my theory differs from Mr. Price’s theory, our basis calculi et
                    theoriae—our foundation for calculation and theory—is also different. I base my approach on
                    Süßmilch’s tables, whereas Mr. Price, in his Tables VI and VII (pp. 319–325), combines the
                    observations from Breslau (after Halley), Norwich, and Northampton, which he presents in Tables III,
                    IV, and V.
                    <br>
                    <br>According to my theory, the following durations for stadium matrimonii (marriage duration) and
                    stadium viduitatis (widowhood duration) result:
                    <br>
                    <br>from the Breslau table: marriage duration 16 years, widowhood duration 7½ years;
                    <br>
                    <br>from the Northampton table: marriage duration 16½ years, widowhood duration 7¼ years;
                    <br>
                    <br>from the Norwich table: marriage duration 17 years, widowhood duration 8 years.
                    <br>Based on these durations, the contribution per individual rixdollar of annual pension is:
                    <br>according to the Breslau table: 3.4141
                    <br>according to the Northampton table: 3.3422
                    <br>according to the Norwich table: 3.4626
                    <br>and as an average of all three: 3.4063.
                    <br>The further average between the above-stated mean of 3.4063 and 3.5186—my previous determination
                    based on Süßmilch’s table—is 3.4625. And if one wishes to take the mean between this and 4.303, the
                    contribution per Mr. Price’s calculation, the result is 3.8828 rixdollars in contribution for each
                    individual rixdollar of annual pension.
                    <br>
                    <br>Accordingly, the risk for 257,000 rixdollars of total insured annual contingent pension is
                    997,880 rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>We shall now retain this sum for comparison with widow funds on this side of the sea.
                    <br>
                    <br>According to the table of the new Royal Danish General Widow Fund, a 47-year-old husband whose
                    wife is 37 years old pays 37 4⁄6 rixdollars for 10 rixdollars of pension—with a surcharge of 10
                    percent if he is not in royal service, whereas for royal employees one month’s salary is taken
                    instead.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, he pays 41.4333 in contribution for 10 rixdollars of pension, or 4.1433 for 1 rixdollar of
                    pension. Therefore, for 257,000 rixdollars of pension, the contribution or risk amounts to 1,064,300
                    rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>This fund has therefore made sufficient provision.
                    <br>
                    <br>According to the table of the newly established Royal Prussian Widow Fund, such a man pays 37
                    rixdollars as an entry fee and contributes annually, at 4% interest, for a pension of 25
                    rixdollars—thus, for 257,000 rixdollars in pension, he pays 380,360 rixdollars as entry and annually
                    41,120 rixdollars in contributions.
                    <br>
                    <br>The interest at 4% on 380,360 rixdollars amounts to 15,214 4/10 rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>The entire annual payment—interest and contribution together—thus comes to 56,334 rixdollars, or
                    28,167 rixdollars semiannually.
                    <br>
                    <br>If from this semiannual periodic inflow of 28,167 rixdollars a present value equivalent to
                    997,880 rixdollars is to arise, it is required that this inflow be collected 62 to 63 times—that is,
                    in other words, that the marriage of this couple would last 31 years or slightly more.
                    <br>
                    <br>Can that be expected?
                    <br>
                    <br>Let the marriage last 17 years; then the periodic inflow of 28,167 rixdollars would be collected
                    34 times. Discounted, this yields 690,050 rixdollars, and compared to 997,880 rixdollars, that
                    leaves 307,830 rixdollars short, i.e., 30 85/100 percent too little.
                    <br>
                    <br>Can one then truly hope that, from the interest on 37 rixdollars entry fee and 4 rixdollars
                    annual contribution, the risk of a contingent pension of 25 rixdollars for such a married couple
                    could be sustained? And can one hope it more in any other case?
                    <br>
                    <br>According to the structure of the Kalenberg Widow Fund, such a husband pays 10 rixdollars as an
                    entry fee and assumes 59 Simpla in exchange for a pension of 10 rixdollars. It is assumed that a
                    19-year marriage is to be followed by a 14-year widowhood; at least, the contribution rate – i.e.,
                    the specified number of Simplorum – is calculated on such an assumption, namely 14 multiplied by 80
                    and divided by 19.
                    <br>
                    <br>For 257,000 rixdollars in pensions, the entry sum is likewise 257,000 rixdollars, whose interest
                    at 4% yields 10,280 rixdollars annually, or 5,140 semiannually. The number of Simplorum amounts to
                    1,516,300.
                    <br>
                    <br>The semiannual interest income of 5,140 rixdollars, expected 38 times over 19 years, has a
                    discounted present value of 135,904 rixdollars. Insofar as this interest income is intended to
                    offset the risk, it is deducted from the required 997,880 rixdollars, leaving 861,976 rixdollars to
                    be covered by the Simpla.
                    <br>
                    <br>To match this sum of 861,976 rixdollars with a semiannual contribution to be levied 38 times,
                    each such payment must be 32,606 rixdollars. When these are distributed across 1,516,300 Simpla,
                    each Simplum is worth 6 1/10 pfennig.
                    <br>
                    <br>If the interest income is not included in risk coverage, and the full sum of 997,880 rixdollars
                    is to be derived from the Simpla alone, then a semiannual contribution of 37,741 rixdollars is
                    required, and each Simplum must be worth 7 168/1000 pfennig.
                    <br>
                    <br>What then will happen, should it come to pass that a Simplum, which currently accounts for just
                    2¾ pfennig semiannually, must be redeemed at 6 1/5, 6 1/4, or even at 7 1/5 or 7 1/4 pfennig?
                    <br>
                    <br>And since 2¾ pfennig is clearly far too little in relation to the risk, how shall that which is
                    being neglected with the current contributors ever be made up? And even more: how shall that which
                    has already been neglected in the past, especially with the deceased contributors whose meager
                    contributions have left the fund now burdened with their widows, be remedied?
                    <br>
                    <br>The Bremen Widow Fund or support institution receives, according to a uniform ratio across all
                    classes (varying only with the size of the pension), 7½ rixdollars annual contribution and the same
                    amount as entry fee for 40 rixdollars of annual pension – that is, 0.1875 rixdollars as entry fee
                    and 0.1875 rixdollars annual (or 0.09375 semiannual) contribution per 1 rixdollar of pension.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, for a total pension of 257,000 rixdollars, the entry payment is 48,187 rixdollars, and the
                    semiannual contribution is 24,094 rixdollars. After deducting the entry payment from the necessary
                    997,880 rixdollars, there remains 949,693 rixdollars to be covered via the semiannual income – which
                    would require that this contribution be collected 79 times – something that is unlikely to be
                    expected.
                    <br>
                    <br>If it is only collected 34 times, then its discounted value is 590,260 rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>The aforementioned former Copenhagen military widow fund received 11 rixdollars as entry payment
                    for 4 rixdollars of pension – that is, 2.75 rixdollars per 1 rixdollar of pension. For 257,000
                    rixdollars of pension, this meant 706,750 rixdollars in total entry funds.
                    <br>
                    <br>Experience – a very burdensome and costly one for the King – has shown that it is not feasible
                    to promise all participants, regardless of age, 4 rixdollars pension in return for 11 rixdollars
                    entry, or 1 rixdollar pension against 2.75 rixdollars contribution – not even at 5% interest, which
                    the Copenhagen fund enjoyed until 1766, and certainly not at 4%.
                    <br>
                    <br>If one subtracts from this 2.75 rixdollars the 0.1875 rixdollars entry amount of the Bremen
                    fund, the remaining capital is 2.5625 rixdollars, for which a semiannual contribution of 0.09375 is
                    made – this must be paid 40 times. From 2.75 rixdollars in capital, one receives 6.0722 rixdollars
                    after 40 semiannual terms, and this suffices to pay a semiannual pension of ½ rixdollar only 14
                    times.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thus, the Bremen fund must be able to rely on marriages lasting 20 years, followed by 7 years of
                    widowhood, merely to match the Copenhagen military widow fund – which could not sustain itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>The Bremen widows’ fund suffers from the same fundamental flaw that has already been noted with
                    the Copenhagen Military Widows’ Fund, namely that no consideration is given to the age of the
                    participants. Even though in Bremen the men must provide their age, this makes no difference to
                    their contributions, and the age of the women is not inquired about at all.
                    <br>
                    <br>Yet it is obviously clear that of two men of different ages whose wives are of the same age, the
                    older man should pay more; and of two men of the same age whose wives differ in age, the man whose
                    wife is younger should pay more. In general, the older the man and the younger the woman, the
                    greater the risk to the fund—and thus the contribution should likewise be higher. Failing to take
                    this into account is contrary both to natural equity and to the order of nature, when no attention
                    is paid to the ages of the individuals, both men and women.
                    <br>
                    <br>Since the Bremen widows’ fund has existed since 1753, it would be desirable that henceforth the
                    age of the women also be recorded—something which does not seem difficult—and that the fund’s
                    administration would agree to publish such information as publicly useful facts and experience, just
                    as has been recommended in the case of the Copenhagen Military Widows’ Fund.
                    <br>
                    <br>To facilitate recalculation for those readers who may wish to do so, the adjacent table provides
                    the present value (discount) of a semi-annual payment of 1, at an annual interest rate of 4 percent
                    or 2 percent semi-annually.
                    <br>
                    <br><i>The tables on pp. 620 and 621 are missing.</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>All actuarial calculations in widows’ funds, all determinations of contributions by the
                    participants and the anticipated expenditures, presuppose an infallible and exact utilization not
                    only of interest but also of compound interest. And it is precisely therein that one of the
                    advantages lies, which many individuals, joining together for a common purpose, gain by their union:
                    namely, that their contributions, when pooled together into a capital sum, may bear interest and
                    yield fruits which could not be obtained from any of the small individual sums alone—thus
                    significantly easing the burden for each participant.
                    <br>
                    <br>Should this assumption fail in practice, and should such an institution even be left unprotected
                    against the loss of entire capital sums invested in mortgages, etc.—of which I know examples—then
                    not even the best theory or the utmost human prudence can help or avert the decline of a widows’
                    fund.
                    <br>
                    <br>But who can offer such reliable assurance? Who can guarantee not only the preservation of a
                    fund’s capital, but also a never-failing, uninterrupted return at a constant rate of interest, and
                    in general raise such an institution above all the mishaps and difficulties of a highly burdensome
                    administration, particularly when the fund's capital must be scattered in small sums among private
                    individuals? Who, if not a government?
                    <br>
                    <br>It thus appears to me as an almost necessary postulate for the existence of a widows’ fund that
                    the government of the land receive and administer the fund in trustworthy hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>I do not demand a government guarantee, that is, no guarantee regarding the balance between
                    resources and objectives, or the adequacy of revenues to cover expenditures—in a word, nothing
                    beyond the security of the fund's assets and the maintenance of order. I do not demand burdensome
                    state contributions or subsidies, since, under a properly designed plan, nothing further should be
                    needed for the contractual provision for potential widows than what may arise solely from the
                    husbands’ contributions and payments.
                    <br>
                    <br>On the contrary, I rather advise kings and princes to restrict their charity—which in the
                    context of a general widows’ fund cannot be appropriately distributed over the whole—to needy
                    individuals. But this benefaction, namely the assumption of the fund's assets in trustworthy hands,
                    I believe can rightly be requested in the interest of the public good.
                    <br>
                    <br>It should not be difficult for any government to manage such an institution's capital so that it
                    becomes a source of new, secure income—and thus the payment of interest to the fund (for the capital
                    itself, unless the fund collapses, will never—or at most, only in extraordinary circumstances, in a
                    small portion—be needed) cannot in the future become a burden to the state.
                    <br>
                    <br>The expression “to receive in trustworthy hands” encompasses everything that may be expected of
                    a wise—that is, a benevolent and just—government, and which must be expected in reverent confidence.
                    It also includes every concern that may arise in an anxious mind, and everything a sincere man could
                    possibly wish not to happen—and I rightly refrain from elaborating all the thoughts encompassed
                    herein.
                    <br>
                    <br>Widows’ funds, in the precise and proper sense of the word, are useful and necessary wherever
                    there are persons in need—that is, in every state—and there is no doubt that more of them will arise
                    in more states, as soon as the theory behind them becomes more refined and better understood, and as
                    governments increasingly become convinced of the possibility of establishing reliable institutions
                    of this kind.
                    <br>
                    <br>The widows’ funds that operate on an alms-based footing—which are likely found in nearly every
                    European state—prove that there is no general lack of goodwill on the part of governments, nor of
                    their attention to this branch of social policy. The true reason seems rather to be that, up to now,
                    rarely has a plan for a genuine widows’ fund been proposed that merited or gained acceptance and
                    trust.
                    <br>
                    <br>But the time may soon come when every state will establish such an institution of its own—thus
                    making it unnecessary for its subjects to seek refuge in the institutions of foreign states, and
                    even wishing to deter them from joining foreign funds.
                    <br>
                    <br>To this end, in particular, the previously stated consideration will also contribute: namely,
                    that it benefits the soundness and sustainability of a widows’ fund when the government accepts its
                    assets into trustworthy hands and assumes the role of its guarantor.
                    <br>
                    <br>Every government will always most gladly see its citizens entrusting their money to the state,
                    and it may generally be assumed—and all the more so where coercion plays no role—that the citizens,
                    for their part, will hold a special confidence in their own government.
                    <br>
                    <br>Such widows' funds as are here discussed are not institutions suited only to large states with
                    millions of inhabitants; rather, I consider a population of about 100,000 persons already sufficient
                    to allow chance free play, such that its laws can take effect.
                    <br>
                    <br>If, at the founding of such an institution, even just one in fifty married couples among the
                    16,000 couples one may confidently assume to exist in a population of 100,000 were to join, this
                    would already constitute a considerable beginning. And it is not necessary for the yearly intake of
                    new couples to be much greater than the number of couples lost annually through the death of one or
                    the other spouse, in order soon to gather a body of participants large enough that favorable and
                    unfavorable cases balance each other out.
                    <br>
                    <br>In a smaller state, however, one must set a proper limit on the highest pension the institution
                    is willing to insure, because it could certainly be problematic to pay out a high pension that only
                    a few couples could afford to purchase the right to—among whom adverse events might occur without a
                    corresponding number of favorable cases to offset them. Nevertheless, the conditions of such a
                    smaller state will naturally impose an appropriate limit on the maximum pension.
                    <br>
                    <br>Experience has taught us nothing—at least nothing definite so far—that would justify a
                    distinction in calculation between unmarried and married women, and it shows us no clearly
                    established difference, at least not yet, in the laws or patterns of life and death between the
                    sexes. The likely remaining duration of life, from any given point in time, must therefore be
                    assessed for both men and women according to the same table.
                    <br>
                    <br>There is thus no reason why the care for those in need could not also be extended to women not
                    standing in a marital relationship—as has, for instance, already been done in the new Royal Prussian
                    widows’ support institution—so that a father might provide for his unmarried daughter, a brother for
                    his sister, or any man, whether related or not, might secure a pension for a woman upon his death.
                    <br>
                    <br>Indeed, there is no reason why one could not go even further than the Royal Prussian institution
                    has gone, and extend such provision also to men who, upon the death of their benefactors or
                    providers, are at risk of falling into hardship—which surely is not an uncommon case.
                    <br>
                    <br>To express the principle more generally: since everything depends only on the age of the
                    prospective pensioner, and the age (and health at the time of contract) of the person—male or
                    female—whose life or death the pension depends on, there is no reason why the rule should not simply
                    be: A receives a pension when B dies, regardless of the gender of A and B.
                    <br>
                    <br>For those who everywhere fear abuses far too much, and who, ever mindful of the saying propter
                    abusum non est tollendus usus, are inclined rather to reject a good scheme on account of possible
                    abuses than to consider how abuses may be simultaneously prevented within the scheme – and indeed
                    printed warnings against widows’ funds are not lacking, because widows might thereby become
                    careless, idle, overindulgent, prone to independence, averse to new marriages, and the like – for
                    the sake of such anxious persons, and to soothe them where possible, I must also remind that the
                    authorities, as elsewhere, are entrusted and tasked with assessing abuses and the means against
                    them.
                    <br>
                    <br>And that in all cases where the person to be favored by a potential pension is not necessarily a
                    spouse, the one who wishes to provide pension to such a person, and on whose life or death the
                    enjoyment of the pension depends, must have limits and conditions set either by general regulations,
                    or may even be required to obtain special permission from the authorities for their undertaking,
                    before he and his client may be admitted to such an extended widows’ fund, or as it could rightly be
                    called, a general provision fund.
