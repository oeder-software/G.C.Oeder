                </h2>
                <i>
                    *) This small but significant essay, which Mr. Stiftsamtmann Oeder kindly communicated to me, is the
                    first fulfillment of my recent request for contributions to German statistics, which may soon draw
                    more from the desks of German patriots.
                    — Dohm.
                </i>
                <br><br>
                In Mr. Möser’s valuable, both useful and agreeable book Patriotische Phantasien, Part 1, p. 246, a
                calculation is presented regarding 116,664 people who were counted in the year 1772 in the Osnabrück
                bishopric (Stift); and on p. 240 it states that this bishopric, according to the map prepared by Mr.
                Lieutenant Colonel von dem Bussche, covers 28 square miles, thus 4,166 people per square mile.
                <br>
                <br>For a resident of Oldenburg, two things are striking and surprising: Firstly, that the counties of
                Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, which according to the map of Councillor Vochenrich contain 45½ geographical
                square miles, and on the map of the joint district appear roughly the same size as the Osnabrück
                bishopric—or rather seem slightly smaller—should nevertheless be much larger than this bishopric.
                Secondly, that these counties, in which 79,071 people were counted on August 15, 1769, thus only 1,736
                per square mile, should be so much less densely populated than the nearby Osnabrück bishopric, and that
                the latter should be able to boast of a population density scarcely found in any other part of Germany.
                <br>
                <br>For lack of von dem Bussche’s map, I have consulted the Homann map published by Joh. Heinrich
                Meuschen in 1753, and find there that Osnabrück has customary local miles which relate to geographical
                miles as 17 to 12, and thus only 10 10/17 of these make one degree of the equator—just as Oldenburg also
                has local miles, of which 11¼ make one degree. The square of 17 is 289, and the square of 12 is 144, so
                that an Osnabrück square mile is accordingly about as large as two geographical square miles. Therefore,
                it should be understood that the 28 square miles of the bishopric are Osnabrück miles—that is, 56
                geographical square miles—whereupon there would be 2,083 people per geographical square mile, and the
                contrast between such neighboring lands and parts of the same district in terms of size and population
                disappears.
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Möser’s patriotic Westphalian schoolteacher is still right against the Frenchman who calls the
                schoolteacher’s homeland la vuide Westphalie (the empty Westphalia) (p. 244), because if 19 million
                people (according to Bauban) are distributed over France’s area of about 9,700 square miles, only 1,958
                people per square mile result.
                <br>
                <br>Otherwise, one may also question the calculation presented on p. 246 consisting of 12 categories of
                people in the Osnabrück bishopric, to what extent the 21,135 people listed in the last six categories
                are already wholly or partly included in the first six categories or not. If we set these 21,135 people
                aside, since it is doubtful whether they are not counted twice in the total of 116,664, then the net
                total is 95,529 over 56 square miles, distributed as 1,706 people per square mile, and Osnabrück and the
                counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst become quite equal in terms of population.
                <br>
                <br>I will also briefly add a comparison of the mentioned counts in the Osnabrück bishopric and in the
                counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Among the 95,529 people in the first six categories of the
                Osnabrück list, there are 46,173 males compared to 49,356 females, thus a surplus of females of 6.89%.
                In the counties, this difference is 5.53%.
