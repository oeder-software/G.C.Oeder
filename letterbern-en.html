                <h2>Frederiks Hospital, 23rd January 1767.</h2>

                ....By gracious permission granted, I take the liberty, in all humility, once more to recall to Your
                Excellency’s attention my brother-in-law, the Chancery Councillor Ericius in Schleswig.¹)
                <br>He stands now at a decisive juncture in his life: whether he shall henceforth live as a country
                gentleman or continue in the service of His Majesty.
                <br>He is reluctant to abandon a career in which he has spent ten years already, and wherein he still
                cherishes the hope of one day serving the King in a more honourable and elevated position, with dignity
                and merit.
                <br>He flatters himself with the thought of having rendered himself as useful as the circumstances would
                allow, and presuming such usefulness, I dare suppose that a man who, in his private affairs, enjoys such
                fair prospects, might thereby seem all the more worthy to be retained in service.
                <br>At present he is dependent upon his father-in-law, who has recently offered to bestow upon him one
                of his tenant farms, yielding at least 1000 Thalers, and to erect a dwelling upon it for his use. My
                brother-in-law cannot reject this offer, nor can he ask his father-in-law to grant him a pension in cash
                to enable him to reside in the city—unless he be presented with more favourable prospects than his
                current supernumerary secretarial post affords.
                <br>Would it, most gracious Lord, be deemed too much if he were to wish for the title of Upper and
                District Court Councillor, with assurance of advancement either as Councillor or Secretary, as
                opportunity may first present itself? That he might, in rank, be placed before those auditors who were
                appointed to the High Court at a later date than he, and in the meantime be employed upon extraordinary
                occasions until a regular post shall open?
                <br>He seeks not to act simultaneously as Councillor and Secretary, but he does wish to be exempted from
                the interrogatory examination.
                <br>Upon the response which Your Excellency may be pleased to grant me depends the declaration now
                required of him by his father-in-law. Should Your Excellency be inclined to approve and support his
                petition, and deem his presence necessary to that end, he is ready to present himself in the spring.
                <br>Your Excellency will pardon the interest I take in this matter, and the service I render to an
                absent brother-in-law whom I hold in personal affection, and whose cause I cannot in good conscience
                forsake...

                <h2>
                    Copenhagen, 19 July 1770.
                </h2>

                ....To His Excellency von Moltke I have submitted a memorial, which, with his recommendation, shall be
                conveyed to Your Highborn Excellency for gracious presentation to His Majesty. It is composed after a
                draft approved by Mr. Conferenzrath Schumacher, which lies in his hands and mayhap hath already been
                shown to Your Excellency. He likewise shall, on his part, support it to the utmost, and shall himself
                speak to His Majesty on the manner in which the matter might be introduced.
                <br>The more I ponder my reasons, the more I dare to hope that Your Highborn Excellency will not merely
                pardon my step but even approve of it.
                <br>I must not longer defer it, but must act now, before the occasion—namely the recent change in my
                station—becomes a thing of the past, whereby I could scarce bring myself to wholly relinquish it. For I
                am verily persuaded that the reasonable and just concern for one’s own fortune, which every man oweth
                himself, imposeth this step upon me, whether it leadeth to the desired outcome or not.
                <br>Likewise, with respect to Count von Moltke, I cannot delay the matter further. He hath at this
                juncture, so to speak, the clearest opportunity to manifest that his desire to promote me is sincere; I
                say at this juncture, for with the dissolution of the Institutum Botanicum, the official bond between
                him and me, as superior and subordinate, is mostly dissolved and remaineth only tenuously through the
                Flora Danica. Such an opportunity will not soon recur, and His Excellency may, both by office and by
                oft-professed friendship, express himself to my benefit.
                <br>Even more important is the moment as concerns Your Highborn Excellency, inasmuch as my memorial, in
                the current course of affairs, doth come into Your hands for royal presentation, thus affording You a
                fair and unbidden opportunity to exercise Your gracious disposition towards me and to act directly for
                my good—something which my removal from Your proper department would not so easily allow at other times
                and under other conditions.
                <br>Also with respect to Mr. Conferenzrath Schumacher and his influence, the present moment, coinciding
                with the King’s journey, seemeth favourable and, in a manner of speaking, critical for me—especially if
                the matter may be arranged such that a favourable resolution might be dispatched for me from the Cabinet
                through him.
                <br>My request is, indeed, no more than just; and in truth it is necessary that I look to my future and
                be secured by such a commission as I now solicit. For otherwise I greatly fear that a hundred vacancies
                might arise without my being placed, and that, standing as I do, isolé, as one whom none know where to
                rank or place, I shall ever stand behind others and never attain a fixed station.
                <br>I submit to Your Highborn Excellency’s gracious discretion whether You might wish to propose a title
                to be conferred upon me. You know how I stand in this matter; my title of Professor was dear and
                honourable to me so long as I held that office—but now that I cease to be one, I cannot quite rid myself
                of a certain discomfort in the designation. His Excellency von Schimmelmann once appeared to sense this
                feeling, and said—unprompted by any word from me—that I must have a title to show that I left the
                professorship with the favour and approval of the King. Yet Mr. Schatzmeister seems to have forgotten or
                abandoned that notion. Truly, in the path I am now to pursue, a title doth not seem entirely
                dispensable, and since I have been Professor since 1754, I might, without undue presumption, expect that
                in lieu of the Present that was once proposed to me on the occasion of my resignation, the title of
                Etatsrath might graciously be bestowed upon me free of charge.
                <br>With His Excellency, Your Honourable Nephew, and the Commerce College, I have reached an
                understanding, and believe I may take up my post on the isle of Aunø at the beginning of the coming
                month. The gracious conduct of Your Nephew awakeneth and commandeth my trust—yet naturally I would first
                open my thoughts to You, my old patron. Count von Moltke is clearly disinclined to see me within the
                Landwesen-Collegium; likewise, Mr. G. R. von Schack seemeth disinclined to take me into the
                Rente-Kammer. Might I then hope that His Excellency, Your Honourable Nephew, would be inclined to admit
                me into his department as a Commissarius within the Zollkammer and the Commerce Collegium?
                <br>As for the Widows' Fund, things stand rather entangled for the Frederiks Hospital. The Danish
                Chancellery hath obtained the War Chancellery's opinion, which declareth that the Hospital Direction’s
                proposal must be postponed until the Commission regarding the Military Widows’ Fund hath concluded its
                work. I shall gladly continue to serve the Frederiks Hospital with my pen, provided it possess strength
                and firmness enough of its own. Otherwise, I would indeed much wish that the gentlemen of the Balance
                Commission might bear me in mind for this matter. ’Tis especially such a business in which I should wish
                to be employed, and I commend myself in this regard to Your Excellency’s gracious remembrance....

                </aside>
                ....Your Highborn Excellency’s gracious letter of the 31st of July from Traventhal was sent to me by His
                Excellency Count von Moltke, though it only came into my hands earlier this week. A letter from Mr.
                Conferenzrath Schumacher dated the 3rd of this month had, eight days prior, already informed me of the
                Royal Resolution obtained on my behalf.¹ I now hasten to discharge the foremost duty of
                gratitude—namely, to express from a deeply moved heart how fully I acknowledge Your Highborn
                Excellency’s untiring and ever-watchful solicitude for my well-being.
                <br>The truest and best proof of my gratitude—given my inability to render services in return—will be
                this: that I, with all my strength, strive in my new career, as in every station of life, to prove
                myself worthy of the advocacy of so illustrious a patron, who hath shown me such a high degree of
                favour.
                <br>Just as the honour of having Your Highborn Excellency for a patron is among my greatest incentives
                to diligence and upright conduct, so too is the assurance of Your continued support my strongest
                encouragement to courage and good hope that I might become useful to the State according to my ability.
                <br>I am of the opinion that the matter of title will find its own resolution. And though I believe that
                both decorum and the present circumstances suggest that one who hath, by gracious favour, been appointed
                to a new career should no longer bear the designation of an abolished office, yet titles and rank are
                the least among the things I would seek anxiously in this world.
                <br>I hope that His Excellency Count von Moltke—who, in this way, continueth to remain my chief, whereas
                otherwise the long-standing relationship between him and me, which hath subsisted for many years, would
                have come to an end—will see to the matter of a title, and more generally to my station. Thus may I, as
                an old servant of the King who hath held no mean office and rank since 1754, remain duly considered, and
                find cause to regard this new position as a true promotion.
                <br>I have written to His Excellency Count von Moltke in such terms as the new situation requireth, and
                I am confident that his recommendation shall not be wanting in this new appearance either.
                <br>May God grant that this noble man shall judge me never otherwise than according to my intentions,
                which are directed to nothing but the good of the State, as it now appeareth to me—without so much as
                the thought of any secondary aims.
                <br>I have been stationed here since the 4th of this month at the post assigned to me by Your Honourable
                Nephew’s Excellency. If circumstances allow me to return to Copenhagen, one of the greatest pleasures I
                shall look forward to will be this: to see You, my patron, in good health and well-being....

                <h2>
                    Copenhagen, 23 November 1770
                </h2>

                ...It was with great pleasure that I learned from His Excellency von Schimmelmann that Your Highborn
                Excellency is in good health and graciously remembers me, so that I may be assured that my respectful
                homage and the news I have to report will not be unwelcome. Would to God that this homage need not be in
                writing and that I might still count Your Highborn Excellency among my supports and
                counsellors—something I now need more than ever.
                <br>The change that has taken place in the Department of Rural Affairs will likely already have come to
                Your knowledge. Yet it may not be superfluous for me to mention the principal points. No one remains
                from the former Collegium in the now-established Commission, save for Mr. Chamberlain Scheel von
                Plessen, Mr. Conferenzrath Schumacher, and the two secretaries, Mr. Justizrat Höjer and Mr. Kanzleirat
                Carstens. Newly joined are myself and Mr. Major Pflug of the Treasury, and the Commission now consists
                of six members, counting the two secretaries as commissioners. The Schleswig-Holstein Land Commission
                retains its constitution and connection with the General Land Affairs Commission.¹
                <br>Its sphere has been expanded by the domains transferred to its administration in the districts of
                Antvorskov and Vordingborg, and otherwise its influence remains as before.²
                <br>Thus I find myself—thanks be to Your Highborn Excellency’s tireless efforts on my behalf, to your
                advocacy and commendations—in an honourable career, in which much good can be accomplished. May God
                grant us His blessing, grant our entire state system consistency, and remove our apprehensions.
                <br>I shall, undeterred by the outcome, which must be left to Providence, do my utmost to advise and act
                according to my best understanding, and, as far as lies in my power, strive to avoid both violent
                measures and inactive conduct. But the circumstances are precarious, and the lack of counsel—such as I
                was sure of in Your Highborn Excellency—is irreplaceable. One comfort is the friendship of Mr.
                Conferenzrath Schumacher; would only that he were not disturbed by the consideration that his own post
                is so precarious.
                <br>Would to God that His Excellency von Moltke had recognised the good intention with which I composed
                my treatise on the peasantry; then what has recently taken place might not have occurred—something
                which, for his sake, grieves me greatly, though I am glad that, since the events at Traventhal, I have
                not taken a single further step in the matter, as Mr. Schumacher knows.³
                <br>As yet, no thought has been given to an improvement of my salary, yet I hope that in time fairness
                will prevail—for surely the labour that falls to me is great, and is increased by additional tasks. Mr.
                Conferenzrath Schumacher has taken it upon himself to make representation to the King that I do not
                deserve to be left in want, since I am held worthy enough to be entrusted with important affairs. I must
                now await the outcome of his attempt. Truly, Their Excellencies von Reventlow and von Schimmelmann ought
                to have done more on my behalf, since the matter lay so near to them and they held the occasion in their
                hands.
                <br>The wish which my daily path and the sight of my patron’s house give rise to—a wish inseparably
                tinged with a certain melancholy—the innermost wish of my heart remains this: that Your Highborn
                Excellency might once again be with us, and, until that may come to pass, that I may hear that Your
                health is preserved...
