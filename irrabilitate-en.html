                    Concerning Oeder’s treatise De irritabilitate.

                <i>
                    <br>Excerpt from “Survey of Denmark’s Zoological Literature”, 1873.
                    <br>
                    <br> Few of the Germans invited at that time exerted a more significant or beneficial influence than
                    Georg Christian Oeder. He was born in 1728 in Anspach and studied under Haller in Göttingen,
                    especially
                    botany. He settled in the town of Schleswig as a physician and was recommended by Count Schmettau to
                    A.
                    C. Bernstorff, when the minister, in 1751, was traveling to Copenhagen to assume his portfolio. On
                    Haller’s recommendation, Oeder was called to Copenhagen to, as professor at the university,
                    establish
                    the study of botany. According to custom, he was required to hold a disputation before assuming the
                    professorship, and on this occasion he wrote a treatise De irritabilitate, in which he—though with
                    some
                    modification—presented his teacher Haller’s new theory concerning muscular irritability. This
                    disputation is more notable due to what occurred at the event itself, which took place on February
                    16,
                    1752, than for its content. Among the audience, Christian Fris Rottbøll, later professor of medicine
                    and
                    at the time a medical student at Ehlers Collegium—much favored by the professors, as the rector
                    wrote in
                    his report to the university patron Count Holstein, "for his profæct. in Philosophiæ og
                    Mathematiciæ"—acted as opponent. The opponent’s remarks, which were rather pointed, did not in the
                    least
                    concern the content of the disputation, but expounded at length on real and supposed negligences in
                    form. Oeder, who doubtless felt that the mood was quite hostile toward him as a foreigner, and whose
                    sound judgment was likely also offended by that such miserable quibblings and stylistic corrections
                    were
                    evidently regarded by the audience as constituting a respectable contribution against his treatise,
                    written in poor Latin but with scientific earnestness, angered him, and he lost his composure to the
                    extent that he even bade Rottbøll be silent. In short, a public scandal arose. Oeder complained to
                    Holstein, and the rector submitted a report, while another was sent in by the medical faculty, to
                    which
                    a brief extract of Rottbøll’s remarks was appended. The entire affair was, in its nature,
                    characteristic; but when one now looks back on Oeder’s later work, one is struck with strange
                    thoughts
                    upon reading how Rector, Justice Councillor, and Professor of Eloquence, Anchersen, after having
                    cited
                    as the “most courteous” what in reality was perhaps the most paltry of Rottbøll’s notable remarks,
                    believes himself justified in exclaiming: “God forgive those who bring us young foreign doctors into
                    this country, who could not even have become students here. Dixi, liberavi conscientiam meam.”
                    (Langebekiana, p. 399).
                    <br>
                    <br>Does anyone now remember Ancheræn? Will the time come when Oeder is no longer remembered with
                    gratitude in Denmark?
                    <br>
                    <br>As is well known, Oeder became royal professor, independent of the university, and established
                    the
                    so-called botanical institute at Amalienborg. In 1754, he became professor at the university, and in
                    1770 he placed the garden under its administration, after which Oeder moved on to other positions
                    and,
                    following the fall of Struensee, was transferred to Oldenburg.
                    <br>
                    <br>This is not the place to elaborate upon Oeder’s great merits in the fields of botany and public
                    administration in Denmark; we shall in the following have occasion to mention his influence on the
                    organization of scientific institutions.

                <br>
                <br> Your High Comital Excellency, Gracious Patron!
                <br>
                <br>My duty and conscience bind me to provide the most exact and truthful account of the dissertation
                and disputation act, which was held in the upper auditorium on the 16th of June, partly in order to
                excuse my own conduct—inasmuch as I, in preserving the jus hospitalitatis, violated the jus academicum
                by two or three times forbidding the Extraordinarius Opponent, when I saw that the Praeses became angry,
                from presenting his arguments—and partly in order to report all circumstances surrounding said
                disputation, to which Your Excellency's high and weighty responsibilities forbid You to descend.
                <br>
                <br>To that end, I immediately had the first Extraordinarius Opponent submit to me his arguments, none
                of which the Praeses would allow him sufficient time to properly develop.
                <br>
                <br>I have found all of them well-founded and have nothing to object to therein, except that he was not
                able to be as brief as he ought. Especially as professor of eloquentia, I have closely examined his
                accusation regarding barbarismi etc., and found it to be crystal clear. As an example, I shall cite a
                few of them.
                <br>
                <br>1) On the title page itself—which, at the very least, ought to be clean—Disceptioni in place of
                Disceptationi is barbaric, and cannot possibly be a printing error, unless the Praeses, as corrector,
                was inexcusably negligent.
                <br>
                <br>2) On the third line of the dissertation, vifurum (he who shall see), instead of videre posse (to be
                able to consider), is one of the grossest errors one can commit; and such errors are manifold. But I
                shall only consider one mistake which the Opponent began to address, but was not permitted to complete,
                even though he protested that he did not consider that particular error to be a grave fault, as it was
                recognizable: Homo machina, for humana machina.
                <br>
                <br>3) His assertion was entirely correct. Humana machina is a miserable and untruthful translation of
                l’homme machine; for even the most orthodox theologian may call corpus humanum a humana machina, but not
                l’homme machine, surely? Homo—that is, totus homo, quoad animam et corpus—is a machine: which I have
                noted in my own copy.
                <br>
                <br>Equally justified were his arguments concerning the metaphysical and logical errors, and the
                Praeses’s refusal to hear them was unfounded, on the grounds that he was a physician; for he who does
                not think or reason correctly can never be a good teacher or doctor.
                <br>
                <br>Nothing was more charming among the many contradictions he had noted against the Praeses than the
                following:
                <br>
                <br>1) On the last line of page six: Baglivianæ opinionis, scio a celebri autore defertam esse permoto
                experimentis, Cc Zinnii — præfens fui — where the Opponent cleverly applied: “You are not 30 years old,
                and you have seen Abraham Baglivi, an Italian physician who died in 170[?].” Now, to be fair, the
                Praeses replied: he meant another author — which I also believe — but the dissertation is written so
                carelessly and miserably that no one could possibly understand it otherwise than the Opponent did.
                <br>
                <br>2) On page 12, the Praeses attempts to refute the author of l’homme machine, which is wretched
                enough and irrelevant to the matter. In the middle of the page, in the second paragraph, he writes:
                Flagitandum ab autore &c., upon which the Opponent had a clever argument: Either Dr. Oeder knows the
                author is dead, or he does not; if he knows it, it is foolish to ask a dead man to do something; if he
                does not, it is an impardonnable ignorance, especially when writing against him. Now, the Praeses did
                respond that one could see from the preface that his dissertation had been written some time ago. But
                unless he truly held us here to be of such a kind as to possess neither eyes, nor understanding, nor
                knowledge, he ought—before sending his dissertation to the press—to have corrected it, if he knew the
                author was dead. This can by no means be passed off as a printing error.
                <br>
                <br>3) Either the Praeses is guilty of the utmost carelessness, or else of the greatest contempt for all
                our learned men: the Opponent was quite right to say: somnians scripsisti. On pages 21 and 23: Tantum
                Addam aliquid de Experimentis, and then he names three renowned men whose experiments he intended to
                discuss—but he does not say a single word about any of them. Instead, he immediately writes: Feci ipse
                &c., which is either writing in a dream, or assuming the reader to be a complete idiot.
                <br>
                <br>Now I truly believe that most of these unpleasant errors arise from the fact that Oeder does not
                know how to express himself — et fari quæ sentiat — least of all in Latin, and that he is entirely unfit
                to be a theoretical teacher, which he nonetheless insists on being, having attempted in vain for about a
                year in Schleswig to make his way by means of practical work.
                <br>
                <br>I have myself attended some hundreds of disputations, even by quite young students, but never heard
                a poorer one. Even if they did not venture to speak much Latin, they would at the very least repeat the
                argument and form the syllogism, asking either to prove the major or minor; but this one was so
                miserable that he dared not request proof of either proposition (for he did not know which was which),
                but merely said: proba quod hoc fit ita &c.
                <br>
                <br>And I am inclined to believe that he understands nothing beyond the poor and miserable kitchen Latin
                which he himself speaks and writes; for he had to admit to me that he had not been able to understand a
                third of Mr. Jensenius’s opposition, especially his sharp ironies against himself.
                <br>
                <br>God forgive those who bring us young foreign doctors into the country, who could not even have
                become students here! Dixi, conscientiam meam.
                <br>
                <br>And I am assured that Your Highborn Excellency will never take it amiss that I honestly write my
                true opinion about a candidate who is disputing while I serve as Rector. And truly, I would not have
                written this had it not been that Dr. Oeder came to me, along with Dr. and Professor Holm and Justitsråd
                Buchwald, to demand retribution against his first extraordinary opponent — yes, recklessly attempted to
                accuse Dr. and Justitsråd Buchwald to his face of having suborned said opponent against him, so that
                Justitsråd Buchwald had to clear himself of it under oath; and I thus feared that he would also seek to
                defame the opponent and us in higher places.
                <br>
                <br>I remain with complete devotion, &c.

                    Eilertz’s Collegium, and is very well regarded for his Profect. in Philosophicis et Mathematicis.

                    <br>G. C. Oeder’s Letter
                    <br>to the Count of Holstein.
                    <br>Copenhagen, 17 February 1757
                </h2>
                Most Illustrious and Most Excellent Count,Most Gracious Lord,
                <br>
                <br>Since my own fortune is at stake, I dare to interrupt Your Lordship’s most weighty affairs with this
                letter, which contains trifles that I myself would deem unworthy not only of Your time but even of my
                own regard—were they not so closely connected to my destiny that they thereby derive their weight.
                <br>
                <br>Since it is my happiness that honorable men judge me to be of some worth, and since many
                distinguished gentlemen in this city have honored me with their friendship, and many noblemen—and You
                Yourself, Most Excellent Lord—have deemed me worthy of Your protection, I dare to hope that even this
                light missive will be received favorably.
                <br>
                <br>I hear that various rumors, various conversations, and differing judgments regarding yesterday’s
                disputation have certainly reached you, my Lord. I have not the slightest suspicion that Your judgment
                could be corrupted; yet it seems to me that many of the things said and done yesterday can be explained
                more accurately by me now than they could be observed at the time, amid the noise in which everything
                took place.
                <br>
                <br>As for the entire method of disputation employed by the student Friis—whom, I confess, I did not
                even know by name beforehand—it seemed to me clearly to be new and quite unlike the practice I have seen
                and known at other universities. And I am far from believing that this is the usual manner at
                Copenhagen. It was plain to all listeners that the intent of the opponent was rather to display his own
                hostility toward me, a foreigner, than to engage in the calm and courteous discourse which I had
                requested.
                <br>
                <br>For I ask, what kind of practice is it to dismiss an entire piece of writing with a single word, to
                condemn in a single breath barbarisms, solecisms, fallacies, and what not, as if my disputation teems
                with all such faults—when in fact the duty of a good opponent is to point out specific errors one by
                one, and not even to name the passages he intends to challenge before the proper time and place has come
                to do so? He who acts otherwise—should he not be judged to have in mind and to follow that proverb:
                “Slander boldly; something always sticks”?
                <br>
                <br>Indeed, in the presence of such listeners and scholars, I should always find it welcome and pleasing
                to be opposed—if indeed modesty adorns the speaker—by any student, even a most learned one, even one
                placed far above my station, who would say to my face: “You wrote as if dreaming.” But to do so surely
                departs utterly from good and courteous manners—without which even the most learned man is an object of
                scorn to all good people.
                <br>
                <br>Since the student Friis presented himself in such a manner, I believed I had every right to refuse
                such an Opponent. I knew full well that anyone may offer contradiction in public disputation—but I also
                knew with equal certainty that one may not lawfully hurl insults.
                <br>
                <br>As for those who, as I hear, deny that I possess any knowledge of Latin—there seem to be such
                people—I truly believe I have every right to laugh, and I say this, I hope, without suspicion of vanity.
                For such a claim is, at best, a trivial compliment, and such a fault—if fault it is—is the lightest of
                defects in a medical text, if it be either such as Celsus himself might have written, or such that it is
                at least evident it was not written by Celsus. Rather, were I vain, I might find grounds for
                self-glorification in this very fact: that while these petty details have been loudly and vigorously
                assailed, the actual content and meaning were scarcely touched at all.
                <br>
                <br>He would blush to say there is nothing new in my writing who is familiar with the medical history of
                recent years, and who is not ignorant of the latest writings—especially those from Leiden—under the name
                of Irritability. I have sent copies of my work to Germany; it is read there, and will also be judged
                there, and I trust envy will have less sway in that place. Aside from many matters of lesser importance,
                my explanation of respiration—whether it be true or false—is certainly new.
                <br>
                <br>Having considered the matter fully, Most Illustrious Lord, I trust that you, being a lover of
                justice and truth, will be indignant at the impotent efforts of certain persons, whose sole cause for
                hatred is that I am a foreigner, and who believe that by means of outcries and rumors they can render
                useless a man whom good and reputable people—even here in Copenhagen—consider to be of use; a man whom
                illustrious and most trustworthy gentlemen have until now deemed not unworthy of their patronage, and
                for whom, I hope, no reason will arise to cause them to think otherwise.

                    Excerpt from the Medical Faculty's (Buchwald's and Lodberg Friis’s) letter to Privy Councillor
                    Holstein dated March 2, 1752.
                </h2>
                As for the evening of the disputation and the two objections raised by the opponents, over which Dr.
                Oeder especially complains — particularly those from Christian Rotbøll Friis — these same oppositions
                are herewith most humbly enclosed as Nos. I and II, the first by Friis and the second by Jensenius. We
                heard no personal insults therein, as they were directed either at the subject matter itself or at the
                style employed. Any presiding scholar must endure such things, and this has often happened to professors
                here at the university, who have accepted it without complaint, for which several examples could be
                given. That one of the opponents, Friis, became somewhat agitated can hardly be held against him, since
                he was treated poorly by the preses and called male motus homo, indeed, the preses even went so far as
                to attempt, propria autoritate, to impose silentium upon him.

                    Rotbøll Fris’s Explanation concerning Doctor Oeder’s Dissertation.
                </h2>

                <br>Scriptum, in quo abest
                <br>I) Persicuitas,
                <br>II) desideratur Ordo,

                <br>IV) cumulantur Errores omnis generis;
                <br>perfectinibus destituitur hoc Scriptum ita. — Ergo:
                <p id="latin">
                    <br>A writing in which
                    <br>I) clarity is lacking,
                    <br>II) order is wanting,
                    <br>III) contradictions are committed,
                    <br>IV) errors of every kind accumulate;such a writing is thus devoid of all perfections. —
                    Therefore:
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                The minor proposition here divides itself into four parts, and in order to be entirely clear — and at
                the same time to preserve order amidst the Author’s disorder — I will present each part syllogistically.
                <br>
                <br>
                Clarity — a writing is said to be clear when it is written in such a way that one who masters the
                language can grasp the author’s intent; if not, it is unclear. Hence the argument:
                <br>
                <br>In scripto, ubi reperietur:
                <br>1. Ἀκυροσόφια,
                <br>2. Barbarismi,
                <br>3. Soloecismi,
                <br>4. Intricata & a linguæ genio abhorrens Constructio,
                <br>5. Qvæstiones, qvæ non resolvuntur;— nulla est Perspicuitas;in hoc scripto ita. — ergo:
                <p id="latin">
                    <br>In a writing in which one finds:
                    <br>1) awkward erudition,
                    <br>2) barbarisms,
                    <br>3) solecisms,
                    <br>4) intricate constructions abhorrent to the spirit of the language,
                    <br>5) questions which are left unresolved;— there is no clarity;so it is in this writing —
                    therefore:
                </p>
                <br>Ἀκυροσόφια. The term vox is attributed to cats on page 22. Yet it is a well-known philosophical
                definition that vox is a Sonus articulatus sensu prolatus (an articulated sound uttered with meaning).
                The best answer I received from the præses was that he distinguished between vox and loquela, and
                asserted that the former could indeed pertain to brute animals, but not the latter. Instead of citing
                any authority in his favor — which was surely his duty as the one employing the term — he demanded that
                I bring along all philosophical writings to convince him. A most reasonable demand from a præses, to be
                sure.
                <br>
                <br>2) Barbarisms. “Disceptio” on the title page. Humana Machina on page 4, agentes on page 13,
                Irregularitas on page 14, Incapacitas on page 13 — these are either neologisms in Latin or outright
                barbarisms. The author may well excuse himself with printing errors, but I fear that there are so many
                of that kind, the entire disputation may be deemed one great printing error.
                <br>
                <br>3) Solecisms. There is no shortage of those. Preface: persuadere, etc. Page 1: me virsurum, etc.
                Page 2: quem dicunt sensus communis. Page 3, section 2. The case usage is so badly altered that one and
                the same word appears in both nominative and ablative with a preposition in the same clause, when one
                attempts to extract the meaning through construction; for it must, without doubt, be construed thus:
                Mercurius efficit ligneas fibras albas a mercurio.
                <br>— which, quite absurdly, has Mercury producing white woody fibers from Mercury. Page 3: Non illud
                urgebo, quod posset — in my opinion, it ought to have been quod possem. Page 2: irritavi. Although more
                could be cited, I consider this sufficient to prove my point.
                <br>
                <br>4) Intricate construction, etc. Page 3, line 4: observavi constanter multum irritata corda, etc., is
                constructed in such a convoluted way that I believe no one who understands Latin could have formulated
                such a sentence. Had the author written: observavi multum irritata corda, aut mica salis tacta, aut soli
                exposita citus definere, etc., one could have understood him at once.
                <br>
                <br>Page 5: a Cogvis seems, based on the punctuation, to relate to agitationes, whereas by meaning it
                must clearly refer to Projectorum.
                <br>
                <br>Page 4, line 12: the author constructs a sentence in such a way that no philologist could derive any
                other meaning than that Steno saw something three hours after he was dead.
                <br>
                <br>I have cited these passages, all of which are æquivoque, and thus unclear. However, the meaning
                could have been made plain with a bit of rearrangement. Since the author has not done this, I must
                conclude either that he could not or that he would not—and since one is to judge in the best light, I
                conclude the former.
                <br>
                <br>Some passages are so lofty that I am not capable of grasping the meaning—especially when, on page 2,
                I read these words: Nam cum ratio & ille, etc., to the end, I was reminded of a wish I read during my
                school days in my Syntax: quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno, quam sapere & fari ut possit, quæ
                sentiat.
                <br>
                <br>I asked many others to see whether the learned fared better than I, but all—even those who were
                Philologi ex professo—admitted that it was to them an insoluble knot.
                <br>
                <br>Preface: Non licuisse proponere etiam impersectam opellam, neque diffteroi.

                <p id="latin">A dainty and intelligible Latin, indeed. From this and many other passages in the
                    disputation, I
                    believe it is clear that the author can scarcely be counted among the autores classici.
                </p><br>
                <br>5)
                Questions, etc. — These can be observed everywhere, but the author might reply that Boerhaave, Haller,
                Hamberg — such great men — have done the same before him; why then should it not be permitted to him?
                But two reasons may be given in response:
                <br>
                <br> These men wrote for their auditores, for whom they had the opportunity to explain themselves more
                clearly in spoken form.
                <br>
                <br>In their works, the preceding paragraphs often contained the reason for decision (ratio decidendi);
                but in his case, it is quite different, since he introduces matters abruptly (ex abrupto).
                <br>
                <br>I am much astonished that several, who follow such great luminaries, do so foolishly that one could
                well apply Horace’s words to them: O imitators, servile herd!
                <br>
                <br>From this I believe it is sufficiently clear that the disputation is anything but clear. Every
                author who does not commit to clarity acts against the very purpose of writing. Clarity is a duty for
                any good writer, all the more so for one who explicitly commits to it and promises to write in such a
                way that everything shall be clear and understandable — indeed, so that it may be comprehended without
                great effort (p. I). Has the author done so? The judgment rests with the readers.
                <br>
                <br>II. In quo scripto Collocationis non est Identitas, in illo non est ordo. In hoc ita, Ergo.
                <p id="latin">
                    II. In a text where there is no consistency in the arrangement, there is no order. Such is the case
                    in this one, therefore [it lacks order].

                </p>
                One judges that there is order when things follow one another according to a certain rule. In the same
                way, I do not consider that library orderly in which folios, quartos, octavos, and duodecimos all stand
                together on the same shelf—because if form is supposed to be the rule, this becomes full of exceptions.
                <br>
                <br>Likewise, if the author’s Irritabilitas is to be the rule (as he claims on page 2: “incipiam...”),
                by which the order of his dissertation is to be judged, I don’t see what pages 12 and 13 (where he
                argues about the author of l’Homme machine and then poses a problematic question) have to do with his
                subject.
                <br>
                <br>He seems afraid we’ll consider him a heretic because he wishes to philosophize mechanically about
                the human body; but does he imagine that’s unheard of in Denmark? Haven’t Boerhaave, Hoffmann, van
                Swieten, and Haller done the same? Are they then recorded in the history of heresy? Are their writings
                not perfectly acceptable here?
                <br>
                <br>Moreover, if I were to act the part of a Consequentarius, I believe one could extract from page 13 a
                Conclusum not very favorable to the author.
                <br>
                <br>Page 11, by the author’s own admission, does not belong in this section (Sed plures, etc.).
                <br>
                <br>Page 14 discusses how the circulation of the blood can be demonstrated by the valves, and then lists
                a sequence of dying body parts – which is hardly related to the main subject.
                <br>
                <br>Page 21: The usefulness of respiration has no proper place here either – why does he not show us the
                usefulness of circulation? The same reasoning applies to similar things.

                    incipiam &c. – “I shall begin, etc.” – implies a formal start the author doesn't follow through.

                It is unfortunate that the bookbinder, who bound the dissertations, has turned the preface into slander
                in all those I have seen, as if he also wanted to contribute to everything being out of order, but this
                should not be attributed to the author.
                <br>
                <br>From my metaphysics, I know that in nature there is never total confusion, and had I not known that,
                I might soon think it could be present here. What name I might best give to the Author’s order, I do not
                know. A certain kind of people, when telling a story, tell everything both loosely and firmly, relevant
                and irrelevant. If I were allowed to coin a term, I would call the order: ordo anilis.
                <p id="latin">ordo anilis-"the order of a confused old woman".
                    <br><br>in rerum natura nunquam detur totalis Confusio-

                <br>
                <br>III. Contradictio.
                <br>
                On page 5, line 22, the author first says that by irritating a nerve he could never bring any muscles
                into motion except those in which that same nerve ended. But immediately thereafter he contradicts
                himself and says: Post nimiam tractationem alicujus nervi, sequitur convulsio universalis. Now it is
                known that convulsio universalis consists in the simultaneous motion of all muscles – so how can the
                first statement possibly be true?

                <P id="latin">
                    Post nimiam tractationem alicujus nervi, sequitur convulsio universalis-
                    "After excessive handling of a certain nerve, a universal convulsion follows."
                    <br><br>convulsio universalis-
                    "universal convulsion (simultaneous contraction of all muscles)."

                </P>
                <br>
                On page 6, line 2, it says: Musculi habent irritabilitatem a nervis, and on page 11, line 2, he says:
                Caro posta extra nexum cum sensorio communi & nervis irritata moveri possit.This directly contradicts
                the former; can one really be expected to believe an author who so frequently contradicts himself?

                <P id="latin">
                    Musculi habent irritabilitatem a nervis-
                    "The muscles derive their irritability from the nerves."
                    <br><br>Caro posta extra nexum cum sensorio communi & nervis irritata moveri possit-
                    " Flesh, once separated from the connection with the common sensorium and nerves, can be moved when
                    irritated."

                </P>

                On page [s], last line, he tells us that Baglivius held an old opinion, which was abandoned by the
                Autore Sententiæ, since he was persuaded by Zinn’s experiments—and Doctor Oeder was present the first
                time these experiments were conducted.
                <br>
                <br>Now, Baglivius died in 1707. Zinn is a recently promoted doctor, and the author himself is not yet
                25 years old. So can one not quite justly (as I said to him when I had the honor of being his opponent)
                say to him what the Jews very rightly said to Christ: “Thou art, etc.”?
                <br>
                <br>It was a poor excuse when he said he didn’t mean Baglivius by “author.” For firstly, he says ejus,
                which can only refer to the preceding noun, namely antiquatæ Baglivianæ opinionis.

                for I take the author of an opinion to be the one who first devised it.

                <br>
                Metaphysics deals with notions. Therefore, if an author confuses notions, he commits an error against
                metaphysics. But on page ..., he considers irritabilitas and stimulus to be synonymous, although they
                are notions that differ toto caelo—that is, entirely—for irritabilitas is the faculty of receiving a
                stimulus. Who cannot see that a receptive faculty and the action being received are distinct? However,
                he can be helped: he might turn stimulus into stimulabilitas, which would look just as wrong as
                irritabilitas. And since concepts are more perfect the more they can designate, and since he regards his
                principle as the universal foundation of all medicine, he could name it stimulabilitas cunque.

                He who draws a conclusion from posse (can be) to esse (is), errs against metaphysics. But his principle,
                according to the definition he himself gives on page 6, line 3, is mere possibility; for the genus in
                the definition is facultas, and facultas is nothing other than possibilitas agendi (the possibility of
                acting). Now, if from that—as from a universal principle—he wants to give a reason (page 7, line 5 and
                page 2: incipiam itaque &c.) for all phenomena in the human body, he is indeed concluding that because
                fibres are irritabiles (irritable), they are actually irritatae (irritated).
                <br>
                <br>Let me make the point clearer: A doctor does not cure the sick because he can be a doctor, but
                because he actually is one. So it is not enough to explain a phenomenon simply by saying that the fibres
                are irritable; for that explains nothing. One must show that there is a ratio sufficiens—a sufficient
                reason—that the irritation has actually taken place. And irritabilitas is, in one word, nothing other
                than what metaphysicians call a conditio prærequisita (prerequisite condition).
                <br>
                <br>On page 6, metaphysics receives yet another slap in the face, for there he argues a non esse ad non
                posse esse (from not being to not being able to be), and thereby seeks to overthrow all of metaphysics
                so that it no longer causes him any trouble. His words are: Cum sint, quæ gradu diverso irritant,
                probabile est, esse posse, quæ irritabilitatem tollunt. The force of the argument is this: Some things
                irritate more, others less—therefore it is probable that there are things that do not irritate at all.
                So far, fine. But then: Since there are things that do not irritate at all, it is likely that there are
                things which prevent the fibres from being irritated.
                <br>
                <br>Some spurs prick more, others less, others not at all—does it follow from this that there are spurs
                which make it impossible for a horse to be pricked? I think not. For that ability lies in the horse
                itself and cannot be taken away: Essentia entis (the essence of being) consists in possibilitas;
                therefore, if possibility is taken away, the essence is destroyed. So whoever asserts that possibilities
                can be removed asserts that the essences of things are changeable, not eternal; and whoever asserts
                this, overthrows nearly all of metaphysics.
                <br>
                <br>By that method, I would have had little hope of becoming a doctor—for according to his way of
                reasoning, it would follow that because I wasn’t one, I could never become one.

                From his replies to my objections, I must conclude that he is not a great lover of metaphysics, since he
                requested a medical but not a metaphysical opponent. But I believe that being a good doctor requires
                more than just writing a Recipie. Nam nil facilius esse potest, quam nosse Elleborum & Theriacum. For
                nothing can be easier than to know hellebore and theriac.

                conclusions from unquestionable premises, organize one’s thoughts properly. In short, in order to think
                rightly, one needs logic and metaphysics. And I do not believe the author thinks anyone can be a doctor
                without thinking.

                <br>
                <br>Logical Errors.To prove the author’s ignorance in logic, it is enough to refer to his definition on
                page 6, line 3, number 1. A definition should be such that it can in all circumstances distinguish the
                definitum from all other things. Now he says: Irritabilitas est facultas fibris muscularibus data. Where
                there is a muscle fiber, according to the definition, there should be irritability – whether the body is
                dead or alive. But in the dissertation, he attributes it only to living bodies. Thus, the definition is
                latior suo definito – broader than the thing it is meant to define.
                <br>
                <br>Furthermore, he says in the definition that muscles are only irritated by bodies that do not always
                touch them. But on page 16, line 15, he says that arteries are irritated by the blood within them – how,
                then, can blood irritate arteries, if it is constantly in contact with them? Therefore, the definition
                is hac in parte strictior suo definito – in this part narrower than the thing it is meant to define.
                <br>
                <br>But there is still one escape: he might say that the blood does not always touch the arteries. But
                then he has Haller (p. 160, l. 129) and the whole medical choir against him; for it is a demonstrated
                truth: incidit in Scyllam, qui vult &c. One could bring forward many false conclusions, but if one were
                to name all the errors contained in this dissertation, one would have a greater task than Hercules had
                in the Augean stables.

                <br>Historical Errors.He does not know that the author of the book L’Homme Machine is dead, even though
                we have long had his epitaph. However, perhaps – since a dead man can apparently see (page 4) – he might

                </p>

                Page 16 the author cites Zencacus, so as not to be accused of plagiarism, but he would have better
                removed this suspicion if he had written in such a way that he could have cited Haller and Luppius.
                Haller in his Lineis Physiologicis has everything that the author has in his dissertation, except the
                errors. Omnia bona sunt Halleri, omnia mala ipsius — everything the author says about irritability,
                Haller says in Lineis Physiologicis. But so that any impartial person may judge, let them open Haller
                from page 193 to 202, and if they find the slightest novelty in the author's dissertation that is not
                contained there, I will lose my case. Yes, I dare believe I can prove even more.
                <br>
                <br>Let us see what actually does not pertain to the matter and what appears new in the author’s work:
                his correction against Boerhave on page 9 ff. is not in Haller on pages 297–299; enough against the same
                man on page 13 can be read in Haller on page 114. About the valves of the heart (valvulis cordis), see
                Haller pages 63–64, how heartbeat and respiration correspond (Haller page 310). The reason why an animal
                does not die immediately, although some tendons are tied, can be seen in Haller on page 95. Yet the
                author says himself in the preface: Dissertationem propono, nil novi, utilisve continentem, and what
                proof do we need if he himself admits it?

                </p>
                Luppius published in Leiden in the year 1748 a dissertation de irritabilitate, which I cannot suppose to
                have been unknown to the author, since Haller in his work published in 1751 reviews this dissertation.
                Now that the author has offered Haller his disputation, it can be nothing else but that he must have
                told him that this matter had been dealt with before. I do not know why he in the preface calls
                Irritabilitas nova regio & regni scientiarum medicarum pars incultior, when Gaubius, Vinter, Luppius,
                Hallerus, and perhaps others have cultivated it. If there is nothing new in the disputation, I do not
                know why he on page 1 says: audeo sperare, aliqua me dicturum, quibus etiam artis peritorum gratiam
                ineam. I could also turn it around and say: audeo dicere, te spe tua excidisse; for how can experts take
                pleasure in reheated food, I will not say twice, but ten times reheated and re-reheated? One could apply
                here Horace’s words: Quid dignum ferat &c.
                <br>
                <br>That the author wrote almost in his sleep, however poorly he could endure it when I presented it to
                him, can besides the contradictions be proved by the last section of the disputation, where he promises
                to tell us something about Heriss, Houth, Brem. experiments, but nothing came of it, and instead he
                tells us about his own experiments, RB., on some kittens. One who now writes a section to demonstrate
                something, and then forgets what he was to show, is so careless that I can hardly consider him awake.
