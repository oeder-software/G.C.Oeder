                of his readers who are more familiar with his person and circumstances to also keep this in mind. He
                wrote them without
                a firm intention to publish them, or at least without the intention to have them appear so soon, solely
                for good
                friends, in moments of leisure, without making it a pressing task to continue. Now, as his current
                profession allows him
                to leave this secondary work behind, he has decided not to fully elaborate these additions to the same
                extent as the

                Nevertheless, or rather precisely because of this, his friends wish him not to withhold this fragment,
                and he has
                consented to hand it over to the press, but entirely unchanged and unedited, just as it flowed from his
                pen during the
                aforementioned months, in the hope that those readers, whose indulgence, like that of his friends, he
                has no right to
                expect, will nevertheless receive it with the same kindness that fair-minded readers generally grant to
                fragments, if
                they contain something useful.

                <h2>
                    On the Title:Freedom and Property.


                </h2>
                Although I do not particularly fear that many readers of my considerations would fail to immediately
                understand these
                words on first glance in the sense that the entire text consistently indicates, I nevertheless wish, for
                the benefit of
                those with whom one must take extra care, even concerning basic concepts, to clarify the meaning of
                these two
                significant words.
                <br><br>
                The freedom of a citizen in the state is the condition in which he, apart from the duties toward the
                commonwealth and
                the authority presiding over it—duties he shares with all other citizens—

                <br> <a id="a6" href="" target=""> 6)</a><br>
                is not subjected to any other obligations or dependency on fellow citizens, except those he voluntarily
                takes upon
                himself. It is a condition in which he can promote and enjoy his well-being in any way that aligns with
                the continued
                existence of the society under whose protection he lives.<br><br>
                The poorest day laborer, who rents out his pair of healthy hands wherever, to whomever, and for as long
                as he sees fit,
                enjoys this freedom. But the farmer, who cannot seek his fortune where and how he wishes, and who is
                confined to the
                narrow bounds of his birthplace, and to whom the choice or rejection of offered conditions is not
                granted, does not
                enjoy this freedom.<br><br>
                By property, I mean here property in the land that the farmer tills—not every kind of property in
                general, not money or
                movable goods.<br><br>
                The freedom as defined above, I demand. The property I do not demand, but only wish for it, and
                according to the
                explanation given on pages 29-30 of the "Bedenken," I deserve to be spared from attacks over words.

                <br> <a id="a7" href="" target=""> 7)</a><br>

                Indeed, there is no danger that the freedom, as defined above, will be confused with unbridled
                lawlessness in theory or
                could lead to such in practice. The bonds of society are in no danger; no one demands the abolition of
                the inevitable
                dependence of every person on another—the higher on the lower, just as the lower on the higher—that
                arises from the
                nature of social life and the needs of people. No one demands to master fate, which distributes the
                fortunes of life
                among mankind in unequal measures. No one demands to take anything from the rich or give the poor more
                than the
                indisputable right to dispose of their own person.
                <br><br>
                This concept of freedom does not change according to the different forms of government—God forbid! The
                very fact that
                this civil liberty is the same in all forms of government, and that under the protection of written
                laws, and with the
                same public enforcement, one can confidently expect the secure enjoyment of this freedom, regardless of
                whether the
                legislative and executive power is

                <br> <a id="a8" href="" target=""> 8)</a><br>
                concentrated in one hand or distributed among several, makes the difference between forms of government,
                in their
                relation to private individuals, fairly insignificant. It means that anyone can live happily in any
                system, as long as
                they are not desirous of a share in governing—a privilege that, even in republics, is only truly granted
                to a few.
                <br><br>

                One cannot simply say that the republican form of government is more favorable to the peasantry, and the
                monarchical
                less so. In fact, it is quite certain that the peasantry is nowhere more oppressed than in Poland, or as
                the Helots were
                in ancient Sparta.

                <h2>
                    Page 5. The question, which I dare to discuss, is a true matter of controversy.

                </h2>
                I am not a fan of polemical writings; rather, my preferred approach, which I would like to maintain
                whenever possible,
                is to present my opinion, which I believe to be true, along with its reasons, of course with
                consideration for opposing
                views and their reasons. However, I strive to separate these views as

                <br> <a id="a9" href="" target=""> 9) </a><br>
                much as possible from the individuals who defend them, without allowing myself the deliberate
                examination and dissection
                of their words. With these sentiments, I am happy to avoid any offered dispute and limit myself to
                self-defense. It is
                solely for the purpose of such self-defense that I address the following passage in "Considerations on
                the Improvement
                of Agriculture in Denmark by a Patriot," Copenhagen 1769, 8vo, pages 19-20, § VII, which reads as
                follows:<br><br>
                "The author of the treatise wants to grant the peasants a degree of independence that could only be
                imagined in the
                freest of states. The only thing missing is that the mere, and according to his plan, insignificant
                titles of counties,
                baronies, and noble estates should cease to exist, and one would be entirely republican."
                <br><br>
                I am sorry that such a courteous man as the author of these considerations could not refrain from using
                an argumentum ab
                invidia (argument from envy). The author of the reflections,

                <br> <a id="a10" href="" target=""> 10)</a><br>
                who has dared to dedicate it to a sovereign monarch, according to your interpretation, my dear sir,
                harbors republican
                principles, and thus hic niger est (this one is black) — isn't that right? And you would like to turn
                inquiries into the
                relationship between landlords and peasants into a crime against sovereignty! So, I had reason to
                mention a word about
                hateful sentiments, and about the despotism of those landlords who argue for the pleasure of ruling over
                fellow
                citizens, as if it were a defense of royal rights! I cannot believe that this twist, which you give to
                the matter, would
                be pleasing to the crowned friend of humanity to whom we both have dedicated our writings.

                As for your concerns regarding the nobility, I refer you to the example of England, and concerning your
                concepts of
                freedom (§ I), which you want to determine according to the form of government, to my previous
                consideration.

                But I demand that one also refrains from general accusations of poor

                <br> <a id="a11" href="" target=""> 11)</a><br>

                management, laziness, stubbornness, and rebelliousness of the peasant class in general. The peasants
                are, at least in
                their natural disposition, people like all other people, with equal abilities, passions, and feelings;
                only their
                abilities are less developed, their passions manifest in a coarser manner, and their feelings are not
                refined. It is the
                highest degree of injustice to blame oppressed people for the very consequences of their oppression, and
                it is
                impossible to hear such general accusations without disgust, especially those made against the peasants
                of Zeeland. If
                the current generation were truly so poorly constituted, it would first have to be determined where the
                blame lies, and
                then it is no consequence that future generations will be the same and must be so.

                Especially for a state like Denmark, whose borders are determined by nature, the boundary between the
                Baltic Sea and the
                North Sea is as clear as the boundary between Norway and Sweden, thus it must seek its expansion

                and strengthening through the improvement of its internal structure. Given the fortunate situation of
                these countries
                and the mostly good soil in Denmark and the principalities, further population growth with its
                beneficial consequences
                is very possible. This expansion of the population must begin with the peasant class and be sought
                through the
                improvement of the constitution of this class.

                government. This
                class should have a surplus of hands available for urban sustenance, but for its increase, more places
                for new families

                    Page 10. The Categories of the Peasant Class.
                </h2>

                I have particularly enjoyed noting, amidst the favorable judgments of my friends about my writing, that
                they have
                recognized the intention behind this classification, which I have submitted for printing, namely to
                establish specific
                terms regarding such a complicated subject, which has drawn the public's attention.<br><br>
                These categories can be further nuanced and specified, and I find it particularly necessary to expand
                the sixth
                category. In fact, two categories should be created from it, which, like the fourth and fifth, differ in
                duration,
                namely: <br>

                <br> <a id="a14" href="" target=""> 14)</a><br>

                a) Leasehold for a lifetime, or at will, without labor services, against payments, and <br>
                b) As stated under No. 6: Heritable lease without labor services, against payments.<br><br>

                Um aber der Aenderung der Zahlen überhoben zu seyn, mögen diese beyde Stuffen die gemeinschaftliche No.
                6. behalten, und
                nur durch a und b unterschieden werden.

                However, in order to avoid changing the numbers, these two categories may retain the common No. 6 and
                only be
                distinguished by a and b.<br><br>
                The second category is the status of the peasant class in Schleswig and Holstein, namely that part of
                this class that is
                subject to the landowner, which is the part generally referred to in this entire classification, not
                those peasants or
                countryfolk who independently own their farms, entirely free from other estates, and are direct subjects
                of the prince.
                The third category includes the status of the lease peasants, that is, tenant farmers in Denmark, since
                the decree of
                Frederick IV dated February 21, 1702.<br><br>
                The fourth category shall be achieved through the ordinance issued by the General Land Management
                College


                <br> <a id="a15" href="" target=""> 15)</a><br>
                on May 6, 1769, regarding the determination of labor services.
                <br><br>
                The sixth category in its first nuance a, and not merely for life, is the status of farmers in England,
                as well as the
                peasants in Norway, who inhabit no own but leased farms, or as it is called there, bygslede farms, yet
                in these cases
                always for life.

                <h2>
                    Further Specification of the Status in the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein

                </h2>

                The peasant, along with his family, is a serf who cannot leave his service.
                To this serf, the landowner provides a farm, a piece of land with an accompanying dwelling and
                equipment, so that he can
                farm it for himself and sustain himself from it, and in return, he demands services, sometimes certain
                products, rarely
                money.
                <br><br>

                The services are not limited by any contract but left to the reasonable discretion of the landowner. The
                mode of
                performance concerning field cultivation is that the service is determined in days, with a specified
                number

                <br> <a id="a16" href="" target=""> 16)</a><br>
                of horses and people, but the landowner or his steward or tenant allocates the service to the place
                where he sees fit.
                The contribution from the estate to the sovereign or land tax is paid by the landowner for the entire
                estate,
                considering the lord's land and the peasant field as a whole. The peasant field is not assessed
                separately, and the
                sovereign has nothing to do with the peasant, as he is merely a servant of the landowner.
                <br><br>
                The landowner derives his income, insofar as agriculture is the source, from the products of his lord's
                land, and either
                administers this himself or leases it out. Most of the time, the use of grain cultivation and the
                livestock farming of
                cattle, which consists of dairy herds, is especially leased out, and the use of dairy herds is usually
                calculated for
                half the yield of the estate.
                <br><br>
                The lord's land constitutes at least as much in area as the peasant land, but on most estates, it is
                more, regarding
                which, in the absence of commissioned,

                <br> <a id="a17" href="" target="">17)</a> <br>
                at least known, measurements, no proportions can be accurately given. Moreover, no landowner can manage
                with just the
                unfree services without completely oppressing the peasants; he must also maintain his own wagon and plow
                with paid
                servants for the extensive farming and management, and they would not manage even if they were to
                cultivate more land
                and not leave so much to pasture.

                <h2>
                    Further Specification of the Constitution in Denmark.

                </h2>
                Through Frederick IV's decree of February 21, 1702, serfdom and glebe adscription have been abolished in
                Denmark,
                although they previously existed only abusively and never de jure. This is a significant change for the
                state, which
                will be remembered for the eternal glory of this monarch in history, just as the mention of it is a true
                ornament of his
                tomb in the burial place of the kings at Rothschild.
                <br><br>
                The Danish tenant farmer is therefore a free man, a tenant who inhabits a fine estate, according to a
                contract issued by
                the landowner,

                <br> <a id="a18" href="" target=""> 18)</a><br>

                a lease agreement, under which his free consent is presumed, without the right to say no, because
                without this right,
                freedom and contract are empty words.<br><br>
                That the young farmer is bound to his birthplace, Fødestavn, for certain years of his life stems from
                royal provisions
                regarding the national militia, as the provision of capable soldiers by the landowners is required
                according to a canon
                established by the matriculation system, which demands one man for every 40 tons of hard corn.
                Therefore, this right to
                keep their young men together must be granted. If this right, in practice, leads to a limitation of the
                farmer's
                freedom, it is merely an abuse that contradicts the intention of the legislator.
                <br><br>
                All land in Denmark (except for the large heaths in Jutland) has been measured and assessed through
                royal arrangements
                and is subject to land tax according to these measurements and assessments. Each tenant farmer knows the
                size of his
                estate and pays the land tax himself; however, the king

                <br> <a id="a19" href="" target="">19)</a> <br>
                relies on the landowner in the case of the farmer's negligence.<br><br>
                The farmer also pays his own tithe, which is divided into three parts: one for the king, one for the
                local preacher, and
                the third designated for the maintenance of the churches. Therefore, these three tithes are referred to
                as the king's
                tithe, the preacher's tithe, and the church's tithe.<br><br>
                In addition to the labor services that the farmer performs for the landowner, he also pays the landowner
                a fee known as
                "land rent," usually 1½ thaler per ton of hard corn.<br><br>
                The labor services have thus far been unlimited and left to the discretion of the landowner according to
                will and
                custom; however, according to the aforementioned regulation, they should now be legally defined. The
                previously common
                mode of performance was that the farmer was assigned a certain plot of land to cultivate, essentially a
                certain quota,
                without a determination of time; however, the aforementioned regulation focuses on regulating the labor
                services
                according to time and the number of hands and teams.


                <br> <a id="a20" href="" target="">20)</a> <br>
                A complete noble estate consists of 200 tons of hard corn arable land, in addition to and beyond the
                main estate.<br><br> For a
                barony, it is 1000 tons of hard corn.<br><br> For a county, it is 2500 tons of hard corn. A noble estate
                has its main estate, a
                barony additionally has 100 tons of arable land, and a county has 300 tons of arable land exempt from
                contributions. The
                noble estates established before 1661 are also exempt from tithes regarding their main estates. The
                terms
                “contributable” and “exempt hard corn” are used.<br><br>
                On the manor of a complete noble estate, besides the mentioned exemptions from land tax and tithes, the
                following rights
                or so-called sædegaards are attached:<br><br>
                Freedoms: hunting rights, jus patronatus (the right to appoint clergy), exemption from service in the
                national militia,
                from police duties, the right to brew beer and distill spirits for home use, and to fatten oxen, etc.
                <br><br>

                All sædegaarde or noble estates in Zealand amount to 10,207 tons of hard corn, while the contributable
                arable land
                amounts to 103,000 tons of hard corn, from which the land of the free farmers or landowners must be
                deducted, although
                there are not many of them. In Jutland, according to the Atlas Daniæ,



                <br> <a id="a21" href="" target=""> 21)</a><br>

                the manorial land is in proportion to the arable land of the fästebauer, as 2:17. If this proportion is
                actually
                maintained and not altered by the unlawful enlargement of the manorial land through the elimination of
                the fästehöfe,
                which has indeed gradually occurred against royal orders in many places, the landowners at some
                locations have
                unnecessary frohndienste (forced labor) for their own use. For this reason, there are many landowners in
                Jutland who
                relieve some of their frohnbauern, especially those living far from the manor, of their forced labor in
                exchange for
                service fees, reserving only a few services for extraordinary occasions.

                <h2>
                    Some remarks on what the comparison of the situation in the duchies and the kingdom gives cause for.

                </h2>
                In Denmark, much more has been done towards the perfection of the constitution of the peasant class than
                in the duchies,
                and the further progress is infinitely more difficult in the latter than in the former. There, the
                peasant is a serf,
                whereas in Denmark he is a free tenant, and also in this regard, he

                <br> <a id="a22" href="" target="">22)</a> <br>

                is closer to the status of other subjects of the landowner, as he is assessed for land tax himself.
                In the duchies, the manorial land constitutes half of the land that makes up an estate, while in Denmark
                it comprises
                approximately one-eighth. Therefore, since the noble estates constitute a large part of the land, a
                significant
                difference in population must follow from this. In Denmark, seven-eighths are occupied by many peasant
                families, whereas
                in the duchies only four-eighths are. Even if one considers the family of the landowner with as many
                servants and
                attendants as one wishes, it certainly does not compare to the number of inhabitants living in Denmark
                on the three
                excess eighths.

                <br><br>
                Here’s the translation of the provided text into English and Danish:
                English Translation:
                For this reason, the extraordinarily higher price of estates in Schleswig compared to estates in
                Denmark, of the same
                size and quality, becomes understandable, as it usually exceeds the previous amount and goes up to three
                times that.
                Although in Schleswig the landowner pays the land taxes, which in Denmark the peasant holds, and does
                not enjoy the land
                rents or land dues

                <br> <a id="a23" href="" target=""> 23)</a><br>

                as the proprietor in Denmark does from his peasants, the total does not come close to the yield of
                three-eighths of the
                whole estate, which the Schleswig proprietor claims over the one-eighth to which the Dane restricts
                himself.
                To the proprietor, who determines and applies his capital according to the yield, an estate in Schleswig
                is certainly
                worth more; however, it is not worth more to the state, and there can be no clearer example to
                illustrate how often the
                yields of the state and private individuals differ. Thus, I do not wish to criticize the Schleswig
                proprietors for
                utilizing their estates and associated capital according to local customs, nor do I demand sacrifices
                for the state; I
                simply state that, for this reason, the constitution of land use in Denmark is indeed better than in the
                duchies and
                that further improvements expected from the dissolution of noble estates can be more easily anticipated
                in Denmark.
                Furthermore, those who extol Holstein's economy should take a bit more consideration for the state.


                <br> <a id="a24" href="" target="">24)</a> <br>
                The illegal dissolution of peasant estates on many properties in Denmark, despite prohibitions against
                it, is an
                approach towards the Schleswig-Holstein constitution.<br><br>
                According to the calculations I will present later, one ton of arable land (Hartkorn) is worth as much
                to the landowner
                as a capital of 370 Rthlr., while one ton of peasant land is worth only 38 Rthlr. If he can dissolve one
                ton of peasant
                land and convert it into lordly land while simultaneously compelling or persuading the peasant farmers,
                from whom this
                ton has been taken away, to cultivate this ton along with the old lordly land, he profits by 332 Rthlr.
                If we deduct 75
                Rthlr. for the contributions he then has to take on himself, he still profits by 257 Rthlr.

                <h2>
                    Explanation of the terms "plow" and "ton of arable land."

                </h2>

                The terms "plow" in the duchies and "ton of arable land" (Hartkorn) in Denmark are designations of units
                based on which
                the

                <br> <a id="a25" href="" target=""> 25)</a><br>

                land registry of properties and plots is established. Both units are composed of the concept of area and
                quality.
                <br><br>
                During the measurement conducted throughout Denmark from 1681 to 1687, which serves as the basis for the
                new land
                registry, the following method was observed in Jutland and, with some changes that are not essential for
                our
                understanding, in the other provinces: arable land or plow land was geometrically measured, and 14,000
                Zealand square
                ells were calculated for one ton of sowing. It was divided into six classes based on its quality,
                namely: 1) the very
                best soil or land. 2) good soil. 3) medium land. 4) poor land. 5) bad land. 6) the very worst type of
                land. Accordingly,
                based on the order of these classes, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 tons of sowing, that is, 28,000, 56,000, 84,000,
                126,000,
                168,000, 224,000 square ells were calculated for one ton of arable land.
                Meadow land was measured according to the presumed yield of hay in cartloads, dividing the hay into four
                classes: 1)
                marsh hay, 2) good meadow hay, 3) heath, swamp, or forest hay, 4) hay from moors


                <br> <a id="a26" href="" target="">26)</a> <br>

                or heaths; and 10, 16, 24, 32 cartloads of hay were calculated for one ton of arable land.
                Pastures were divided into three classes: 1) good, 2) medium, and 3) poor pastures, calculated based on
                the number of
                cattle that could graze on them, and 24, 32, 40 cattle were calculated for one ton of arable land.
                Forests were measured
                based on their capacity for pig fodder, estimating 24 pigs for one ton of arable land. Other luxuries
                and appurtenances,
                e.g., fisheries, were assigned to arable land according to the judgment of those permitted to assess.
                <br><br>

                One can easily understand that from the land registry of a farm, when one hears that it is assessed for
                so many tons of
                arable land, one cannot form any concept of its geometric size, since the different data from which the
                total tons of
                arable land arise are unknown and have been merged into one.
                It is also easy to grasp that already at the time of measurement, a lot of arbitrary factors, both
                intentional and
                unintentional, could have influenced the estimation, and that even more circumstances on each farm could
                have


                <br> <a id="a27" href="" target="">27)</a> <br>

                significantly changed over time due to neglect, improvements, and worldly events. Thus, it is no wonder
                that currently,
                after so many years have passed, one finds the land registry of various whole regions and individual
                locations to be
                very uneven.<br><br>
                From the comparison of geographical distances with the land registry, the following tons of arable land
                correspond to
                one geographical square mile:<br><br>

                In Denmark overall, the following are the born per square mile:<br><br>
                Overall: .............40.70<br>
                In Zealand’s Stift:.. 57.100<br>
                In Funen’s Stift: ....52.91<br>
                In Jutland: ..........26.45<br>
                In Schleswig: ........45.79<br><br>
                Thus, the respective populations are in the same ratio as the numbers listed in the second position.
                In Zealand, there are 356 parishes in the countryside over 115 square miles. In Funen, there are 174
                parishes over 53
                square miles. In Jutland, there are 952 parishes over 423 square miles. In Schleswig, there are 201
                parishes over 166
                square miles.
                <br><br>
                When comparing the population of Zealand, Funen, and Jutland with their matriculation assessments, two
                assumptions can
                be made. On one hand, that the population corresponds to the products and means of livelihood, and on
                the other hand,
                that a reasonable land tax should correspond to the fertility and products of the land.

                <br> <a id="a29" href="" target="">29) </a><br>

                Moreover, considering that in these countries the peasant makes up a significantly larger proportion of
                the population,
                it follows that the population is more based on agriculture and less on industry. Thus, the relationship
                between sources
                of nourishment and land taxes is approximately balanced, indicating that the land taxes are generally
                quite reasonable.
                Furthermore, Jutland is more densely populated than Zealand, and Zealand is more densely populated than
                Funen.<br><br>
                The increase in population in Jutland, exceeding the ratio of land taxes, likely arises from the fact
                that in this
                country, where industry and urban sustenance are particularly low, many previously uncultivated areas
                may have been
                brought into cultivation since the land measurement. Overall, the poorer provinces and regions, which
                have been
                generously allocated land for hartkorn for this reason, seem to be faring better than the more fertile
                ones because, in
                those poorer regions, the potential for further improvement is greater than in the fertile ones.
                <br><br>
                Another reason for the relatively higher population in Jutland is certainly also the larger number of
                freeholders or
                self-owning farmers.

                The Duchy of Schleswig contains 165.5 square miles, and its number of plows is 10,630, which means there
                are 64 plows
                per square mile. Denmark contains 644 square miles, and the number of tons of hartkorn is 371,280,
                resulting in 576 tons
                per square mile. Consequently, on average, one plow corresponds to about 9 tons of hartkorn. Since a
                plow pays 28 Rthlr,
                and a ton of hartkorn is approximately 3 Rthlr, these contributions essentially equate to one
                another.<br><br>
                The domain estate Satrupholm covers 0.75 square miles and accounts for 79 plows: that gives 105 1/3
                plows per whole
                mile.<br><br>
                When the county of Reventlau was established, instead of the 300 tons of hartkorn that a county in
                Denmark has, 21 5/6
                free plows were granted, which equates to one plow for 13 97/132 tons of hartkorn.<br><br>
                In Schwansen and Danish Wold, which together amount to 6,570 square miles, there are 540 plows,
                resulting in 80 2/3
                plows per mile.<br><br>
                One square mile contains 144 million square ells, thus 10,285 6/7 tons of arable land


                <br> <a id="a31" href="" target="">31)</a> <br>
                or geometric tons, each consisting of 14,000 square ells. Zealand has 964 tons of hartkorn per square
                mile. A ton of
                hartkorn consists of various types of land, not only measured plowland but also unmeasured meadowland,
                pastures, and
                woodland areas, and at least one third of the total area comes from this unmeasured land; at most, two
                thirds of the
                area comes from the measured plowland.<br><br>
                Now, if we consider this plowland as average in quality, so that for every 2/3 ton of hartkorn there are
                4 tons of
                arable land, the usable plowland of all 964 tons of hartkorn would amount to only 3,856 tons of sowing.
                Thus, in Zealand
                as a whole, the usable plowland would relate to the total area approximately as 6:17, meaning it
                constitutes just over a
                quarter of the whole, with the remaining three quarters accounting for meadows, pastures, forests,
                lakes, swamps,
                settlements, and roads. In a country like Zealand, which has no heaths but rather has arable land
                everywhere, this is by
                far too much and shows the clear possibility of much further cultivation.

                </h2>
                Among all these states, Great Britain serves best as an example for Denmark and the duchies, due to the
                similar location
                in and by the sea, the similar nature of the soil with a slight difference in climate, and the similar
                foundation of the
                state economy, which in both kingdoms is based on agriculture and livestock.

                <br><br>
                In Great Britain, forced labor and all forms of personal subjugation have been abolished by
                parliamentary acts, in
                England at least in the year 1660, in Scotland after the last rebellion. Since there are no forced labor
                services, there
                are also no large estates, for one follows from the other. Instead, a landowner divides his estate into
                larger or
                smaller farms, keeps one near his residence for his own household, mostly as grassland, rarely as arable
                land, and
                leases the others at any price that he and his tenants, all free people, can agree upon, for a certain
                number of years.

                <br> <a id="a33" href="" target="">33)</a><br>
                The tenant has no other people at his disposal for the operation of the farm besides his family, except
                those he hires
                for money, servants whom he employs, and day laborers for the extraordinary work that occurs only at
                certain times. Such
                day laborers, also on the same level as tenants, live in large numbers throughout the countryside, and
                all landowners
                take care of their accommodation.
                <br><br>
                Now, without peasant serfs and large estates, Great Britain, especially England, is in a flourishing
                condition, at least
                in terms of agriculture, and the complaints about the decline of the food supply only concern urban
                food. It has a
                respected and wealthy nobility that lives in splendor and pleasure on their estates. It produces all the
                desirable
                products of agriculture, farming, and livestock in abundance, grains, from which it has been able to
                export about £1.5
                million worth, except for the last few years, butter and cheese, oxen and sheep, and horses.

                <br><br>

                <br> <a id="a34" href="" target="">34)</a><br>

                All of this is known to everyone among us, and yet it is constantly said, what will become of the
                nobility when the
                large estates decline? Where will the products for export come from to bring money into the country?
                What about the
                Dutch farms, oxen fattening, stud farms, etc.? I have only one answer for those who would like to deny
                the possibility
                of a better condition of land management without large estates, namely, that I refer them to the example
                of England, and
                indeed it is not worth the effort to engage in more detailed discussions when a predisposition shows
                that one refuses to
                admit anything.
                <br><br>
                I do not like to refer to Norway with regard to the Danes and Holsteiners, because the natural
                differences between the
                countries are too great, and agriculture does not constitute the actual basis of the national economy in
                Norway. The
                landowners in Norway who own land or invest capital in it do not look as much to arable farming as they
                do to other
                properties and benefits, particularly the use of forests.


                <br> <a id="a35" href="" target=""> 35)</a><br>

                However, it is certain that agriculture in Norway is pursued with more economy and diligence than in
                Denmark and the
                principalities, and that arable land compared to arable land, in Norway the scattered, little
                interconnected small plots
                of arable land and meadows yield a proportionately greater return than the extensive fields in Denmark
                and the duchies.

                As long as this lease or tenancy is not a proper contract between both sides’ free and unbound parties,
                the farmer will
                never achieve the freedom granted and determined by the king; instead, his condition remains precarious,
                and especially
                the provisions regarding the national militia can be abused to undermine the farmer's freedom.<br><br>
                As long as large estates remain in their structure, servile duties are indispensable.<br><br>
                As long as these estates exist in their current form, at least those families who would find a place on
                the parcels

                <br><br>
                As long as the dwellings of the peasants are leasehold properties and not their own residences, no
                increase in these
                dwellings can be expected, as the advantage to the landlord, who is to build and maintain them, entails
                that there can
                only be as many as are absolutely necessary for the operation of agriculture as it has been
                traditionally practiced.

                <br> <a id="a37" href="" target="">37)</a> <br>

                As long as the farmers are tenants and not owners, they lack the motivation that an owner has, who looks

                for the benefit of his family beyond his own days.<br><br>
                As long as, on the one hand, the landlords, who rarely manage their estates themselves, have more at
                their large estates
                than they can oversee and maintain, and on the other hand, their leasehold farmers are necessarily
                required to remain
                within the prescribed bounds, significant and extensive improvements in agriculture cannot be
                contemplated, nor can one
                think of various useful speculations regarding the cultivation of land, the culture of countless still
                unusual crops,
                tree farming, or livestock breeding, which can only occur where land is occupied by farmers who have
                free rein and among
                whom there are many who, while they are above the poverty of the common farmer, still seek their fortune
                in agriculture
                and must make it their primary occupation.

                In a word, one cannot expect that the land will be cultivated in the most beneficial manner for the

                <h2>
                    Page 6. Population

                </h2>

                I have said it before, and I repeat it: Norway is, in my opinion, more densely populated in terms of
                arable land
                compared to Denmark. One must have seen Norway, or similar mountainous countries, to truly understand
                how the arable
                patches constitute such a small part of the land. Those who are unfamiliar with Norway should take a
                look at Mr.
                Essendrop’s description of the parish of Lier and compare his chart and description. The inhabitable
                part of this parish
                consists of a valley that is 2 miles long and between 1/4 and 1/2 mile wide; it is inhabited by 500
                families and at
                least 3,500 souls, and it provides for 64 cavalrymen and 80 infantrymen.

                <br> <a id="a39" href="" target="">39)</a> <br>
                Now, if we take this valley as entirely 3/8 of a mile wide, its area would amount to 3/4 of a Norwegian
                square mile, or
                75/64 of a Danish square mile, and consider this entire space as arable land—which is indeed too much to
                claim—then we
                arrive at 2,986 souls per Danish square mile. Where in Denmark or the duchies is there such a densely
                populated area,
                except perhaps the islands of Föhr or Fehmarn?<br><br>
                The number of births in the Aggerhuus parish and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, combined, is in
                the ratio of
                105:131.<br><br>
                Denmark, at least the islands, is more densely populated than the duchy of Schleswig, as can be seen
                from the
                above-mentioned birth figures per square mile. And if we consider that the cities in these duchies are
                larger than the
                rural towns in Denmark, the difference in population concerning the flat land becomes even more
                significant, and this
                difference can stem from nothing other than the condition of the peasant class.



                <a id="a40" href="" target=""> 40)</a><br>

                I am further convinced that the northern part of the Duchy of Schleswig is more densely populated than
                the southern
                part, and Schleswig is apparently more populated than Holstein, considering flat land against flat land,
                particularly
                since the common districts in the Duchy of Holstein seem quite barren to me. However, I lack sufficient
                records of
                births and deaths for the cities and for the flat land in particular to make a sufficient
                calculation.<br><br>
                Mr. Hansen states in his new state description of the Duchy of Schleswig on page 509 that the beautiful,
                fertile,
                entirely noble area of Dänischwold, which is 3,400 square miles large, has 6,000 souls, which would be
                1,764 per square
                mile. For the island of Fehmarn, which contains 2,802 square miles, he attributes 8,500 souls, which
                would be 3,035 per
                square mile. Fehmarn has 231 births annually, which would yield 36 living individuals for each birth,
                which is likely
                too much.

                </h2>

                Many writers are inclined to believe that in a truly flourishing state, a farmer can live alongside a
                townsman, and all
                can be sustained by the products of the land without external supply. However, let us assume the ratio
                between these two
                main classes of people, those who live from agriculture and those who live from various trades, as
                Davenant indicates
                for England, with a total of 5,545,000 people, in the ratio of 4:3, so that the farmer or peasant class
                constitutes
                four-sevenths of the nation.
                If it should come to pass that a class of people, which so far constitutes three-quarters of the nation,
                without
                increasing or decreasing, should no longer exceed four-sevenths, then the nation as a whole must
                increase by 5/16, and
                thus, if it was a million strong, it must grow to 1,312,500. However, an increase of 312,000 people in
                the industrial
                class is impossible without a simultaneous increase in the number of farmers,

                <br> <a id="a42" href="" target="">42)</a> <br>

                so it would surely have to be the case in Denmark that, assuming the population is currently one
                million, it would have
                to reach at least one and a half million before things were at a standstill, as stated by Davenant in
                England.

                This principle for establishing the measures by which the population is to be promoted cannot be

                This care is
                owed to humanity; every member of the state has the right to expect the authorities to show concern for
                the weaknesses
                of human nature, and surely the trust in a just,

                <br><a id="a43" href="" target="">43)</a> <br>


                kind, and cautious authority greatly contributes to the population of a state. However, I would rather
                praise all such
                police institutions for this better reason than for the selfish state reason of population and the
                strength of the state
                that arises from it, for I truly do not believe they contribute much. The Lord of Nature has established
                stronger
                provisions for the preservation of the human race than humans can make, and the power of procreation is
                far superior to
                the ordinary occurrences of human life, quickly filling the gaps that arise from those misfortunes. This
                very power also
                swiftly occupies the places that open up with a new or an old extended food supply. Therefore, let the
                identification
                and arrangement of the food supply be the primary concern, and do not begin by seeking out the people to
                whom it will be
                assigned. Just as surely as the water flows down from the mountain, so surely will the gathered people
                disperse again if
                the proposed food supply fails, and it is all too difficult to separate the contribution of the
                government,

                <br> <a id="44" href="" target="">44)</a> <br>

                which can only last for a while, from the productivity of the food supply in itself at the first
                appearance of a good
                outcome. Just as certain is the emigration of the inhabitants, which is lamented so much on the coasts,
                as a sure proof
                that the food supplies in the country cannot be sufficient enough. Therefore, one must be attentive to
                new sources of
                food, and a great opportunity opens up through the division of large estates with abolished servitude.

                </h2>
                In Denmark, there are approximately 600 noble estates with about 33,000 tons of hard grain, resulting in
                approximately
                55 tons of hard grain per noble estate on average, with the difference varying by province. In Zealand,
                there are about
                90 tons, in Funen 51, in Lolland 66, and in Jutland 45 tons of hard grain per estate on average. If we
                now consider that
                in the division each estate is allocated 11 tons

                <br> <a id="a45" href="" target="">45)</a><br>
                for its own use and from the remaining 44 tons, or 11 portions of 4 tons of hard grain, we form one
                estate with 3
                portions, two with 2 portions, and four ordinary simple freeholds with only one portion, we would have 8
                families
                instead of one on each estate. Thus, for 600 estates, we would have 4,200 places for new families, some
                of which would
                be considerable families, as 2 and 3 portions of noble land already provide living spaces for well-off
                families.

                If the old saying attributed to Hesiod, that half is more than the whole, holds any truth, it can be
                applied to
                agriculture. I consider 4 tons of hard grain sufficient for a farm, especially after the abolition of
                forced labor, but
                I would gladly concede that 6 tons of hard grain is the best measure. However, throughout the kingdom,
                there are a large
                number of tenant farms with between 8 to 10 tons of hard grain, from which new farms would certainly
                arise through
                division, even more so through the separation of some tons

                I have allowed 6 tons of hard grain for a farm, but I do not find it necessary; I can refer to the
                example of Samsøe,
                where most residents live quite well with between 1.5 to 3 tons of hard grain.

                This can be observed in Bornholm, where approximately 18,000 people live on 10 square miles, and where
                there are no
                villages in the countryside, but rather isolated farms, so that each farm has its field surrounding it.
                The back of the
                island is occupied by the so-called Alminding, which is a heathland. Since Christian VI sold his rights
                to a large part
                of the farms that were until then tenant farms for a considerable sum in 1744,

                <br><a id="a47" href="" target="">47)</a> <br>

                thus making these tenant farms into individual freehold farms, the owners of the farms adjacent to the
                Alminding have
                gradually made some of the nearest and most convenient patches of heathland arable from year to year,
                and they continue
                to do so, particularly through the so-called householders or cottage dwellers, of whom often 6 to 15
                families can reside
                on one farm, and whose increase is greatly favored by the owners of the farms. A similar gradual
                improvement of the
                heathlands can also be expected in Jutland and the duchies if, first, the structure of the peasantry
                makes such an
                expansion of the growing families possible.

                </h2>
                Anyone who has taken a look at the new economic writings, especially those of the French, will have
                found an opportunity
                to notice how prone people are to shift from one opinion to the directly opposing one. Indeed, the
                advocates of
                agriculture tend to fall into a declamatory tone and believe that they have not praised it sufficiently
                unless it is at
                the expense of urban trade, so that one has reason to emphasize the reminder that agriculture, by itself
                and without
                significant encouragement from urban trade, always remains far below the level that the soil and climate
                otherwise
                permit.


                <br> <a id="a49" href="" target=""> 49)</a><br>
                I have already mentioned Norway a couple of times and will have to say more about it, and I would like
                to ask permission
                to use Norway as an example to illustrate my thoughts on the connection between these two main branches,
                even if what I
                am about to say may seem like a digression.
                <br><br>
                I say, therefore, that in my opinion, agriculture in Norway is pushed as far as it can go by itself: it
                is undoubtedly
                capable of many further improvements, but only under the influence of a more extensive urban trade,
                which is undeniably
                lacking in this sprawling country. It has no cities except along the coast, and even there, no further
                than Trondheim,
                none for the vast stretch of the untouched northern lands, no towns except for the two mountain towns of
                Kongsberg and
                Røros, none along the long route between Christiania and Trondheim, which passes through the best
                provinces of the
                realm,


                <br> <a id="a50" href="" target="">50)</a> <br>

                where once, in not so ancient times, there was the significant town of Hammer. The highly praised skill
                of the Norwegian
                farmers in making various household goods proves their distance from cities. If they had more nearby,
                for a closer sale
                of their products and for the purchase of their needs, they would have more encouragement, more time for
                agriculture,
                and they would find it less worthwhile to make their own tools.
                The influence that each such country town would have over a wide area can be measured by that of the
                mentioned mountain
                towns, particularly the comparatively smaller Røros. The people living there on a wild mountain must
                have all their
                needs supplied. Because of this, many residents from the surrounding, some also distant provinces gather
                there, creating
                a trade that extends far beyond the actual needs of the inhabitants of Røros. For, since the residents
                from different
                provinces know they will meet each other at this gathering place,

                <br> <a id="a51" href="" target="">51)</a> <br>

                they rely on a trade among themselves, turning this gathering place into a kind of permanent market,
                bringing a lot of
                goods that do not stay there, thus ensuring that their overall journey, both going and returning, is
                profitable. For
                example, the entire parish of Selbu lives from freight: it includes a break of millstones that they take
                to Røros to
                leave them for the southern inhabitants, while taking copper back to Trondheim from Røros; all the grain
                they can grow
                is for their horses, and they buy their own provisions in the city or from their neighbors, thus these
                have their
                earnings from the Selbu residents. So, one person lives off another; the effort devoted to agriculture
                pays off when
                there is a certain market right at the door, and likewise, in Denmark, if more factories spread out in
                the countryside,
                they would find their footing in the country towns and benefit from the surplus of hands increasing in
                the farming
                class, thus expanding the influence of industry on agriculture.

                <a id="a53" href="" target="">52)</a> <br>

                The reminder regarding Norway that efforts to further incorporate this realm must begin not with
                agriculture, but with
                urban trade and industry, is all the less superfluous, as attempts have also shown the difficulty of
                introducing
                colonists from the outside. Indeed, there are countless desolate spots in this vast country that are
                capable of
                cultivation, but only under certain conditions that must first be in place.

                Reflections on the contributions of the government regarding the trades of the subjects! A vast field
                where one can
                easily and greatly lose one's way if one does not keep a guide based on certain simple principles in
                hand. Such
                principles are that people must engage each other in work through their needs; that a person contributes
                to total profit
                only insofar as they create something useful that would not exist without them;
                <br> <a id="a53" href="" target=""> 53)</a><br>

                that the government has what it has from the contributions of its subjects; thus, if it spends a part of
                this wealth on
                supporting a particular trade, nothing is gained in total as long as that trade relies on government
                contributions. The
                income of even the richest government, compared to the volume of trade conducted by the nation under its
                jurisdiction,
                is always a small sum, nor can it be otherwise; hence, the expenditure that it can justifiably make to
                support this or
                that particular branch of trade is insignificant compared to the contributions of the whole nation,
                which should partake
                in the favored trade. Therefore, the direct contribution of the government cannot go further than easing
                the difficult
                beginnings; however, a government can achieve much more by removing obstacles and has every reason to
                identify such
                obstacles, finding enough engagement in overseeing the trades of its subjects.


                <br> <a id="a54" href="" target=""> 54)</a><br>

                It may consider itself unusually fortunate if this useful task of removing obstacles is not demanded of
                it daily. The
                unseen total trade of a nation operates just like the visible part of it at a stock exchange or a fair;
                everything fits
                and intertwines with each other, and the greater the crowd, chaos, and noise, the better, as long as
                peace is
                maintained.

                there, but it is
                still a pleasure to see how diligently the inhabitants strive to cultivate the areas suitable for grass
                growth, as it is
                advantageous to keep draft animals, horses, and oxen due to the many transports required by the
                operation of the mine.

                investigating
                how founded this claim is, I will only say that it would be no surprise and would not merit any reproach
                if this were
                indeed the case. A state that, alongside agriculture, has fisheries and strong shipping has fewer hands
                available for
                factories than a landlocked state that bases its industry solely on the harvesting of land products,
                such as
                agriculture, vineyards, or even mining. This lack of labor for factories, along with the extremely
                burdensome smuggling,
                is a continuous hindrance to our factories, with our government having invested more in their

                Jutland and Funen, and the Tonder lace factories, which are all the more remarkable because they have
                established and
                maintained themselves without the support of the government. This proves that the nation lacks neither
                skill nor
                inclination for factories, nor opportunities within the state,

                <br> <a id="a57" href="" target=""> 57)</a><br>

                even with its still insufficient constitution for these purposes, to establish one or another factory
                suitable to
                specific circumstances, when knowledgeable factory owners can identify suitable locations and know how
                to approach the
                matter correctly.

                    Page 28. An Excess of Labor from the Peasant Class

                </h2>
                Our factories are still too concentrated in Copenhagen, and undoubtedly we all wish, as does our
                well-meaning
                government, which is diligently concerned with this important trade for the benefit of the state, that
                they may spread
                more into the provinces, especially those producing coarser goods, which must be operated with the
                greatest economy if
                prices are to be maintained and which cannot yield as much profit for the laborers employed there as is
                necessary for a
                worker's needs in a capital. The fact that they are still so clustered in Copenhagen, and that those
                initiated in the
                provinces do not progress well,

                <br> <a id="a58" href="" target=""> 58)</a><br>
                is partly due to the fact that our manufacturers, who still very much require ongoing support from the
                government,
                prefer to be close to it. Additionally, the necessary oversight under such circumstances makes them
                eager to keep them
                in view. However, this is not the only reason; in my opinion, the large garrison in Copenhagen is a
                mainstay for the
                local factories, and this support is lacking for the factories in the provincial towns. This becomes
                evident each time
                the garrison must be kept under arms for more than the usual period for military service.
                <br><br>
                Truly, the entire nation lacks hands in sufficient numbers for a substantial operation of the factories,
                and our
                commendable government is to be pitied for having to contend with this great insurmountable obstacle to
                its good
                intentions. Its efforts to provide the state with the great advantages of flourishing factories are
                always worthy of
                praise and thanks; much has indeed been accomplished. What can or cannot be done in a state


                <br> <a id="a59" href="" target="">59)</a> <br>
                cannot be known until work is commenced, allowing experience to later express itself, which must not be
                preempted by
                premature judgments. In general, factories are delicate plants that require immense patience and
                forbearance for their
                maintenance.<br><br>
                But as I said, and what I may be allowed to say, with the intention of not criticizing but rather
                providing well-meaning
                considerations, it seems to me that the right moment for factories in Denmark has not yet come, nor is
                it to be expected
                until the improved condition of the peasant class results in the often-mentioned surplus of labor.

                <br><br>

                Due to this connection between the peasant class and the factory system, I have deliberately engaged
                with the few
                considerations regarding the factory system as an essential part of my plan. I cannot emphasize enough
                that one should
                not be surprised if, here as elsewhere, the unfavorable condition of the peasant class stands in the
                way. I see this as
                a powerful favorable prejudice for my principles or system, as it is often referred to.



                <br> <a id="a60" href="" target="">60)</a> <br>
                This connection between the peasant class and urban trades is mentioned in the often-cited decree of
                Frederick IV from
                February 21, 1702, where, among other reasons for the abolition of the obligation to remain in one’s
                birthplace, this is
                also stated:<br><br>
                "To ensure that if inhabitants of the flatlands are blessed by God with several sons, who have neither
                the desire nor
                need for fieldwork and farming, some of them may learn trades, commerce, seafaring, and other skills in
                order to earn
                their living honorably and decently afterward."

                    Page 28. That the constitution of the peasantry may align with this great purpose.

                </h2>
                If we are allowed to speak the truth and are willing to admit it, the constitution of the national
                militia in Denmark
                has two great flaws: it is insufficient for the purpose of defense and is very unfavorable to the
                peasantry.
                Both of these issues become evident when compared with Norway and upon examining the numerous ordinances
                regarding the
                national militia in Denmark.<br><br>
                Norway, which still does not have as many inhabitants as Denmark, maintained, before the changes in
                military
                constitution occurred in both kingdoms, five national dragoon regiments and thirteen national infantry
                regiments, while
                Denmark had only four infantry regiments.


                <br><br>
                To achieve more than four times the number of troops in Norway, it was not deemed necessary to impose
                more than 9 years
                of service on the young farmer.


                <br> <a id="a62" href="" target=""> 62)</a><br>
                In Denmark, however, where only one-quarter of that number is provided, it was deemed necessary to bind
                the farmer from
                the age of 4 until the age of 40.<br><br>
                In Norway, since the ordinance of February 28, 1705, until 1763, no significant changes have been made
                to the
                constitution of the military establishment there. However, in Denmark, from the ordinance of February
                22, 1701, until
                April 13, 1764, there has been an extraordinary number of ordinances, both those explicitly concerning
                the military
                establishment and others related to it, with their various motives being quite remarkable.
                <br><br>

                After the ordinance of February 22, 1701, through which Frederick IV introduced a properly organized
                land militia in
                Denmark, the peasant was obligated to serve for 6 years. This new national militia, which rendered good
                service in all
                subsequent wars, consisted of 7 infantry and 3 or 4 dragoon regiments. At the time of the ordinance for
                Norway on
                February 28, 1705, there were only 6 infantry regiments and 3 dragoon regiments, with 9 years of
                service.



                <br> <a id="a63" href="" target="">63)</a> <br>

                In the oft-mentioned ordinance of February 21, 1702, one of the reasons cited for the abolition of
                serfdom was, “so that
                this freedom may give the peasants more spirit and courage to risk their lives for the fatherland, if
                necessary.”
                According to the ordinance of December 27, 1701, the common man, if deserving, could advance to the rank
                of
                non-commissioned officer after 6 years of service, and from there further to the rank of senior
                officer.<br><br>
                In the ordinance of February 19, 1707, it was decreed that only 20 men per company could be discharged
                annually, but
                those who were held beyond their 6 years of service in this manner were to enjoy a certain sum of money
                as compensation.
                <br><br>
                By the ordinance of October 30, 1730, the land militia was abolished "due to certain abuses and as an
                institution that
                had become a great and almost unbearable burden to the country in general, and to the young men in
                particular."

                <br> <a id="a64" href="" target="">64)<br>
                </a>By the ordinance of February 4, 1733, the land militia was re-established, especially for the reason
                that "the welfare
                of the country required that the freedom of the peasants, which they had gained through the abolition of
                the land
                militia, be somewhat restricted by its reintroduction."<br><br>
                The service years were 8 for men under 30 years old, and 6 years for those over 30. After completing
                their years of
                service, the man was to be discharged, completely free from the estate, and allowed to accept a farm on
                the estate of
                another landowner.
                <br><br>
                But in the ordinance of June 30, 1741, the annual discharge per company was limited to 12 men, and soon
                after to only 6
                men. The others, whose time had otherwise expired, were kept for longer; a soldier aged 18–24 was to
                serve for 12 years,
                one aged 24–31 for 10 years, and one aged 31–36 for 8 years. Moreover, the landowners were given the
                authority to hand
                over a man, who after completing his service did not want to take a farm, to the guard or a recruited
                infantry regiment.

                <br> <a id="a65" href="" target=""></a> 65)<br>
                Through the decree of October 12, 1742, the rights of the landowners over their young men were expanded
                to the point
                where they began from the 9th year, and the entire force, both active and reserve men, from ages 18 to
                40, had to remain
                on the roll.<br><br>
                In the decree of November 12, 1745, the 6 men discharged annually per company were allowed to enlist in
                a recruited
                regiment.<br><br>
                Seven months later, in the ordinance of July 1, 1746, this same decree was repealed, and it was decreed
                that a soldier,
                even after completing his service years, should not have the permission to settle elsewhere, except on
                the estate where
                he was registered, and was thus required to take a farm there.

                <br> <a id="a66" href="" target="">66)<br>

                    Finally, according to the ordinance of April 13, 1764, the landowner’s rights over his peasants were
                    to begin as early
                    as the conclusion of their fourth year of childhood, and they were to remain on the roll from this
                    fourth year until the
                    age of 40.<br><br>
                    In this way, the unfreedom and adscriptio glebae (serfdom, binding peasants to the land) of the
                    peasants subjected to
                    the estate owners, which, before the ordinance of February 21, 1702, was not common throughout
                    Denmark but only
                    practiced in the provinces of Zealand, Lolland, Falster, Møn, and the surrounding islands, and which
                    was abolished by
                    Frederick IV through the aforementioned ordinance in order to place these provinces on equal footing
                    with the other
                    provinces, this adscriptio glebae, I say, has not only been reintroduced through the establishment
                    of the national
                    militia but has been extended across all of Denmark, thus thwarting the freedom intended for the
                    peasantry by Frederick
                    IV. For anyone who is bound to their birthplace from the age of four until 40—well beyond the time
                    when a person should
                    establish themselves—cannot be called free, whether this restriction on freedom is tied to birth or
                    arises from other
                    causes.


                    <br> <a id="a67" href="" target="">67)<br>

                        Here, then, lies a stumbling block that must necessarily be removed if anything truly just is
                        ever to be done for the
                        improvement of the constitution of the peasantry.
