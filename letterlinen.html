                Illustrious Sir,<br><br>

                I send this letter to you ahead of all others, as a disciple and friend of Haller, the Doctor from
                Göttingen. Even
                if I were better known in the literary world than my years and abilities allow, scarcely would there be
                a more
                fitting argument to seek your favor.<br><br>

                I too am your disciple, Illustrious Sir, since those from whose writings we have benefited most are
                doctors of
                public esteem, such as yourself, whom we revere not merely for their proximity or ease of acquaintance,
                but for
                their public merits.<br><br>

                Fortified by the testimonials of illustrious men Haller and Walhof, I arrived in Copenhagen four months
                ago and have
                been fortunate. I am German (from Ansbach), seeking favor with our King. His Majesty has informed me
                that he
                approves of my proposal to devote my best efforts under his dominion. I am not yet in a definite
                position, nor am I
                a member of the University. Meanwhile, with the court's approval, I shall engage in botanical
                work.<br><br>

                There is hope that a Botanical Garden will be established in this city. For now, the path must be
                prepared to
                execute this purpose. It has pleased me to initiate this endeavor. I have been granted a plot in one of
                the royal
                gardens in this city, and I am promised the necessary resources.<br><br>

                I will be greatly assisted by the illustrious Haller in every way possible. Today, I write to present
                myself to you,
                Illustrious Sir. Thus, without doubt, he will commend me to you in his own words. I am confident that
                you will
                support our efforts, as you have rightly praised the merits of others in describing their gardens in
                Uppsala. I hope
                that my studies will not disappoint your benevolence towards me.<br><br>

                Therefore, I implore you repeatedly to assist me, Illustrious Sir. With your permission, I will specify
                the
                resources needed. Meanwhile, judging by the start, I find no shortage of work and, with the utmost
                judgment, what
                could be suitable for the soil of Copenhagen. Having reviewed the catalog of the Göttingen garden, I
                understand what
                I can expect and what I cannot. Please send me seeds of plants that will be ready as soon as
                possible.<br><br>

                Expenses incurred will be met as soon as they are indicated. Mutual obligations will be fulfilled
                promptly, whenever
                the opportunity arises.<br><br>

                In the course of time and our literary exchange, if I may hope for this honor and joy, we will examine
                how not only
                seeds but also entire plants can be transported to Copenhagen.<br><br>

                If I am admitted late to this business, which I will accept, I foresee that, after many years have
                passed, the
                beginning will be difficult, as all beginnings are, and therefore the progress may be slower. But even
                so, I hope my
                efforts will achieve some success, which surely will not escape the fair judgment of your eyes.<br><br>

                I hope for a timely response to this letter, and a favorable response indeed, if I prove myself to you
                as an admirer
                and cultivator of arts akin to your own art and that of similar esteemed men.<br><br>

                Illustrious Sir,<br><br>

                With the utmost respect and deference,<br><br>

                Most ready to prove myself,<br><br>

                Georgius Christianus Oeder<br><br>

                Copenhagen, April 8, 1752<br><br>

                I add the address for the letter to be delivered to me:<br><br>

                To Oeder, Doctor of Medicine and Corresponding Member<br>

                of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Göttingen,<br>

                Knight of the Order of the Polar Star,<br><br>

                Physician to the Royal Majesty of Sweden,<br><br>

                </aside>

                Dear Mr. Linnaeus,<br><br>

                I hereby send you a program for the work "Flora Danica," which our court envoy will deliver to you along
                with this
                letter, by order of the king. I also promise you a copy of the work itself with the colored
                illustrations, a gift
                from our generous king, who supports not only useful arts and sciences but also the most distinguished
                scholars.
                Therefore, Mr. Linnaeus, I firmly hope that you will not only be a kind advocate of this work among your
                colleagues
                but also a promoter and supporter of our botanical institute as a whole, especially our garden. I have
                seen no
                better opportunity than this to ask for your support and friendship, which I have respectfully sought
                many times
                before. Therefore, I ask you to regard me as your student and rest assured that I will be grateful and
                extremely
                willing to reciprocate this favor, should you wish to contribute some of the seeds and roots you may
                have to spare
                for our newly established garden. Our garden is taking its first steps under the best conditions and the
                close
                personal supervision of our king, and no expense is spared. After spending a long time in Norway and now
                finally
                back in Copenhagen in a free study without restrictions and with clear guidelines for everything to be
                done in terms
                of building, filling, and decorating the garden, I can now devote myself fully to this task. Our
                country's trade
                extends through many parts of the world, including colonies outside of Europe, and there are still many
                opportunities for us to acquire plants that we can make more and more use of. Therefore, I hope that
                even though our
                garden is now only in its early stages and cannot avoid being poor, it will soon flourish, allowing us
                to delight
                our foreign friends by sharing the garden with them and providing mutual services. If our Arabian
                travelers, whom we
                recently heard arrived in Marseille, send seeds from the places they visit to me, I promise you, Mr.
                Linnaeus, an
                equal share of everything. And I ask you not to believe that I am trying to compete with the excellent
                Forskål, whom
                I greatly respect, but he was too attached to his own plans and did not really know how to gracefully
                withdraw, as
                the courtiers say. So, Mr. Linnaeus, do not believe that we harbor any ill will toward our friendly
                neighboring
                nation, even though there would have been no discussion at all about Mr. Forskål.<br><br>

                Additionally, as you see, I have arranged an index of your botanical pinacicle to facilitate the trade
                of plants
                with friends. It can easily be sent around the world with public couriers along with this letter. Under
                each number
                or letter representing each species, I provide notes on the species available to me, so you can see what
                I lack and
                what I can request. From the copy I have prepared for my own use and keep with me, copies can easily be
                made by an
                assistant whenever needed. Another great advantage of this index is that I use it in place of your
                catalog and have
                generic-trivial names written on wax tablets, oiled and hung on poles near the plants in our garden. I
                ask for your
                friendship and acceptance of its use, should you decide to grant it, and when I understand it, I will
                send another
                copy of the index with the noted species available to me. I will also handle everything related to the
                seeds and
                roots you kindly provide, and if you wish to instruct your gardeners to find them, I will ensure their
                efforts are
                rewarded. Farewell!<br><br>

                With the most respectful and esteemed regards from Mr. Ascanius.<br>

                To the renowned Linnaeus,<br><br>

                Knight of the Order of the Polar Star,<br><br>

                Physician to the Royal Majesty,<br><br>

                and the most distinguished botanist,<br><br>

                Georg Christian Oeder sends his warmest regards.<br><br>

                Dear Mr. Linnaeus,<br><br>

                Your much appreciated letters, written on August 16th, finally reached me yesterday, which surprises me,
                and I
                emphasize that if you wish to respond to them and send them to Mr. Forskål, this should be done promptly
                to avoid
                delay. If it pleases you, I will ensure that my two letters on the same subject are sent to our envoy to
                the Ottoman
                Empire and to London, so they can be dispatched by the ships that depart annually from England to fetch
                Mocha in
                Arabia. These attempts can be executed, but I dare not guarantee that these letters will reach Forskål.
                Since our
                missionaries departed Constantinople for Marseille, we have heard nothing from our Arabian missionaries.
                Their plan
                was to stay in Byzantium for about two months and consider the best way to continue their
                journey.<br><br>

                In the past year, someone in England published a treatise on preserving seeds from various regions using
                wax. Would
                not your advice, Mr. Linnaeus, primarily go against the use of salt as a refrigerant?<br><br>

                Soon, I will send a copy of the first volume of my icons to my colleague, Mr. Kruger, who resides in
                Helsingør, and
                I ask him to promptly send it to you. It will include both a black-and-white copy of my book, belonging
                to my flora,
                and a part of the painted or illuminated copy, as I previously mentioned that I would gift to you. I
                will quickly
                finish the rest of these tables from your copy and send them to you as soon as possible. In the
                meantime, you can
                evaluate clean tables from the second full copy of my work and use this first volume to design your new
                edition of
                species, of which I ask you to transfer a copy to our man, Mr. Mangor, who is currently with you.
                Besides the title,
                nomenclature, and birthplaces are enclosed with this volume.<br><br>

                Regarding Mr. Forskål, whom I find worthy and corresponding to my dealings, I will further explain what
                I wrote in
                my previous letter. While considering finding a co-worker, he should have consulted our court
                administrator, who
                could not approve his choice of Mr. Falk, who had not been mentioned earlier. But since Mr. Forskål
                arrived late,
                after our young researchers discussed a suitable candidate, and he brought Mr. Falk without prior
                notice, he made
                our officials suspicious due to his excessive self-confidence. It was not surprising that this was not
                well
                received. However, I gladly accept that he values my friendship, as you confirm in your letters and Mr.
                Spengler,
                and I am pleased to know that he also acknowledges my sincerity, as Mr. Forskål attests. Above all, I
                value truth
                and strive to defend it, but without undermining my respect for my friends or great teachers in the
                field, and
                certainly not to be envious.<br><br>

                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img5" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">

                </aside>
                Therefore, Mr. Linnaeus, I ask you not to give credence to the suspicions of discord that have arisen
                due to rumors
                you mention spreading there. It seems you have no reason to doubt it. I have repeatedly assured Mr.
                Forskål that I
                will share the dried plants and seeds he sends me. Recently, when he wrote from Marseille, he requested
                permission
                to send his collections when opportunities arise and ships from any nation are available to our
                travelers, either to
                France to Sauvages or to England or Holland without delay. You can write directly to him at your
                convenience, and
                you will receive what I receive safely and intact.<br><br>

                If you still have the kind intention to accept my seeds for my newly established garden, I will gladly
                supply you
                with the seeds you hope for. I am not only willing to make these available to you, although our garden
                is currently
                in its infancy and we may not be able to provide you with anything in return in the first years, I am
                ready to pay
                for the gifts you give me, if desired.<br><br>

                Summer is still intense here with us, and autumn still seems far away. When the plant counts for my
                current
                collection are completed, I will send you a brochure as previously mentioned with accompanying
                figures.<br><br>

                Before winter, I expect, on Mr. Miller's request, good supplies of seeds and bulbs from Chelsea Garden,
                both from
                France, Holland, and Germany, and also from Mr. Haller, who recently wrote to me about his new edition
                of his
                catalog and has sent appropriate young men to the Alps, especially the Rhaetian Alps, to look for new
                species at my
                own expense. He is now the inspector of the saltworks in Bern and resides in a valley in the
                Alps.<br><br>

                Soon, I also expect Mr. Gorter's English flora, which he has left to a friend of mine in Norway, when he
                arrives
                with a ship to search for his homeland with his whole family, abandoned in St. Petersburg and all his
                fortune.<br><br>

                Farewell, and I appreciate your kind attention.<br><br>

                To the esteemed gentleman,<br><br>

                Carl von Linné,<br><br>

                Knight of the Order of the North Star, Royal Physician, etc.<br><br>

                Georg Christian Oeder sends his warmest regards.<br><br>

                Having inspected the first volume of your new edition of the book "Species Plantarum," which has only
                recently
                reached my hands, I am compelled once again to request, as I did in my last letter, that you refrain
                from referring
                to the illustrations in "Flora Danica" other than by simply mentioning the plate numbers and omitting
                the
                names.<br><br>

                <aside class="asideleft"><img id="img9" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio9" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                I have explained in the preface to the publication the reasons why we publish the illustrations of
                plants separately
                from the descriptions or text, as it is commonly called. It is clear to anyone examining the specimens
                enclosed in
                the first volume of illustrations that the sole purpose was to provide at least the synonyms from the
                most prominent
                authors who have aided in identifying each plant either by description and selection of characteristics
                or by
                illustrations, so that buyers do not receive entirely unknown plants while the text was prepared. I
                provide these
                synonyms, of which none is publicly declared or desired to be sanctioned under my name, as this
                certainly is not my
                task in this place, if it ever will be. I arrange these synonyms in chronological order, starting with
                the
                discoverer and ending with the latest entry in your "Pinax," excluding intermediaries who have not
                contributed
                significantly to the plant's history, except for Caspar Bauhin, the collector of synonyms up to his
                time. I cannot
                convince myself that it makes any difference whether you follow a direct or reverse chronological order
                or conclude
                anything about my attitude toward the authors I cite, as if those I mention first are of greater
                importance to me,
                or that I hold you, as the leading figure in the field, in lower esteem because I cite your latest work
                last.<br><br>

                Given this, I had hoped and indeed expected that you would cite this first volume by merely mentioning
                the plate
                numbers, and since I have included your names everywhere, including the trivial ones, after mentioning
                your own
                books, you would add my Flora, as has been done by Cornus suecica.<br><br>
                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img10" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio10" data=""></object>
                </aside>

                But you chose, dear Sir, generally to cite the name I have adopted as the first synonym for each plate,
                which,
                although very different from my opinion, could have been tolerated if you had simultaneously mentioned
                the authors'
                books from which these synonyms are derived. But now, when readers of your book see, for example, under
                Saxifraga
                Stelleri (and the same applies to many other places where my references occur), the final line: Sedum
                alpinum 13
                Oed. Dan. t. 23, what are these readers to think of me, as long as they have not seen my book and do not
                know me,
                and what are they to think of you, which I say with all respect, when they have access to my book? In
                the first
                case, they would think I was a foolish person unless a forbearing person, who finds it unlikely that
                such a person
                could be assigned to perform a work under a royal name, or anyone accustomed to reading Clusius' works,
                will suspect
                a typographical error. In the second case, they will marvel at the strange citation and the meaning
                attributed to my
                words and my intent. Frankly, dear Sir, if you calmly consider the whole matter, you will find it so
                constructed
                that one who wishes to undermine me and my work subtly could do so almost in this way.<br><br>

                But I am convinced that your heart's openness is not surpassed by your profound knowledge, and that far
                from having
                such intentions, you would rather regret that an occasion has been given for such suspicion.<br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"><img id="img11" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">

                </aside>

                You hardly know me yet, dear Sir, except for what Forskålius, as you have written yourself, has reported
                about me to
                you, and although I have not made myself notable, I remember nothing in myself that would bring shame
                upon me and
                the task I have been entrusted with, in which everything must be arranged from the beginning and remain
                at an early
                stage.<br>

                Therefore, appreciating you and your friendship, if I should deserve it, I do not wish to seek any
                person's, however
                famous they may be, goodwill in any other way than that which suits us both.<br><br>

                Thus, convinced of your openness and fairness, dear Sir, I hope that you will be willing to prevent the
                harm that my
                citations in your work, albeit involuntary on your part, may cause me, and that you will rectify the
                harm
                done.<br><br>

                As soon as a suitable opportunity presents itself, I will send you a complete copy of the first fascicle
                colored by
                our best workers, and I ask you to return the half that is now in your hands to the distinguished young
                Fabrizius,
                who will deliver this letter to you. The second fascicle is in press. However, until the complete one is
                published,
                I will send you, if you wish, the separate plates that have been printed, namely the uncolored
                ones.<br><br>

                Forskålius' latest letters from Cairo were dated June of this year and sent via Livorno, from where I
                expect seeds
                and manuscripts he mentions daily, if the diligence of the merchants does not fail. Included in these
                letters was a
                sample specimen of a plant he intended to name after me, but this plant is certainly a species of Cleome
                and indeed
                a violet one. If you wish, I will send it to you.<br><br>

                Farewell, and be assured that I am among those who consider it a great honor to have won the most
                prominent figures
                in the art.<br><br>

                    I have
                    decided to respond briefly and clearly, so I enclose my comments on selected parts of your
                    letter.<br><br>

                    I will not add more than a reminder of the honor with which I honor you, esteemed sir, because of
                    your great
                    merits in botany, although it may not be fitting for me to do so publicly. Farewell!<br><br>

                Excerpt from your letter<br><br>

                "As you are angry, as I can see, you may not accept the reasons that, if you did accept them, would
                cause you not to
                be angry with me, but rather with yourself. If I may speak as a friend, my conclusion would be as
                follows.<br><br>

                Upon your instigation, the most generous King of Denmark sent you:<br><br>

                to his domains to examine the native plants.<br><br>
                An excellent artist beautifully illustrated the plants. You added synonyms in chronological order, since
                none of
                them pleased you. I do not understand, and perhaps no one else does, how you can publish a royal work
                without
                descriptions on the spot and especially without names given to the plants, which I have never seen done
                by anyone
                except Merian in her Surinamese work, but she was a woman.<br><br>

                I could not cite your Flora without names. There were no names, only synonyms. Therefore, I had to cite
                the first
                name in each paragraph to refer to the plate where the plant was illustrated, not to give a name, as you
                had no
                actual name.<br><br>

                Who has ever cited the last synonym from an author? If I had done so, what would you and others have
                thought of me
                and my learning?<br><br>

                But you insist that I should have named the author from whom you took your first name. Many times I have
                cited
                Vaillant, Barrelier, etc., where they used Tournefort's name (without mentioning Tournefort), when I
                wished to refer
                the reader to a beautiful observation or illustration. I did not cite the older authors because of their
                erroneous
                names but for their illustrations; if I had cited an old author, the reader would have thought that I
                was referring
                to the observation and would have felt misled.<br><br>

                Caspar Bauhin also proposed synonyms in chronological order, but he always placed his own name before
                them. If you
                had done the same, you would not have been angry with me or others. You accuse yourself of an error, not
                other good
                people. If you want my advice, then, when you publish the next installment, issue a catalog of your
                names so that
                readers know which name to use. This requires artistry from you. This is appropriate for one who
                publishes such a
                magnificent and truly royal work; also add, if you wish, your descriptions, so that malicious people do
                not
                misinterpret your actions and say that the artist did an excellent piece of work while you did
                nothing."<br><br>

                </aside>

                My comments<br><br>

                Let me only defend myself, and without any jealousy in my words, let me say what you may not know, that
                the entire
                botanical project in Copenhagen was started and continues according to my instructions. I selected the
                artist whom
                you praise, and under my guidance, he paints. Please do not look down on this man, whom other serious
                men know
                better than you do.<br><br>

                Synonyms neither please nor displease. They are taken where found and cited not for the sake of the name
                (which does
                not contribute to the understanding of the plant and only brings to mind a well-known idea) but to
                clarify the place
                in the book that is cited.<br><br>

                Why not? Can one not publish a collection of illustrations without descriptions, just as one can publish
                descriptions without illustrations, like geographical maps without geography and geography without
                maps?<br><br>

                Descriptions are promised and will be published within a few years, which I hope you live long enough to
                see. The
                reasons why the descriptions are separated from the illustrations are explained in my program, which you
                should read
                before criticizing.<br><br>

                The illustrations are now published in lieu of the herbarium, and Merian, while she only presented the
                forms, did it
                right, though she was a woman. If she had added names, what could they have contributed to the
                understanding of the
                plant outside of the system? However, we add synonyms so that buyers of this herbarium, which we
                temporarily offer
                them, can compare it with botanical writings.<br><br>

                Could you not? If you had always cited my Flora as under Veronica 13 and Cornus 4, or as you cite
                Miller's, Du
                Hamel's, and Plumier's illustrations in Systema Naturae.<br><br>

                You should have cited the number engraved on the plate, which is placed in front of each
                paragraph.<br><br>

                When authors are cited, synonyms collected by them are not cited, but their own or those declared by
                them, no matter
                where they wanted to pass on or declare such names.<br><br>

                Absolutely not. If at the end of your names you had indicated that the plant, which you had determined,
                was
                illustrated with a number in Flora Danica, who could then have accused you of vanity?<br><br>

                Rightly so, as you could not fail to notice that by mentioning me but omitting the books from which the
                names come,
                which you cite as mine, these names are made ridiculous, and it is your own fault.<br><br>

                Vaillant and Barrelier &c. from Tournefort's school confessed to Tournefort's nomenclature. I have not
                confessed
                anything similar.<br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"><img id="img16" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio16" data=""></object>
                </aside>

                I also do not cite these older authors for the sake of names but for the honor due to discoverers and
                the first
                descriptions, especially the outstanding Clusius. Therefore, you should not have attributed these names
                to me
                without mentioning the authors at the same time.<br><br>

                Bauhin's purpose was to write a concordance of names, whereas my purpose was to guide buyers of the most
                important
                books, which they could compare with this herbarium.<br><br>

                If my prayers can achieve anything with you, I earnestly beg you to only cite our illustrations by
                mentioning the
                numbers engraved on the plates.<br><br>

                How do you demonstrate this? Is it necessary for every new author to increase the number of names, which
                botany
                already suffers too much from? Should it not be allowed for me through you to honor you and other
                masters in the art
                without constantly choosing a name and swearing by it? Is plant recognition based on the name or rather
                on the
                characteristics that distinguish each species from all others in the plant world? If someone wishes to
                organize
                characteristics invented, selected, and defined by himself or others for all known plants or for a
                specific number
                of plants, e.g., the wild plants in a region, in a fair order where readers are led to the
                characteristic that fits
                a given plant, and under each characteristic, separated from the neighbors, cite authors who have
                written about such
                a plant by either indicating the page and place in the book or adding the name that anyone has given to
                the plant;
                if he himself does not add a new name or declare one of the synonyms as his own, would you then blame
                such a man for
                his lack of art and today's learning, and call him ignorant of the world of literature and
                books?<br><br>

                These are truly malicious and ignorant of my promise in the program, or if they know the project's
                purpose, they are
                unfair and arrogant in despising what has not yet been published. It is not my intention to count you
                among such
                people, but you could have appropriately refrained from mentioning such a suspicion, which harms me no
                less than my
                superiors.<br><br>

                <h2>
                    April 18th 1764
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High and Honorable<br>

                    Highly esteemed Sir Archiater<br>

                    For Your Honor, I must explain the context with the enclosed letter from Mr. Miller.<br>

                    My friend, Mr. Justice Councilor Hübner, who during his stay in London for several years now has
                    facilitated my
                    correspondence with Mr. Miller, wrote to me on March 21 last, stating that with a young Danish
                    gardener who at
                    that time had sailed from London to Helsingør, I would receive a package with a large supply of
                    seeds from Mr.
                    Miller. Last Saturday, 8 days after the letter arrived, the person with the package appeared, whom I
                    opened it
                    in his presence and searched for a letter, as nothing was attached except on top; therefore cut the
                    envelopes,
                    an outer and inner one, because under the outer one was a letter to me, and under the inner one the
                    seed
                    capsules, 168 in number. Upon reading my letter, I found these words: "I have also sent a small
                    parcel for Dr.
                    Linnaeus, which I beg you will be so good as to forward as soon as you possibly can," and asked the
                    person, by
                    letting him read the words himself, where this second package was. He replied that he had only what
                    was before
                    our eyes, but that Mr. Hübner, when he took leave of him, had spoken about something which he would
                    send him
                    during his stay, but that he immediately had to go on board, so that if something had come to the
                    gardener's
                    quarter, it was too late.<br><br>

                    Now I could therefore by comparing the gardener's report with what Mr. Hübner had written and what
                    Mr. Miller
                    himself writes about a small parcel, not think otherwise, than that the package for Your Honor was
                    forgotten in
                    London, and so I gave myself to insert the labels of the capsules in my catalog for the current year
                    and to
                    number them.<br><br>

                    But the day after, when the envelopes from which the capsules had been taken had to be removed, on
                    the inner and
                    consequently hidden side of the inner envelope was found a letter to Your Honor, attached to the
                    envelope.<br><br>

                    In this dilemma and in the hope of finding information in the letter, I proposed to my colleague,
                    whom I know
                    Your Honor trusts, if he would undertake to open the letter, and since there is also mention of "a
                    few seeds" in
                    it, just as in the one to me about "a small parcel," it is still undecided whether Mr. Miller
                    understood the
                    package that came to me, containing 168 capsules, thus not insignificant, and not "a few seeds," or
                    if he means
                    another package that must have been forgotten.<br><br>

                    To get out of the matter in a fair way, I have taken some grains out of the capsules of the
                    varieties that I
                    lack, and packed them back together, and today I shall deliver the package to the Swedish Chargé
                    d'affaires with
                    the request that he will see it forwarded soon. I think that even if it should turn out that this
                    package has
                    been intended for Your Honor from the very beginning, My Lord will not regret that I have taken some
                    grains out
                    of the capsules, nor my handling of the matter. If anything comes up to me that may fail with you,
                    it is gladly
                    at your service.<br><br>

                    After half a year's old news from Livorno and quite new ones from Amsterdam, we can expect the
                    arrival of some
                    seeds from our missionaries in Arabia very soon. If that package arrives in Your Honor's hands, it
                    shall be
                    promptly forwarded by me. From the previous seeds of Mr. Forskål, some beautiful herbs have emerged
                    with us, and
                    their remains shall be cultivated and nurtured by myself this year, as I will be present in
                    Copenhagen in the
                    summer, but there will certainly be some of Mr. Forskål's new genera to be included, e.g., Oederia
                    n. is Cleome;
                    Thaumasta is Hypecoum, Gramen singulare is Crucianella. I have orders to have the new and
                    particularly rare ones
                    that emerge from Mr. Forskål's seeds drawn. As soon as some copies of the third installment of Flora
                    Danica of
                    the finest kind are finished, Your Honor shall receive yours.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    {div-signature}<br>
                    With great consideration,<br>

                    Your High and Honorable<br>

                <h2>
                    April 13th 1768
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the record <br>

                    Since I now have no friend in Stockholm ready to handle my small errands as Mr. Konstrup did before,
                    I will in
                    the future entrust this copy of Flora Danica, painted in colors, to Mr. Faxel, secretary of the
                    Swedish legation
                    at our court, whom I shall send to the venerable Mr. Linnaeus as a royal gift, starting with the
                    sixth volume,
                    which has not yet reached Mr. Linnaeus due to Konstrup's departure. However, I ask the venerable Mr.
                    Linnaeus to
                    send a receipt for the receipt of the gift to the aforementioned Mr. Faxel, who will deliver it to
                    me when he
                    receives the book. <br> <br>

                    The second volume of the latest edition of Systema Naturae, which has only recently reached us, has
                    prompted me
                    to make the following minor remarks, which I hope the author of the system will not take too
                    heavily. <br> <br>

                <aside class="asideleft"><a id="img19href" href=""><img id="img19" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio19" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                Peplis portula is equipped with petals when it grows lushly, but usually lacks them when the plants grow
                in dry
                places and are smaller and more stunted. <br> <br>

                Saxifraga caespitosa is attributed yellow petals in Systema Naturae, but in our volume 71 the petals are
                white, only
                slightly yellowish and greenish. <br> <br>

                Regarding Saxifraga aizoides, volume 72 is referenced. However, in our specimens, the leaves always have
                prickly
                edges, which is the only difference from the autumnal aizoides, if they differ at all. The color of the
                petals often
                varies from lighter to darker, and the sepals are either green or faintly reddened on the same plant.
                Ström and
                Gunnerus have identified the Norwegian as the autumnal aizoides with me. <br> <br>

                Juncus triglumis is referenced in volume 120. Certainly, volume 130, which we call triglumis,
                corresponds to the
                flora in Lapland volume 10, figure 5. This figure of Linnaeus' Juncus triglumis is very different from
                our volume
                120 and from the figure of Juncus biglumis in Amoenitates Academicae. The leaves in my description,
                which I wrote
                down, were present when the figure in volume 120 was painted from a live plant; I now see, upon
                rereading, that they
                were slightly twisted and subulate. <br> <br>
                <br>
                Regarding Scirpus caespitosus, volume 167 is referenced. It is not Scirpus acicularis, as later volume
                287 shows. In
                the naming of this volume, I noted that it is caespitosus, which I am still not convinced of, as the
                stems are
                neither striped in the figure nor in the description, which I now reread carefully prepared at the same
                time as the
                plant was shown to the artist. The remarkable glumes that make the axis called bilobate are not observed
                in my
                plants, nor is the leafy ligule that comes from the mouth of the leaf sheath and surrounds the base of
                the stem,
                which is normally or always present in Scirpus caespitosus. <br> <br>

                I see that Stratiotes is left among the hermaphrodites, which certainly is dioecious, if any plant is
                dioecious.
                Besides the difference in the sexual organs, there is also a big difference in that the female flowers
                are always
                solitary in their sheath, at the top of the oblique triangular thick axis, while the male flowers are
                many in a
                common sheath, each separated with its own bract on its own long, round, soft stalks. However, the
                female flowers
                appear to be hermaphroditic due to the stack-like structures that resemble stamens, placed around the
                style.
                However, it is clear to the attentive observer that these rods are not true stamens, as in the male
                flower they
                surround the true stamens with polleniferous anthers. Since the male plants are much rarer than the
                female ones and
                do not grow in our Zealand except in ponds that are not always and everywhere available, this seems to
                be the reason
                why males have not yet been observed in Denmark. However, I will investigate this further at the given
                opportunity.
                In Holstein and Oldenburg, where the plant is more widespread and more easily accessible in ditches, I
                have often
                observed male flowers. Although they are few and sometimes far from the female flowers, the female
                flowers hardly
                seem to be able to do without them, as reproduction also occurs through the roots, as we see with other
                dioecious
                plants, where the separation of male and female plants is prevented by distances. <br> <br>

                Rubi chamaemori flowers seem to lack one sex in volume 1 of Flora Danica. <br> <br>

                The icon of Chara hispida in volume 154 shows the character of Chara, which rightly is transferred from
                algae to
                Phanerogams. <br>

                I would like to know where the venerable Archiater places Stellaria in volume 92 of Flora Danica and
                Draba in volume
                143, as well as Poa maritima Hudsoni in volume 251, a plant that is widespread worldwide and known among
                economists
                in Oldenburg, and therefore should also have its rightful place among botanists, and Subularia Dilleni
                in Muscorum
                volume 81, which, if my assumption is correct, is just a variation of Plantago uniflora covered with
                polyps and
                should be removed from botanical indexes, although it is accepted as a separate genus by Adanson. <br>
                <br>

                I would have liked Koenigia to be named Bergeria, as intended by its discoverer, in honor of the
                venerable Archiater
                Berger, his patron, and the first royal commissioner of the botanical institute in Copenhagen, just as
                Tournefort
                called Fagonia after the royal physician and superintendent of the garden in Paris. I had already shown
                a figure of
                the plant that Koenig brought from Iceland in Flora Danica volume 6, except for the hope of seeing the
                living plant
                grow from the seeds brought with it. <br> <br>

                Georg Christian Oeder sends his warmest regards.<br>

                In my response to your two letters, the first dated October 4, 1769, and the second recently received,
                dated January
                26 of last year, I hope for your forgiveness for the delay my reply to the first letter has suffered.
                Many worries
                and tasks distant from the world of botany have kept me occupied throughout the past year and the first
                part of this
                year. I have awaited events closely concerning me and my fate, as well as the outcome of concerns about
                our garden,
                which have not lightened but rather grown heavier during this time.<br><br>

                Having heard from our friend Zoege and from Murray in Göttingen that you, esteemed sir, have thought to
                honor my
                name by giving a new genus of plants my name, and that you wished for me to choose a plant which I liked
                best, I
                decided upon a lily, which I have described in the enclosed note, and I awaited an illustration of it
                from an
                artist. The reasons for this choice, if I may venture to suggest one, are that I desire a plant that is
                pleasant to
                behold and can be cultivated here without great difficulty, and therefore I have proposed this one.
                Since this
                naming is an honor in the botanical world, it is pleasing to have such memorials associated with our
                name. It now
                rests with you to choose between the proposed one and the bulbous lily, which I had thought to
                suggest.<br><br>

                I regret to inform you that good news cannot reach König this year, as one of our Indian ships, which
                was to reach
                the Tranquebar coast on its way to China, was detained and damaged by ice and therefore could not leave
                port and now
                must sail directly to China. I am all the more sorry as I know he eagerly awaits good news. He now
                receives double
                salary, both as physician to the religious mission and as royal natural historian, a title which the
                king has added
                with a pension of 180 imperials for life, whereas previously he was promised only for four years. I
                believe both
                these salaries together amount to about 500 thalers of our silver.<br><br>

                At a later date, I will send you an illustration of your Sibthorpia peregrina, which is cultivated from
                seeds sent
                by König from Madeira and is thriving well. He will send you more seeds along with some other rare
                plants that we
                receive and grow here.<br><br>

                Enclosed, I present an illustration of a fungus that I found in the autumn and am unsure how to
                classify. Its
                structure is very unique. I found only this single specimen.<br><br>

                The ninth installment of "Flora Danica" will soon be published, along with the first part of
                "Enumerationis
                plantarum Florae Danicae," which includes cryptantherae. I will send both books to you at the first
                opportunity,
                along with a political treatise on the conditions of peasants that I published last year anonymously, in
                German, and
                which has recently been translated into Danish.<br><br>

                </aside>

                This was written on February 21.<br>

                Now that the letter is to be concluded and sent by post tomorrow, February 25, the artist regrets that
                he has not
                yet completed the illustration of the promised lily. However, I do not wish to delay the letter and its
                attachments
                any longer, which include a sheet with my description of the bulbous plant, König's plant, which you
                called Oedera
                speciosa, Forskål's plant, which he called Justicia paniculata, a sample specimen of Forskål's plant,
                and some seeds
                of the bulbous plant.<br><br>

                Regarding the publication of Forskål's posthumous works, I cannot yet say anything definite until Mr.
                Niebuhr has
                completed his travel account, and the format and appearance of the books are determined. While Mr.
                Niebuhr works on
                his work, we will, as much as time and other obligations allow, organize Forskål's manuscripts. Our
                friend Zoege is
                nearly finished comparing dried herbs with our own. Since the deceased's handwriting is clear and
                written in
                oracles, I have made sure to have them copied on stitched paper blocks. These posthumous works will
                reveal many
                merits of this outstanding and diligent man, and I will do my best to honor his memory.<br><br>

                Farewell, esteemed sir, and please continue to favor me, who honors you in relation to your great
                merits!<br>

                Hafnia, February 24, 1770.<br>

                You will soon receive illustrations of the bulbous plant and the fungus.<br>
