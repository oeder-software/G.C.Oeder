                I. It is not only advisable, I said above (page 355), but necessary—and also not difficult—to make the
                calculations occurring in a relief institution comprehensible to any intelligent reader. When stripped
                of all algebra, the theories take on a very simple appearance; and now I intend to attempt such a
                comprehensible presentation of the true theory of widow funds.

                II. Certainly, it is necessary—in a matter so intimately tied to the public good, which concerns the
                welfare of wives and their husbands, of children and their fathers, and of entire families by the
                hundreds and thousands, and where a mistaken path followed for long can lead to the loss of barrels of
                gold, even millions—certainly, it is necessary that at least the directors of such institutions may see
                with their own enlightened eyes and act out of deep conviction. To doubt the will and desire for
                conviction would be contrary to the fairness and respect owed to esteemed and well-meaning men; and I
                therefore believe that the only thing lacking has been the proper degree of comprehensibility to produce
                widespread conviction and consensus about the true theory—which, in essence, can only be one. This would
                put an end to the many disputes that have often escalated into quarrels, prevent erroneous plans at
                their origin, and halt the progress of misguided measures.

                III. The actual foundation for everything is a mortality or decrement table—that is, a table from which
                one can see the degree to which a certain number of people born at the same time gradually disappear
                from the world. And among the various tables of this kind, we naturally choose, here in northern
                Germany, the one by Süßmilch, as it appears in the new edition, volume 2, pages 319–322.

                IV. Upon this foundation we build using certain teachings and aids from arithmetic. Namely:Firstly and
                most importantly, we need a table showing the growth of a capital sum when interest is
                compounded—interest upon interest—and continually added back to the principal.Secondly, for explanation,
                we need a table showing the present value of an upcoming periodic payment.Thirdly, for convenience and
                to ease the calculations, we make use of logarithmic tables.

            <section id="chap5">
                V. When what is strictly mathematical in the matter is either presupposed or set aside, and separated
                from the reasoning about the decrement table and the instruction on how to draw the proper conclusions
                and inductions from it—when all this is illustrated immediately by a single example, especially in a
                matter where each individual case can serve as instruction for all—then everything becomes
                comprehensible even without special mathematical knowledge. One finds that once the reasoning has been
                clarified, the calculation itself is easier to grasp than it might seem to someone unaccustomed to
                algebraic formulas. And while it may be lengthy and laborious, it consists entirely of purely mechanical
                operations.
                <br>
                <br>So first, a few words about the arithmetic tools that must be presupposed.

                VI. As for the use of logarithmic tables, the great ease they provide becomes immediately evident, since
                they transform multiplication into addition and division into subtraction. In the calculations required
                for establishing a relief institution, one deals with numbers of 4 to 6 digits, which must be multiplied
                or divided by one another.
                <br>
                <br>Moreover, logarithms are indispensable for constructing the two types of discount tables that will
                be explained shortly.

            </section>

            <section id="chap7">
                <br>VII. The following first auxiliary table is used to discount a distant single sum. This table,
                calculated at an interest rate of 2 percent, compounded semiannually, shows the growth of the capital
                through the addition of interest. If one multiplies any given capital by a number from this table, one
                finds the growth of the assumed capital over the period shown beside it in the table. Conversely, if one
                divides the given capital by the same number, one obtains its present value—provided it is a capital sum
                that becomes due only after the indicated time.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, the capital of 12,340 grows over 25 half-year terms (i.e., 12½ years) to 20,245, and to
                receive this amount of 12,340 in 12½ years is currently equivalent to a value of 7,521.6.

                <br>yields 4.3063202 log. of 20245. remains 3.8763102 log. of 7521.6.

                serves to discount a forthcoming periodic payment (i.e., a recurring and uniform annuity paid at set

                <br>Thus, a payment of 125, received semiannually 25 times, has a present value of 2440.5 — or

                IX. When applying a (chosen) decrement table to a pension institution and deriving conclusions from the
                table, it is above all necessary to guard against a mistaken line of thought, which one can easily and
                unknowingly fall into.Namely, one might be tempted to assess and determine the risk involved with an
                upcoming pension obligation for a pensioner based on the average remaining lifetime.
                <br>
                <br>For example, if we see from the decrement table that of a given number of 30-year-old persons, half
                will have died after 28 full years and about 15/16 of a year, and the other half will still be alive, we
                may rightly conclude that, on average, 30-year-olds live another 28 15/16 years.Or if we assume 10,000
                30-year-olds and sum, year by year up to the 50th year, the number of persons still alive each year, and
                that sum is 168,339, and we divide it by 10,000, we may likewise say that 30-year-olds, on their way to
                the end of the 50th year, on average reach 16 8/10 years—assuming we disregard the partial time lived by
                those who die between two given terms.
                <br>
                <br>But if we then go on to say: "Therefore, for every 30-year-old person who requests a life pension,
                we must be prepared to pay for 28 15/16 years," or: "For a person of that age who is to be pensioned
                until the completion of their 50th year, we must expect to pay for 16 8/10 years"—and if we then further
                say: "Therefore, in the first case we require the value of a pension paid over 28 15/16 years, and in
                the second case the value of a pension paid over 16 8/10 years,"—then our reasoning is incorrect, and we
                are demanding too much.

                X. Nevertheless, this line of reasoning appears plausible, and one falls into it quite easily. The
                writers on the subject might well have taken greater care to more deliberately counter and guard against
                it.

                the payments are numerically equal, they are unequal in value with respect to the present, and decrease
                in cash value the further they lie in the future. For example, 10 rigsdalers to be received after one
                year are worth less than 10 rigsdalers received immediately; 10 rigsdalers due in two years are worth
                even less, and so on.
                <br>
                <br>If we now divide the pension period of a pensioner A into two equal halves, the value of the
                pensions in the latter half is less than the value of those in the earlier half.If two other persons, B
                and C, receive the same pension, but B for a shorter time than A and C for an equally longer time than
                A, then the combined value of B’s and C’s pensions is not twice the value of A’s, but slightly less.
                <br>
                <br>If we then add two more persons, D and E, whose pension periods lie even further away from the
                midpoint—i.e., A’s pension time—and we take all five persons A, B, C, D, and E, calculate the total
                value of their pension benefits, and divide that by five, then this fifth part is not equal to the value
                of the pension at the midpoint (i.e., A’s pension), but somewhat less.
                <br>
                <br>And if we imagine 10,000 people, the same holds true. In short: the average total expenditure on all
                pensioners does not correspond exactly to the average pension duration; rather, this average total
                expenditure is noticeably less than the value of a pension paid over the average time span.
                <br>
                <br>Let us suppose the five persons A, B, C, D, and E are all 30 years old.They live:
                <br>A: 28 15/16 years
                <br>B: 20 years
                <br>C: 37 14/16 years
                <br>D: 10 years
                <br>E: 47 14/16 years
                <br>Together they live 144 11/16 years, which is exactly 5 times 28 15/16 years.The pension is 10
                rigsdalers annually, paid semiannually, at an interest rate of 2% per half-year.
                <br>
                <br>Then, the value of pension received is:
                <br>A: 170.525
                <br>B: 136.777
                <br>C: 194.218
                <br>D: 81.757
                <br>E: 212.461
                <br>Totals:
                <br>B and C together: 330.995
                <br>D and E together: 294.218
                <br>A taken twice: 341.05
                <br>A–E total: 795.738→ One fifth of that: 159.148, clearly less than A's individual value of 170.525.
                <br>
                <br>Now take three more persons:
                <br>F lives 8 15/16 years
                <br>G lives 36 15/16 years
                <br>H lives 40 15/16 years
                <br>Pension values:
                <br>F: 74.53
                <br>G: 171.11
                <br>H: 200.59→ Total: 446.22→ One third: 148.74
                <br>Or three others:
                <br>I lives 20 15/16 years
                <br>K lives 24 15/16 years
                <br>L lives 40 15/16 years
                <br>Pension values:
                <br>I: 140.9
                <br>K: 156.887
                <br>L: 200.59→ Total: 498.373→ One third: 166.126
                <br>Sum of all 11 persons (A–L): 1,740.371→ One eleventh: 158.21
                <br>
                <br>Now, finally, suppose 10,000 people, some living longer and others shorter than 28 15/16 years, such
                that their average remaining life is exactly 28 15/16 years —even then, the average total pension cost
                they incur will always be less than the value of a pension paid exactly for 28 15/16 years — no matter
                how individual lifespans vary.

                XII. Könte man den Durchschnitt der Jahre, die von Personen gleichen Alters auf dem Wege zum äussersten
                Ziele des Lebens, oder zujedem beliebigen Zwischenziele durchlebt werden, zum Grunde legen, so würde der
                Kalkulus um vieles erleichtert, da aber dieses nicht angeht, so müsen wir den freilich mühsamen Weg
                einschlagen, daß wir Jahr für Jahr, oder Stufe für Stufe, die aus der anfänglichen Anzal gleich alter
                Personen in jeder Stufe noch übrige Köpfe in Anschlag bringen, den Aufwand, der in jedem Termin von den
                alsdann vorhandenen Personen verursachet wird, auf den Zeitpunkt, da der ganze anfängliche Haufe
                volllzählig beisammen war, zurück diskontiren, diese Diskonti in eine Summe bringen, und diese Summe mit
                der vollen Anzahl der anfänglich vorhandenen Köpfe dividiren, da dann der Quotient den Aufwand gibt, des
                für jedes Individuum insbesondere im Durchschnitt gerechnet werden muß. Dieses ist die in dem
                angenommenen Beispiel 30jähriger Personen näher zu zeigende Aufsummirungsmethode.

                XV.Now we discount the numbers listed under b, by dividing them with the corresponding numbers from the
                first auxiliary table at the respective whole years:

                <br>9863 is discounted using 1.0404
                <br>9726 using 1.0824
                <br>9590 using 1.1262and so on.
                <br>
                <br>Namely: The pension to be paid after one year to 9863 pensioners is equivalent to 9863 / 1.0404 =
                that many yearly pensions valued at present.The pension to be paid after two years to 9726 pensioners
                equals 9726 / 1.0824 present-value pensions. And so on, in the following manner:
                <br>
                <br> from 3.9940090 log of 9863 minus 0.0172004 log of 1.0404 remains 3.9768086 log of 9840

                <br>
                <br>In this way, the numbers under b are transformed into the following discounted values (diskonti):

                XVI.The sum of these discounted values (discounts) is 150,470, and this represents the value of the
                annual pensions that are paid in yearly terms to the persons still alive at each term, drawn from the
                original group of 10,000, until their final death.
                <br>
                <br>That is: 150,470 annual pensions, thought of as paid all at once in present value, are equivalent to
                all the annual pensions that numerically occur over time.The average is 15.047 annual pensions,
                representing the risk associated with each individual 30-year-old.

                XVII.If the pension is not to be fully lifelong, but instead ends at some earlier point before the
                ultimate limit of human life, then the discount values from XV are summed only up to that predetermined
                end point.
                <br>
                <br>For example, if the pension is to cease after 20 years—that is, at the completion of the pensioner’s
                50th year—then only the first 20 discount values are added.Their sum is 117,149, and the average is
                11.7149,so the risk for a 30-year-old person who is to receive an annual pension up to the end of their
                50th year is 11.7149 / 10,000 annual pensions.

                XVIII.If the pension is to begin only after a certain deferral period, one subtracts the value of the
                pension during the deferral period from the total value of the lifelong pension.The remainder is the
                value or risk for the remaining period—from the end of deferral to the end of life.
                <br>
                <br>From 15.047 subtract 11.7149, leaving 3.3321 annual pensions as the risk for a 30-year-old person
                who is to receive an annual pension only beginning upon reaching their 50th year, continuing until
                death.

                XIX.Now we proceed to the combination of two persons, in order to determine the value of a pension:
                <br>for the duration of their joint lives
                <br>or for the time one lives after the death of the other
                <br>or for the total time: jointly first, then the survivor alone
                <br>
                <br>Let us name them A and B, and assume A is 30 years old and B is 40.
                <br>
                <br>It is immediately evident that once we have calculated the value of the pension during their joint
                lifetime, we can simply subtract that from the pension value of A or B alone in order to determine the
                value of the pension during the survivorship (after the other's death).

                The discounted values (discounti) calculated according to the method in section XV give a total sum of
                130,968.This is, therefore, the present value of a lifelong pension for a 40-year-old person, which
                equals 13.0968 annual pensions.

                <br>XXI. We know from section XIV how many individuals of type A (aged 30) remain at the end of each
                year, and from XX how many individuals of type B (aged 40) remain —but not all remain paired; some lose
                their spouse and live a while unpaired.
                <br>To determine how many intact couples are still living together at each point in time, we reason as
                follows:
                <br>Every A and every B originally had a spouse.
                <br>As the entire cohort of A declines, and likewise B, so too does the portion of those initially
                paired.
                <br>For example, after one year, suppose 9863 A and 9811 B are still alive. Then we say:
                <br>Just as 9811 of 10,000 B remain, so of the B’s originally paired with those 9863 A’s, about 9677
                remain.
                <br>Or inversely:
                <br>Just as 9863 of 10,000 A remain, then of the A’s originally paired with the 9811 B’s, 9677 remain.
                <br>So in both cases, the proportion is:
                <br> 10,000 : 9863 = 9811 : 9677
                <br>Thus, for each year, we multiply the corresponding A and B values from tables XIV and XX, and divide
                the result by 10,000 to find the remaining joint couples.
                <br>
                <br>Example with logarithms:
                <br>log(9863) = 3.9940090
                <br>log(9811) = 3.9917133→ log(9677) = 3.9857223
                <br>log(9726) = 3.9879343
                <br>log(9626) = 3.9834459→ log(9362) = 3.9713802and so on.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, we obtain the number of couples still living together at the end of each year as follows:

                The sum of these values is 107,392, hence the value of the pension during the joint lifetime of a
                30-year-old and a 40-year-old person is 10.7392 annual pensions.

                <br>XXIII.The value of the lifelong pension for the 30-year-old person was, according to section XV,

                13.0968;the value of the pension during their joint life, from section XXII, was 10.7392.
                <br>Therefore:

                XXV.A pension that does not begin immediately but only after a deferred period can just as well be
                acquired through a periodic contribution during the deferment period, as through a one-time lump-sum
                payment (on capital basis).
                <br>
                <br>We distribute the previously computed value of the pension over all individuals present in each year
                of the deferment period:
                <br>
                <br>What was previously treated as expenditure during the deferment period is now considered income.
                <br>
                <br>The individuals previously viewed as pensioners are now seen as contributors, and the numerical
                basis remains the same.
                <br>
                <br>Examples:
                <br>
                <br>What 10,404 contributors pay after one year is worth the same as what 10,000 contributors would pay
                now.
                <br>
                <br>According to section XVIII, what 30-year-old persons gradually pay over 20 years is equal in value
                to an immediate payment by 117,149 persons.
                <br>
                <br>According to section XXII, the total contributions of coexisting couples over time equates to an
                instantaneous payment by 107,392 couples.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, we compute:
                <br>
                <br>In XVIII: Divide pension value 3.3321 by 11.7149, to get 0.28443 as the necessary annual
                contribution:
                <br>
                <br>log(3.3321) = 0.5227180log(11.7149) = 1.0687385log(0.28443) = 9.4539795
                <br>
                <br>In XXIII: A’s survivor pension 4.3078 ÷ 10.7392 → contribution = 0.40114       B’s survivor pension
                2.3576 ÷ 10.7392 → contribution = 0.21953
                <br>
                <br>log(4.3078) = 0.6342555log(2.3576) = 0.3724701log(10.7392) = 1.0309638log(0.40114) =
                9.6032917log(0.21953) = 9.3415063

                XXVI.When speaking of a death fund (Sterbelade), where a certain amount is to be paid for funeral
                expenses,we look at the number of individuals who die each year.The number for each term (year) is
                discounted, and these discounted values are then summed.
                <br>
                <br>So, if one takes each number in XIV b (the number of survivors each year) and subtracts it from the
                one just before,one obtains the number of deaths per year, as follows:

                One can conveniently ease the work of discounting in this case, by doing the following:Discount 137
                persons at term 1, then again 137 at term 5;160 at term 6, then again 160 at term 16;205 at term 21,
                then again 205 at term 32;228 at term 33, then again 228 at term 40 — and so forth.The intervening
                intervals may be filled arithmetically (i.e., using averages or interpolation).
                <br>
                <br>The total of the discounted items then becomes 3795, and consequently,the present value of the
                funeral benefit to be paid upon the death of a 30-year-old is0.3795 annual pensions.
                <br>
                <br>If this amount, 3795, is distributed over the 150,470 annual pensions(calculated in section XVI as
                the total cost for the whole cohort),then the required annual contribution is:
                0.025221

                XXVII.So far, only those individuals who are exactly alive at the end of each year have been considered,
                and therefore it is assumed when applying the results to a pension institution that pensions are paid
                once yearly at the year’s end to those still living.
                <br>
                <br>However, often semi-annual payments and payments up to the exact day of death are desired by the
                interested parties.Funeral expenses become necessary immediately upon death,and for good reasons,
                institutions often require a prepayment (prenumeration) when calculating contributions.
                <br>
                <br>To accommodate such wishes fairly,the mortality (decrement) table must be extended to half-year
                terms,and account must be taken of those who die between two terms and survive a portion of the
                interval.

            </section>

            <section id="chap28">
                XXVIII.The extension of the mortality (decrement) table to shorter terms than yearly terms can only be
                done by taking the arithmetic mean between the numbers at any two consecutive terms.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, in table XIV between 10000 and 9863, the value 9932.5 is taken.
                <br>a. Between 9863 and 9726, 9794.5 is taken, and so on.In table XX, between 10000 and 9811, the value
                9966.5 is taken.
                <br>b. Between 9811 and 9626, 9719.5 is taken, etc.We then multiply, following the instructions in XXI,
                these numbers for
                <br>c. the intermediate half-year terms with each other: 9932.5 with 9906.5; 9794.5 with 9719.5,
                etc.,and find the number of pairs at these intermediate terms: 9840; 9520, etc.
                <br>
                <br>These numbers are then discounted with those in the first auxiliary table at the odd terms 1, 3, 5,
                7, etc.The sum of the discounts from a is 155,025; from b 135,910; from c 112,365;additionally, the
                discounts from the full year terms from XV, XX, and XXII are summed, and the total halved:
                <br>155025 + 150470 =305.495 / 2 = 152747
                <br>135910 + 130968 =266.878 / 2 = 133439
                <br>112365 + 107392 = 219757 / 2 = 109877
                <br>
                <br>Thus, by doubling the number of terms, the value of the existence of the 30-year-old person
                increases by 0.2277,the 40-year-old person by 0.2471,and the value of their coexistence by 0.2486.

                XXIX.If we consider the circumstance that pensions shall be calculated up to the exact day of death, and
                that the life annuity of a pensioner who dies between two terms shall be paid pro rata to their heirs up
                to the day of death, and that the pension of a dependent pensioner shall begin from the death day of
                their provider, then we can only approximate the matter by considering half of those who die between two
                terms as having lived the entire term and adding them to those present at the end of the previous term.
                <br>
                <br>Out of 10,000 thirty-year-olds, 9,932 remain after the first half-year term, so 68 have died; we
                take half of these, 34, and discount them with 1.02 from the decrement table. Of the 9,932 remaining at
                the end of the first term, 9,863 remain after the second half-year term, so again 68 died; we again
                count 34 persons for discounting with 1.0404, etc.
                <br>
                <br>The discounts of these increments amount to about 0.2, which is added to the value of existence of a
                30-year-old calculated in XXVIII, namely 15.2747, making it 15.4747, or 0.4277 more than the value
                15.047 found in XV.
                <br>
                <br>The discounts of the increments for the pairs in XXII and XXVIII c amount to about 0.28, which is
                added to the value of coexistence of 30- and 40-year-olds calculated in XXVIII, namely 10.9878, making
                this value 11.2678, or 0.5286 more than the value 10.7392 stated in XXII.

                XXX.If we now subtract from 15.4747, the increased value due to both circumstances of the unilateral
                existence of the 30-year-old person, the likewise increased value 11.2678 of the coexistence of a
                30-year-old and a 40-year-old person, we find 4.2069 as the value of the existence of the 30-year-old
                person after the death of their 40-year-old provider. And if we divide 4.2069 by 11.2678, we have
                0.37336 annual or 0.18968 semiannual contribution. Above, in XXIII, we had 4.3078 as the value of A’s
                existence after separation from B, and in XXV 0.40114 annual contribution in case A.

                XXXI.Now a third circumstance concerning the contribution arises. Namely, if the pension of a dependent
                pensioner is to begin immediately from the death day of the provider, the institution must also be
                secured regarding the punctual payment of contributions up to the moment of separation of coexistence.
                This security exists for the pensioner, but not so easily for the provider who has lost their pensioner
                and has nothing to lose by omitting payment. The safest is therefore to have the contribution prepaid
                from term to term. Accordingly, the number of contributors increases by the fully present initial number
                of 10,000 individuals, and the value of coexistence increases by this contribution for a half-year term.
                Thus, the increased value of coexistence found in XXIX, 11.2678, is further increased by 0.5, making it
                11.7678, and 4.2069 divided by 11.7678 yields the quotient 0.35749.

                XXXII.For the cases described in XVII and XVIII and similar, where reference is made to a goal within
                the utmost limit of life, one finds the proportional increase caused by the mentioned circumstances by
                saying that just as the value found purely from the decrement table for existence until the end of life
                is increased to the augmented value of precisely this existence, so the tabular value of existence up to
                the stated goal is increased to the same value; just as 15.047 in XVI to 15.4747 in XXIX, so 11.7149 in
                XVII and XVIII to 12.048, the value of existence of the 30-year-old up to completion of their 50th
                year.If from 15.4747 in XVIII one subtracts 12.048, the remainder is 3.4267, the value of the further
                existence of the 30-year-old person after passing their 50th year.

                XXXIII.The work of calculating complete tables for a pension institution, as shown from XIV to XXVI, is
                already extensive and laborious, and it would become exceedingly cumbersome if one, considering the
                circumstances mentioned in XXVII, were to treat all cases as thoroughly as shown in XXVIII to XXXI. One
                would rather avoid involving all these mentioned circumstances everywhere and simply accept that income
                and expenditure terms are annual, and that anyone who dies between two terms is not counted, considered,
                or claimed from, but only the pensioner or contributor who is alive exactly at the term receives a
                pension or pays a contribution.

                XXXIV.However, the matter can be simplified by retaining the quantities found according to the
                instructions in XV, XVI, XX, XXII, XXIII, as follows:
                <br>
                <br>a) add 0.425 to the value of a life annuity found in XV, XVI, XX, so that the value of the life
                annuity for the 30-year-old person becomes 15.472, and the value of the life annuity for the 40-year-old
                person becomes 13.5218,
                <br>
                <br>b) reduce by 0.1 the value found in XXIII for the pension of a dependent
                pensioner, so that in case P 30 V 40 this value becomes 4.3078 - 0.1, i.e., 4.2078, and in case P 30 V
                30 becomes 2.3576 - 0.1, i.e., 2.2576;
                <br>
                <br>c) when determining the contribution for the pension of a
                dependent pensioner, increase the coexistence value found in XXII as the divisor by 1, so in XXV instead
                of 10.7392 the divisor 10.7392 + 1, i.e., 11.7392 is taken, and consequently the quotients 0.36696 and
                0.20083 are obtained.

                XXXV.Namely, when one carries out the calculation of the amount of the influence that the aforementioned
                circumstances have, according to the instructions in §§ XXVII–XXXI, in a detailed manner for various
                cases and higher and lower stages of life, one finds that this amount of increase resulting from these
                circumstances mostly comes out to about one. This arises because although in cases of a lower stage of
                life there are more discounted sums to accumulate, on the other hand, in cases of a higher stage, partly
                the decrease of persons from term to term becomes more significant, and partly the numbers lose less
                upon discounting.

                XXXVI.It is understood upon closer consideration of the extensive calculus required for complete tables,
                and thus hardly needs to be mentioned, that it would be too far-reaching if the detailed calculus should
                extend to every combination of different ages. Calculations for simple life annuities are reasonably
                done for every year of human age, but for pensions of dependent pensioners and the like, it can be
                sufficient to make determinations for cases in five-year intervals and fill in intermediate cases
                arithmetically by interpolation.
                <br>
                <br>For example, if the value of the pension for case P 30 V 40 and for case P 30 V 45 is found by
                calculation according to the rule, the difference between these two quantities is divided into five
                parts, and for the intermediate cases P 30 V 41, P 30 V 42, P 30 V 43, P 30 V 44, one such fifth part is
                added each time.

                XXXVII.Finally, I want to remind that when I say, as I stated at the beginning in § III, that in our
                northern Germany, among the various decrement tables, we naturally choose the Süßmilch table, I by no
                means want to deny that this table, like all others existing with various authors of different nations,
                may need and be capable of improvements. I am by no means inclined to discourage or dissuade efforts to
                improve this table as unnecessary or superfluous. Such tables are the foundation of all kinds of support
                institutions, and thus their lesser or greater perfection is of great importance.
                <br>
                <br>Merely mentioning the difference of gender: if one considers that more boys than girls are born, yet
                the majority of boys are lost before puberty, that all censuses show a surplus (of about 5%) of females
                over males, and although the years of childbearing and the cessation of menstruation undoubtedly bring
                hardships for the female sex — though in our times with better obstetrics and better healing methods
                generally, demonstrably far less than in the times of our mothers and grandmothers — one cannot well
                conceal that one and the same table can hardly fit both sexes equally well through all stages and epochs
                of human life.
                <br>
                <br>The higher degree of mortality among boys deserves consideration in a child welfare fund, while the
                hardship of childbearing for women, and the indisputably greater longevity of matrons after successfully
                overcoming the critical period, undoubtedly deserve attention in a widow’s fund: it only depends on
                being able to say and specify something definite upon which a calculation can be based.

            <section id="chap38">
                XXXVIII.Meanwhile, one must not imagine the imperfection of the Süßmilch table, like all other decrement
                tables, to be too great, nor act as if nothing has yet been done, nor deny the possibility of thorough
                support institutions everywhere. Certainly, the Süßmilch table, as it is, is usable; the experience
                presented in this museum in the month of April speaks in favor of the correctly derived inductions from
                this table and proves them tangibly, and the discussion is really only about how one can provide further
                perfection to an already good matter.
                <br>
                <br>It does not at all follow that if we now come to improvements of the Süßmilch table, all our
                previous tables must be recalculated; rather, shorter remedies might be found — for example, against the
                greater longevity of mature women, advice can be given simply by assuming such women at admission to be
                somewhat younger than they actually are, without changing the tables, and one only needs a modification
                indicated by proven experience to specify what the Süßmilch table lacks with regard to these mature
                women, to make this somewhat definite.
                <br>
                <br>For strict accuracy, it would be necessary, instead of the single decrement table derived from
                combined experience of both sexes, to have two such tables, one for one sex and the other for the other
                sex, and then to perform all calculations twice, indeed in cases where dependent pensioners are
                concerned, even three times: once when both provider and pensioner are male, second when both are
                female, and third when they are of different sexes. I wish for these two decrement tables, but I believe
                that when they eventually exist, one will not find the difference in results so great that one is
                inevitably forced to the multiple calculations, but rather that shorter ways will be found.

                XXXIX.The certain way to arrive at a perfect decrement table, whose perfection would also be increased
                by the influence of all local circumstances being reflected in it, would be that by official decree some
                thousands of children, born in one, or a few, at most three consecutive years in a city or province, for
                example the city of Hamburg and its territories, would be registered, and then sustained attention would
                follow them throughout their entire lives, to record the departure of each from the world, while
                occasionally various other significant circumstances could also be noted simultaneously.
                <br>
                <br>Our era would indeed not yet enjoy the benefit of such an arrangement itself, but it would be a tree
                planted for posterity; must not trees be planted by ancestors for the benefit of descendants? And yet
                even our time could partially benefit from the experience in respect to widow’s funds.
