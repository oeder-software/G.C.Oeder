                Translator's Preface.<br><br>

                The name Georg Christian Oeder is primarily known in Denmark for two reasons. He was the creator and,
                from 1760, the
                initiator of the publication of the magnificent botanical work "Flora Danica," and from 1769, he was, in
                writing and
                speech, one of those who prepared the liberation of the peasants. His other activities were many and
                varied, but they
                take a back seat to these two. He did not leave behind any diaries or any form of autobiography upon his
                death in 1791.
                However, Gerhard Anton von Halem, who had known him closely since 1773 and worked with him, has set a
                beautiful memorial
                for him in his book "Andenken an Oeder." But what is the reason that, almost 200 years after von Halem's
                book from 1793,
                I am translating it into Danish?
                <br><br>
                One of my great-grandmothers was given the name Caroline Mathilde Oeder at her baptism in 1832. This was
                a clear tribute
                to the queen whom Georg Christian Oeder so chivalrously defended in 1772. Also, in relation to Count
                Struensee, he
                showed considerable courage; for although he likely did not care much for him as a person, he admired
                Struensee's
                progressive activities and refused to testify against him during the trial that led to Struensee's
                conviction and
                execution. The consequences were - if not catastrophic, then at least highly unpleasant for Oeder
                himself. By a
                "distinguished" appointment, he was removed from Denmark to Oldenburg, where he spent the last 18 years
                of his life.
                However, he enjoyed the satisfaction there that many of the plans he had outlined for Denmark were
                implemented to the
                benefit of the small duchy, where he was held in high regard.
                <br><br>
                In studying Georg Christian Oeder, I found a not insignificant similarity with my personal interests and
                certain
                viewpoints. For example, both Oeder and I have proposed plans for coordinated education and the
                resulting collaboration
                on an exchange basis for all of Europe - he in the botanical field in the 1760s, and I in insurance
                education in the
                1950s. Oeder's plan failed at the time, despite many support measures; mine succeeded with help from
                Swiss, German, and
                English sides, and it thrives well after more than 25 years.
                <br><br>
                Life's coincidences have led to, long before my studies of Oeder's life, I first had my daily walk and
                work for seven
                years in the Amaliegade pavilion, which belonged to Frederiks Hospital, and where it turns out Oeder
                lived for about ten
                years. Next, I have worked daily for 37 years in the Bernstorff Palace, which was built and inhabited by
                the man who
                called Oeder to Denmark in 1752 - here Oeder also frequented. Several times over the years, I have
                visited the house on
                the corner of Stormgade and Frederiksholms Kanal (then: Kalleboderne 287), where Oeder lived the last
                three years in
                Copenhagen.
                <br><br>
                After my interest in him was aroused, I stood in the church in Ansbach, where he was baptized in 1728, I
                visited his
                grandmother's house in Feuchtwangen, where he lived from his third to his ninth year, and the dean's
                house in the same
                town, where his father moved in as dean and pastor. In Untere Karspüle opposite the university in
                Göttingen, I looked at
                the house where Oeder's admired teacher, Albrecht von Haller, lived and walked in the botanical garden
                that Haller had
                established, where he imparted the botanical interest to his students. And I have in the city of
                Oldenburg, from where
                Denmark once fetched its royal house, shopped in the supermarket that now lies where Rittergasse 16 once
                stood, the
                house where Oeder and von Halem lived together for three years, and looked at the row of houses on
                Marktplatz, where
                Oeder lived in one of the houses until his death. In the cemetery outside the city, by the chapel at the
                far end, stands
                a monumental gravestone shaped by Wiedewelt, on whose back von Halem has composed a beautiful text,
                which is now
                unreadable but fortunately known from Halem's book.
                <br><br>
                In translating Halem's book, I have sought to some extent to retain the tone of the 18th century without
                excessively
                using expressions from that era's Danish. Place names, almost all of which in the book are given in
                their German form, I
                have translated as much as possible according to the local name. For the benefit of later readers of the
                translation, I
                have inserted section headings in the book's continuous text (168 octavo) and further used these for a
                detailed table of
                contents, which actually constitutes a "curriculum vitae." Additionally, besides the book's own notes,
                not all of which
                are included, I have formed a few descriptions of people and conditions that the modern reader might
                find useful.
                <br><br>
                Finally, I find it appropriate to thank those whose interest, inspiration, and support for my work have
                given me the
                desire to undertake the translation work: This includes landscape architect Vibeke Dahl, Hårlev, whose
                great-grandfather
                Nicolaj Gotfred Oeder, as an orphan, was raised and educated by my great-great-grandfather, while my
                great-grandmother
                was a child in the home. Also, thanks to lecturer, cand. polit. Niels Bolwig, Aarhus, whose connection
                to the
                Matthiessen family in Altona made Oeder's only daughter his distant great-aunt. And finally, thanks to
                chancellor Lizzi
                Øder, the only one in the circle who still bears the name - albeit spelled in modern Danish.
                <br><br>
                Last but not least, I thank my wife for her tolerance of my periodic absences from our own century and
                for her
                participation in my travels and research - she really has no personal connection to the subject. The
                translation was
                completed during some recuperation weeks after a flu at the end of winter.

                    Introduction
                </h2>
                It is my intention to look back upon the career of a man—a man through whose efforts human knowledge and
                understanding
                have been increased in several fields—a man whose work has brought greater happiness to a large segment
                of the
                population—a man who is worthy of being called: a benefactor of the human race. Who would not gladly
                linger with me at
                the grave of this noble person? My reason for weaving a wreath around the deceased's urn lies in the
                long-standing
                friendship that bound me to him. It also lies in my possession of some personal written notes from the
                deceased, and in
                the trust that his worthy widow has shown me by encouraging me to undertake this task. To her—first of
                all—I dedicate
                these pages.

                    Georg Christian Oeder, Edler von Oeder, was the third son of Georg Ludwig Oeder, Doctor of Theology
                    and Dean in
                    Feuchtwangen in the principality of Onolzbach. His mother was Margrete Sybille, née Hamberger. He
                    was born on February
                    3, 1728, in the town of Ansbach, where his father was then serving as the vice-principal of the
                    gymnasium. When he was
                    just three years old, his righteous grandmother, who had been widowed after the dean's passing, took
                    him in at
                    Feuchtwangen and raised him until he was nine years old, when his father assumed the deanship in
                    Feuchtwangen and took
                    his son back. Initially, he allowed him to partake in the public instruction at the local Latin
                    school. However, from
                    the age of twelve, his father took over his son's education, which already revealed his fondness for
                    mathematics,
                    arithmetic, and drawing. By Easter of 1746, he was ready to be admitted to the University of
                    Göttingen.

                    The medical sciences, with their manifold connections to related fields, seemed to exert an immense
                    attraction on
                    researchers and immediately became the focus of his academic pursuits from the beginning of his
                    university career.
                    <br><br>
                    Segner was his teacher in mathematics. He attended medical lectures with Richter and Brendel.
                    However, his most
                    important teacher was Haller, whose almost daily instruction he benefited from for three years.
                    Under Haller's guidance,
                    he also studied botany, and Oeder never missed the botanical excursions organized by his great
                    teacher for his students.
                    <br><br>
                    The association with Haller also fostered his taste for the fine sciences and specifically led him
                    to the study of the
                    English language and literature, which retained its appeal for him throughout his life. Richardson
                    was writing his
                    masterpiece, "Clarissa," at that time. As the book was printed, it arrived in installments in
                    Göttingen. Oeder often
                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img1" src="/img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>

                </aside>
                recalled in his later years the pleasure with which Haller read it and subsequently discussed it
                with his friends,
                providing summaries. After the "sleeping draught scene," Haller could not hide his displeasure with
                the author. "He has
                let her fall," he exclaimed, "and truly, he cannot lift her up again." Nevertheless, Richardson did
                lift her up. The
                following installment brought the "knife scene," and Haller's admiration for Richardson's genius was
                all the greater.
                <br><br>
                In the autumn of 1749, Oeder received his doctoral degree. The dissertation he prepared and defended
                under the
                chairmanship of Professor Segner was titled "De derivatione et rivulsione per venesectionem."

                At the suggestion of his compatriot, Camerer, Oeder then went to Schleswig as a practicing physician.
                His access to the
                home of State Councillor Ericius, whose sons he had studied with in Göttingen, led to his first
                marriage. Count
                Schmettau, who was stationed in Schleswig with his regiment as a general at that time, valued the young
                man and warmly
                recommended him to Count Bernstorff. In 1751, Bernstorff moved to Copenhagen as the Danish Foreign
                Minister and Chief
                Secretary of the German Chancellery. Bernstorff sought further information from Haller, and—Oeder's
                fortune was made.

                worthy
                scholars, such as Klopstock, Cramer, Berger, and several others, also demonstrated his wisdom in
                selecting talents by
                appointing Oeder. The assembly of all these men will forever mark the era of Frederick V within the
                sciences in
                Denmark's history.

                </aside>
                At the University of Copenhagen, there was a need for a botanical institute, and Oeder was to be
                employed for its
                establishment. According to academic laws, a public dissertation was required before appointment to a
                professorship.
                Oeder chose as the subject of his dissertation the Hallerian theory of irritability, a then-new theory.
                According to
                experts, his dissertation—"De irritabilitate"—was one of the best on this subject, although Haller was
                not completely
                satisfied with it. Oeder had his own thoughts on the matter, aligning with Haller yet not merely
                following him.
                <br><br>
                The public defense of the dissertation did not go particularly well. Oeder was not as skilled in
                disputation, especially
                compared to the contemporary physician in Funen, Dr. Eichel. The defense was so unfavorable that the
                government did not
                find it advisable to immediately appoint him to the university.
                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img5" src="/img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>

                <br><br>
                Instead, he was made a royal professor. The botanical institute, established in 1752 at royal expense,
                was independent
                of the university, and its management was entrusted solely to Oeder under the direction of Count Moltke.
                The intention
                was for the institute to eventually merge with the university. The mere fact of entrusting a "foreigner"
                with this
                task—setting aside his inexperience with lecturing—and sidelining the university, all under the direct
                protection of the
                court, immediately set the university against the new institute and created many opponents for Oeder.
                <br><br>
                Nevertheless, the endeavor got off to a good start. The botanical garden was established near the
                customs house and at
                the entrance to the harbor. Collections for a library and a collection of natural history rarities also
                began.
                <br><br>
                Finally, at the beginning of 1754, Oeder was appointed professor of botany at the University of
                Copenhagen, and the
                following year he embarked on his botanical journeys through the Danish states to collect for "Flora
                Danica."

                    Botanical Journeys - Especially in Norway

                    He began in Norway, a country he grew very fond of and spoke warmly about whenever the opportunity
                    arose.
                    <br><br>
                    In the first year, 1755, he explored the areas around Christiania and Kongsberg. In 1756, he
                    traveled through
                    Gudbrandsdalen, over the Dovre Mountains to Trondheim, and from there over Røros back to
                    Christiania. The third summer
                    he was engaged in the diocese of Christiansand (along the coast), on both sides of Lindesnes. He
                    also passed through the
                    Heckfjell mountain area and Telemark. In the summer of 1758, he traveled along the coast from
                    Stavanger, through the
                    diocese of Bergen to Trondheim; and in the summer of 1759, he explored parts of Nordland to Rana.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout his life, he could not praise enough the modesty, coupled with good-naturedness and
                    clear, sound reasoning,
                    that he particularly found among the Norwegian farmers.
                    <br><br>
                    The traveling botanist, more than anyone else, has the opportunity to study a nation's psyche,
                    investigate the
                    deficiencies in its state, understand the essence of its legal system, trace the sources of its
                    occupations and their
                    obstacles, as well as its customs in general—he sees how things present themselves and how to grasp
                    everything in its
                    course.
                    <br><br>
                    His position as a researcher and scholar gives him access to the houses of the noble and gains him
                    the trust of learned
                    individuals in all classes. But his duties also often lead him off the beaten path, requiring him to
                    seek shelter in the
                    huts of the impoverished.
                    <br><br>
                    For this man, who does not bear any intimidating official mark but seems merely to direct his
                    attention to the plants in
                    the field—for him, both the farmer's and the citizen's hearts open without reservation; the poor's
                    as well as the
                    rich's; the teacher's as well as the tradesman's; and ultimately, alongside the beautiful knowledge
                    of plants and
                    flowers, the observer has acquired the even more beautiful knowledge of human nature.

                Oeder was such an observer. Rousseau, the human researcher, became a plant researcher at the end of his
                life. Oeder,
                while searching for plants, gained knowledge about people and nations.
                <br><br>
                But he did not merely acquire this knowledge; he also used it for the good of the state—the state to
                which he had
                devoted his work.
                <br><br>
                Regarding his botanical works, which would later be expressed in "Flora," he could only inform his
                benefactors,
                Bernstorff and Moltke, to a limited extent. Therefore, in addition to this, he also sent them travel
                reports and
                politico-economic reflections on Norway, which the ministers would have found all the more welcome since
                they only knew
                the country through the finance departments and their annual accounts, but otherwise were only slightly
                informed about
                the specific needs of this country.
                <br><br>
                For example, he described the possibility of improving the healthcare system, grain prices, the
                development of
                agriculture in mountainous regions, the road network, the benefit of abolishing the Norwegian odel right
                (the right of
                birth and primogeniture), which weighed down the population as a hindrance to development; he quoted a
                Norwegian
                farmer's statement that it would not look good in Norway until the forests were cleared (!); he reported
                on many
                enterprises that deserved the attention and support of Nordic citizens, merchants, and other capable
                persons.
                <br><br>
                Similarly, on one occasion, he referred to an economic report (by Udsterns-Klosterhof) on Norwegian
                agriculture and its
                improvement, with special reference to tenanted estates, common lands, and clearing practices.
                <br><br>
                I explicitly mention the specific things about which he wrote and concerning which manuscripts are
                before me.
                <br><br>
                Even if, for the most part, they may be too locally oriented to interest a larger and particularly
                German audience, the
                Danish-Norwegian patriot, who is thereby made aware of the conditions, may wish to deepen his knowledge
                and learn how a
                thinker like Oeder assessed the state of his homeland.

                    However, Oeder's travel reports also contain sections of general interest and contributions to
                    philosophical knowledge
                    about a country.
                    <br><br>
                    Allow me to quote a passage:
                    <br><br>
                    "In Stavanger county, the diocese of Bergen, and in Nordland, generally along the North Sea, there
                    are many glaciers or
                    areas covered with perpetual snow; but in the interior of the country, they are smaller or less
                    frequent. The
                    Jostedalsbreen glacier extends through seven parishes in three administrative districts, and comes
                    as close to the sea
                    as half a quarter mile at one point. The reason for the presence of these glaciers is not that the
                    mountains by the sea
                    are higher than those inland; rather, it is that the sides of the mountains facing the sea
                    constantly attract mists and
                    clouds coming from the sea, and 'brecciate'—and due to the high humidity, the snow is brought into a
                    state between snow
                    and ice. I was clearly convinced of this when, in the last days of June 1757, I traveled across
                    Heckfjell and
                    Langfjellene from ESE to WNW. There was little snow on the east side, but as soon as I reached the
                    highest point of the
                    mountain and the road descended again, almost everything was covered with snow."
                    <br><br>
                    "Anyone interested in engaging with the many 'cosmo-theories' about the origin of mountains, etc.,
                    can take the
                    following circumstance into consideration, which I do not remember having read in other descriptions
                    of mountains. The
                    highest mountain peaks in the interior of the country do not present a solid rock formation, but a
                    'concave' surface,
                    surrounded by loose fragments or large stones of all shapes and sizes, and by small stones,
                    boulders, and gravel, to the
                    extent that footholds cannot be found."
                    <br><br>
                    "A breach of an inserted wall can in miniature give an idea of the sight of the peaks."
                    <br><br>
                    "These peaks are quite bare, and one can hardly find on them even a handful of a certain type of
                    alpine plant, although
                    around the ridge at the foot of such a peak there are plenty of plants. These 'rudera', if I may
                    term them so, are
                    certainly not merely the effect of gravity, such as the fall from a steep and projecting cliff. One
                    can imagine nothing
                    other than that it has arisen from an internal shaking and an inwardly outward force."
                    <br><br>
                    "Anyone who finds pleasure in Alex. Moros' system could easily imagine the peak of Grindfjell in
                    Valdres as the 'pot' of
                    a burnt-out volcano, although otherwise I have noticed no trace of a fire, lava, or the like."
                    <br><br>
                    "Another curiosity is certain large stones, as large as small houses, which one can see lying
                    loosely on the mountains
                    here and there, on surfaces where there are no mountain peaks for the nearest half a mile from which
                    such a stone could
                    have rolled."
                    <br><br>
                    "In Norway, there is no evidence for the idea that the surface of the sea falls in relation to the
                    mainland, which is
                    discussed extensively in Sweden in our time. Gyskø on Sundmør, Tiottøen in Helgeland is mentioned in
                    old Norse history.
                    They are still only slightly above the surface of the sea today, and necessarily more elevated if
                    the Celsian perception
                    was right. Moreover, in no other country is there better opportunity than Norway to leave a legacy
                    to posterity, after
                    all, these disputes can once and for all be resolved. Indeed, in one of the so-called 'deep cracks,'
                    where the mountains
                    stand vertically on all sides, for example, inside Lysefjord (in Ry fylke), a line can be drawn on
                    such a rock wall and
                    permanently engraved, which will stand undisturbed, connected with changes at ebb and flow and in
                    different seasons."
                    <br><br>
                    "The view one has in the interior of such a bay as Lysefjord is stunning. One can imagine a mountain
                    seen far out to
                    sea, cut through in profile. One imagines being at the base of this profile section standing at the
                    bottom of a deep
                    canyon. Roughly in this situation, when one leaves the boat to climb the mountain in the fjord, the
                    cliff walls on the
                    sides of the deep trench are completely vertical, the water itself is only a few shotgun widths
                    wide, and the canyon
                    opening to the sky is not much wider; the edges cannot be seen without lying flat on one's back.
                    Then comes the darkness
                    and the roar of the streams rushing down from the cliff walls. It is a terrifying place to stay."
                    <br><br>
                    "Well, we have to tear ourselves away to get back to the main purpose of the trip: collecting
                    plants."

                    The creation of Flora Danica
                </h2>

                Oeder's companion, Martin Rössler, made on-the-spot drawings of the fresh collected plants. These
                drawings were then
                engraved in copper by his father, Michael Rössler, resulting in the gradual publication of "Flora
                Danica" starting in
                the autumn of 1762. Each installment consisted of 60 copper engravings, a work that at the time had few
                equals and was
                acclaimed by connoisseurs as a true ornament of the century.
                <br><br>
                (Note: He created ten installments alone. However, many illustrations in the subsequent installments
                were also created
                by him.)
                <br><br>
                By 1766, two volumes containing 360 copperplate engravings were completed. In Germany, this work was
                esteemed with the
                same regard as the works of Natterer, Willes, or Winckelmann. "Früchte Deutschen Bodens"; when such a
                work achieves
                perfection, what matter is it that it was produced in a foreign land?
                <br><br>
                Not only did German regions on this side of the Eider River, along the Elbe and Weser rivers, contribute
                to the
                illustrated plants, but the work was also published in German, Danish, and Latin—completely crafted by
                German hands. It
                was the fruit of a meticulous naturalist, a researcher who honored both nations, those who educated him
                and those who
                rewarded him.
                <br><br>
                The proper way to acquaint oneself with plants is through observation in nature itself. Yet, even when
                led there, how
                many acquaintances must we forgo simply because we did not find them nearby?
                <br><br>
                In dried plants, one does not always find nature; their use is also short-lived. Descriptions are not
                always sufficient
                for a master of the art. It is not easy to transform the "conceived" image into a fantasy and to gather
                the scattered
                parts of a plant into a whole description.
                <br><br>
                But a reliable engraving, paired with an accurate description, is a boon for both experts and amateurs.
                Through the
                description, the engraving speaks, bringing even its smallest, nearly invisible parts to the viewer's
                attention. Through
                the engraving, the description is embodied and merges into an image.
                <br><br>
                "Had one," Oeder asserts, "since the invention of printing and copperplates, immediately brought more
                illustrations
                instead of incomplete descriptions from the beginning, botanists would largely have been spared the
                arduous labor they
                have had to apply to 'synonymy'. There would have been less reason to complain about the abundance of
                names. Knowledge
                of plants would have been more widely disseminated, and much more progress would have been made
                regarding knowledge of
                the utility of plants."

                The copper engravings in "Flora Danica" were executed in a somewhat unconventional manner, without
                cross-hatching, so
                that they could "carry" colors when colored, but they could also stand alone in black ink, which
                comprised the majority.
                For this reason, the engravings were shaded and meticulously crafted with engraving techniques. The
                drawings, even in
                the smallest detail, are precise, clean, and pleasing, exhibiting colors of exquisite beauty. The
                plants, including
                alpine plants, were drawn from specimens in a fresh, vibrant state. This was a rare advantage! However,
                it was
                necessary, if one aimed to express nature as it appears in reality, to depict the plant in its natural
                growth form,
                capturing its free stance, full shape, the expression of its diverse parts, and especially the accurate
                representation
                of the natural product in its habitat. This approach yields a free, comprehensive drawing that not only
                outlines the
                plant but also conveys its body, substance, and texture!

                This is a brief description of what Oeder accomplished through "Flora Danica." It is a work for which
                future generations
                will remember his name, not only for its local utility or association with specific regions. The Danish
                territories span
                a vast expanse of land, from the Elbe River to the Arctic Ocean, from the 53rd to the 70th latitude. The
                soil varies
                immensely, and it is crucial for the abundance of mountain plants, shoreline plants, and marine plants.
                Experts have
                identified 68 species in the first two volumes that are not found in Linne's "Flora Suecica."

                    Advanced Botanical Plans - for the Whole of Europe

                The Danish "Flora" was intended to encompass four-fifths of English plants and five-sixths of North
                German plants. Here,
                the actual task expanded beyond the Danish states, aiming to benefit a larger part of northern Europe.
                Oeder's grand
                plan was for "Flora Danica" to include the European flora from approximately 20 degrees north latitude,
                with two or
                three more southern floras to be added subsequently. This approach aimed to unify all of Europe into a
                botanical
                overview, akin to what Zimmermann later accomplished in zoology.
                <br><br>
                To facilitate easier use by the primary intended country, the government distributed 55 copies within
                the Danish states
                to trusted individuals. These copies were accessible to any subject who wished to view them and learn
                about their own
                country's botanical richness.
                <br><br>
                Alongside the publication of this significant work, Oeder also authored "Einleitung zu der
                Kräuterkentniss" in Latin and
                German. Scholars appreciated his philosophical spirit evident in this work, admired his thoughtful
                writing style, and
                praised his modesty, which was demonstrated by his thorough analysis of existing methods before
                proposing his own. In
                the German edition, he naturally expressed all technical terms in German, reflecting his complete
                understanding of the
                subject matter and language without being bound by his predecessors.
                <br><br>
                This work by Oeder received such acclaim abroad that Gouan in Montpellier used it as the basis for his
                standard
                lectures, and it was similarly esteemed in Edinburgh. In 1765, Oeder was elected as a corresponding
                member of the
                scientific society in Montpellier, following his earlier membership in the scientific society in
                Göttingen.
                <br><br>
                His final botanical work was a catalog of wild plants associated with "Flora Danica," published in Latin
                and German
                between 1769 and 1770.

                    (d. 1805), whose
                    evaluation I have previously followed, with these words:

                "Without throwing around many technical terms, there is so much true philosophy about art therein; so
                much distinguished
                critical learning is scattered therein; (and yet one could behold nature as it had never been seen
                before), so much of
                the full, wonderful, and peculiar nature is depicted; the observed is so concentrated and so aptly
                expressed in words,
                which not infrequently sound new and always felicitously chosen - in this manner has botanical knowledge
                entirely gained
                thereby."
                <br><br>
                - "Oeder," thus says this fine critic further, "Oeder has shown the hitherto best method (the Linnaean),
                he has used it
                and - abandoned it. A witty connoisseur thought that to create an audience for his own works, Oeder
                should either have
                tied himself (to his predecessors), or he should have raised an outcry against them. But he does not
                seem slavishly to
                be able to bring himself to graze in others' fields, and he seems to have too much respect for real
                merit to indulge in
                condemnatory reproach, a method which certain newer botanists had actually adopted as their "tone,"
                although they
                constantly reached for Linnaeus's crutch.
                <br><br>
                Taking a middle ground, he made great strides towards a natural system, actually bringing it closer than
                any of his
                predecessors."
                <br><br>
                Encouraged by ministers Bernstorff and Moltke, he continued to submit several reports on finances and
                other subjects of
                political science, and especially after 1760, there arose a desire in him to be applied in areas of this
                kind.

                    Oeder's Reports on Norway's Socioeconomic Situation
                    <br>
                </h2>
                <p>


                    Oeder's reports became increasingly significant over time.
                    <br><br>
                    He was gradually convinced that in Norway there were fewer issues to pinpoint among the farming
                    population compared to
                    the citizens. Agriculture itself had progressed as far as it could alone, and further improvement
                    could only be expected
                    through expanding the efforts of civil professions.
                    <br><br>
                    "In my opinion," he later stated elsewhere, "Norway is more densely populated than Denmark, when
                    comparing uncultivated
                    land in one place with uncultivated land in another. One must have seen Norway and similar
                    mountainous lands with one's
                    own eyes to truly imagine how small the cultivated spots constitute."
                    <br><br>
                    "When in our Danish territories I find villages named 'towns,' and farmers named 'citizens,' - when
                    in Norway I observe
                    the farmers' highly renowned skills in making their household goods, tools, and clothing themselves,
                    both are proof to
                    me of a disadvantageous arrangement in both realms. I believe that the 'towns' in Denmark are
                    deprived of opportunities
                    for civil professions and urban livelihoods, and that the farmers in Norway should have had towns
                    with professional
                    trades closer by."
                    <br><br>
                    "The Nordland area begins about 20 miles from Trondheim and extends all the way to Finnmark over a
                    stretch of 70 to 80
                    miles. Its population totals nearly 50,000 people. This entire district is tied to trade with the
                    cities of Bergen and
                    Trondheim; the greatest commercial connection further extends to the more remote mountainous
                    regions, with the nearest
                    areas of Nordland lying 70 miles away, and the farthest 120 to 130 miles. On such a journey, one to
                    two months of the
                    short summer are spent, and during this time the country loses several hundred of its best men, who
                    are so necessary for
                    agriculture and farming in general."
                    <br><br>
                    "The most significant part of Nordland's products consists of fish, a commodity significantly
                    diminished by delays in
                    processing and sales procedures, causing prices to rise with each intermediary."
                    <br><br>
                    "From both these considerations, the necessity of a city specifically for these Nordland areas
                    becomes evident.
                    Simultaneously, this city could become the best seat for Icelandic, Faroese, and Finnmark trade, as
                    well as a hub for
                    transshipment trade to Archangelsk."
                    <br><br>
                    "Iceland was originally a Norwegian colony. Naturally, the daughter should stick with the mother.
                    From the Nordland
                    area, the sea crossing is only half as short as the journey to Copenhagen, which unquestionably lies
                    too far away to
                    serve as a transshipment point for Icelandic trade. The trade in Iceland must therefore be made
                    free, and the island
                    should no longer be deprived of the advantages that come with free competition. At the very least,
                    one could first make
                    some port free and store a small warehouse at the king's expense as a contingency in case of need,
                    if trade and supplies
                    do not meet expectations."

                "If ever the plan to establish this city in Nordland were to be implemented, in Oeder's opinion, the
                area around the
                mouths of the rivers Ranen and Wessen would deserve consideration. 'Their arrangement,' he said,
                'would essentially cost
                nothing other than the will to do so, the removal of obstacles, and allowing people to exploit
                nature's gifts to the
                best of their knowledge and understanding. Here - as in hundreds of other projects - it is a truth
                that a government
                without expenses, simply by removing moral and political obstacles, can infinitely more easily
                promote human initiative
                than through costly support measures."
                <br><br>
                During the time when the current reigning king ascended the throne (1766), Oeder's political
                proposals became more
                frequent on the recommendation of Bernstorff.
                <br><br>
                His considerations extended across various subjects and branches of government administration,
                including finances.

                    The Military Aspect of Contemporary Society
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder certainly did not overlook the Danish military establishment.
                    <br><br>
                    In a particular memorandum, he criticized the changed measures that had been taken in this area
                    since 1763, stating
                    loudly: "The first concern a state must strive for is to base its existence in relation to its
                    neighbors on its own
                    internal strength. Any nation large enough to be called a nation can lay claim to this independence.
                    Nature has
                    designated the natural border of the Danish state between Trave and Elbe, and this can be defended
                    with 70 to 80,000 men
                    - (not with 30,000 as our generals would have us believe).
                    <br><br>
                    This strength can be sought within the country's borders - and found.
                    <br><br>
                    National forces must be the main concern, with recruited troops only a secondary matter; for with
                    them, nothing can be
                    accomplished, no matter how much or how little one rearranges things. If the farming population in
                    Norway can raise
                    30,000 soldiers, then the farming population in Denmark and its German territories should
                    proportionately be able to
                    provide 45, 40, or at the very least 30,000 men. Educating them depends on the officers' will and
                    diligence. The example
                    from the Navy proves the possibility that in the Army, one can just as well rely on one's own
                    resources. The defense of
                    the homeland is not too costly, and even though sufficient foreign hands can be obtained and paid
                    for by Denmark, one
                    should still use one's own resources in the kingdom. A major flaw in the previous organization of
                    the national army lies
                    in the fact that the officers who have once been appointed to the army settle there for a lifetime,
                    instead of service
                    in the army being a path to promotion, something the officers in the national army had considered to
                    be a matter of
                    course.....etc."
                    <br><br>
                    However, Oeder also felt, and he expressed it already in this treatise, that the situation of the
                    Danish farmer would be
                    a significant obstacle to such an arrangement.

                The investigation into the situation of the peasant class and the means for its improvement aroused
                general attention at
                that time.
                <br><br>
                Oeder's merit shines brightest here, and the matter itself is so important for any true friend of
                humanity that it is a
                pleasing duty for the biographer to shed light on the secret of injustice, namely that the peasant class
                had been
                deprived of the intended improvement for so long.
                <br><br>
                To form a clear idea of the state of peasants in Denmark, one must distinguish between three different
                periods.
                <br><br>
                The first lengthy period lasts until the change of government under Frederik III (1660), during which
                the people were
                subjugated by the aristocrats, who faced insufficient resistance, and where the peasant's son was also
                bound to his
                birthplace.
                <br><br>
                <aside class="asideright"> <img id="img14" src="/img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio14" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                The second period extends from this change of government until 1702, when Frederik IV abolished
                Vornedskabet (a form of
                serfdom), in order to - as stated in the ordinance - "create greater desire, courage, and interest in
                work, and thereby
                create greater initiative, so that when they saw that they and their children could in the future
                possess the land for
                which they worked, they could find greater encouragement to risk their lives for king and country."
                <br><br>
                The third period extends from this ordinance up to the present day; a period that confirmed the truth
                that even the most
                well-intentioned ordinances remain without effect, and indeed often become harmful, when the state and
                people were not
                sufficiently prepared through preliminary measures to accept the benefits intended and planned for them.
                According to
                Frederik IV's beautiful ordinance, the peasant was to be free; however, this presupposed that the
                peasant felt happy on
                his land, and that the excellent prosperity bound him through his own choice to his homeland. But how
                could the peasant
                have this feeling of prosperity?
                <br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"> <img id="img15" src="/img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio15" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                Agriculture found itself in the most miserable condition. The land burdened with taxes had no value, and
                to avoid the
                unbearable weight of taxes, entire farms were handed over to the king. The sons of peasants left their
                father's farm and
                their birthplace and went where their incentive led them. Naturally, this had a detrimental effect on
                the country's
                defense. A significant departure from the Landmilits (peasant militia) was noted, which was further
                increased by the
                worsening of the land soldier's service, as officers arbitrarily handed over the land soldiers to
                recruited regiments.
                Complaints about these coercive measures reached the ears of Christian VI. He wanted to do good and
                completely abolished
                the Landmilits in 1730. He believed that now every man in the realm would appreciate his happiness more
                and feel more
                encouraged to defend the fatherland. But precisely because this "happiness" was lacking, the consequence
                of the
                abolition was that the Danish peasant more frequently abandoned the plow, farms lay deserted, and the
                country was
                deprived of its strong army.
                <br><br>
                Already in 1731, Christian found himself compelled to re-establish the Landmilits.
                <br><br>
                A series of ordinances followed, which determined the length of service, until finally, the ordinance of
                April 13, 1764
                established the landlord's right over his people in such a way that from the end of their fourth year of
                childhood until
                their fortieth year, the peasants were subject to the law.
                <br><br>
                In this way, the freedom intended for the peasant class by Frederik IV was annulled. For who can be
                called free when
                from the fourth year of childhood to the fortieth year, one is bound to one's birthplace - that is,
                throughout the
                period when a person should settle?
                <br><br>
                It is clear that an improvement in the prosperity of the peasants is the great condition for freedom.
                But how this
                prosperity could be most effectively promoted and reconciled with the interests of landlords and the
                defense condition
                of the state was the great problem that divided opinions in the decades when Oeder traveled the royal
                lands as a
                botanist.

                As a preface, Arthur Young's true words serve: "Often one writes thick books filled with good advice for
                agriculture,
                where one should rather engage in political principles. To tell how to cultivate turnips, cabbage,
                carrots, alfalfa,
                clover, and other similar products in England with the finest advantage, and to report it to farmers who
                with their
                stock must pay for France's farmer's tax, which requires them to deliver every tenth piece of their
                products - to tell
                it to farmers in a country where export of products is prohibited but where import is allowed, or where
                poverty is so
                great that the farmer cannot find a market for his goods; what are all these good advices other than
                frivolous mockery
                of quite ordinary human reason!)
                <br><br>
                Count Moltke prompted Oeder, whom he considered a thinker because of his other writings, to also bring
                this problem to
                light. Oeder did so with his usual acumen and boldness.

                    and
                    paved the way for
                    subsequent investigations, for which the Danish peasant in the following centuries can thank for his
                    greater prosperity.
                    <br><br>
                    "One must," says Oeder, "arm oneself with strict impartiality so that in the discussion of this
                    problem
                    one can pave the
                    way between contrasting opinions. On one side, the despotism of the landlords - those who fight for
                    the
                    pleasure of
                    ruling over their fellow citizens as if it were a 'majestic right,' in anxious concern that the
                    peasant
                    class will gain
                    something at their expense; outdated prejudices that believe no other condition is possible than the
                    once established
                    one.
                    <br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"><a id="img17href" href=""> <img id="img17" src="/img/ryberg.jpg"></a>
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio17" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                On the other side: unreasonable reproaches against the landlords as a whole, as if it were their
                resistance hindering
                any good; devout wishes without knowing where the real faults lie, an impatience that wishes to enforce
                everything by
                force and not give considerations time to mature."
                <br><br>
                His opinion on the matter itself was that the condition where the peasant cultivates his own land is
                preferable to the
                previous one where he works without owning anything and with restricted freedom.
                <br><br>
                "Therefore," he said, "I believe that the state of agriculture in a nation will be best where the land
                is completely
                divided into plots no larger than can be tended by their occupant without serfdom; where each occupant
                can regard such a
                plot as his property and treat it accordingly; and where the rights of the higher estates are limited to
                specific taxes
                on these plots. Depending on how far or near a state deviates from this condition, it will become less
                advantageous,
                perhaps even harmful.
                <br><br>
                From this described state, a larger population grows, and with this population, all the happy
                consequences thereof
                develop:
                The development of civil professions, a more secure defense - and a reputation and power built upon both
                of these
                circumstances for the state. I also find it possible to achieve this desired state in any nation where
                the presence of
                large estates might obstruct it, through a dissolution of these estates, without loss for the owners of
                such estates,
                neither in terms of power and honor, nor income or future security - but not through mandates and
                coercion - in general,
                only gradually, little by little. Therefore, I would advise the sovereign himself, owning rural
                properties in such a
                state, in his capacity as 'landlord,' to pave the way for a written regulation on serfdom (through his
                recommendation
                thereof), and in his capacity as estate owner for his rural properties himself to set an example."
                <br><br>
                "The population," he further states, "must begin with the rural population, which constitutes
                three-quarters of the
                Danish nation. The peasant has a remarkable inclination to bring children into the world who can assist
                him in
                cultivating the land. Colonies rarely thrive and succeed, and factory industries will only replace the
                plow - (and not
                easily arise) - before the country offers them its surplus, idle hands. Serfdom is harmful and destroys
                the peasant
                without benefiting the lord very much. The loss of time is always quite considerable with serfdom, and
                it is terrible
                where serfdom is excessive and arbitrarily imposed. Entire days are deemed worthless, and the peasant
                becomes accustomed
                to considering them as such. He is used for many things that do not concern agriculture. Hundreds of
                things happen at
                inconvenient times, and the peasant, who must always be available, is often drawn away from work on his
                own fields on
                days when it is particularly important for him to tend to them. Nor is the same amount of work ever
                performed in the
                same amount of time with serfdom as could be accomplished by those same hands, when inspired by the
                inclination that
                freedom and self-interest provide. The present agriculture is contrary to the development of the
                population itself, as
                it is based on the principle that as much land as possible should be cultivated with the fewest possible
                hands. The
                village community makes only half the country into a wasteland."
                <br><br>
                He repeatedly expresses himself with zeal against the state relying on a standing army, which is always
                recruited and
                which in case of need will often be insufficient and - at least with regard to its common soldiers -
                unreliable.
                <br><br>
                "Why should the state not rather arm its citizens, who can sustain themselves in peacetime and only in
                war become a
                burden to the state? Why not consider an institution where they become as skilled in defending their
                fatherland as they
                are reliable in terms of their will and loyalty?"
                <br><br>
                Finally, he further elaborates on his proposal to increase prosperity. The landowner should, thus he
                advises, himself
                maintain a reasonable portion of land and forest - the rest he should lease out to voluntary cultivators
                for a ground
                rent (land tax) and divide into reasonable plots that a farm laborer could manage. For citizens,
                laborers, and others
                who voluntarily offer themselves, the lord could then find an opportunity to assign them a piece of
                land, and since he
                received no purchase price, he should have full security for this. With regard to the land tax, the
                prince should exempt
                the landowner and keep to the new peasant. He should then set an example on his own Crown Lands; he
                could, according to
                his powers, forbid arbitrary serfdom and determine the extent of serfdom.
                <br><br>
                The tax should then be paid in the form of the country's fruit and not in money, as otherwise, in the
                course of a few
                hundred years, it would not be of any importance.
                <br><br>
                This is the outline of an essay that, with its clear, firm gaze at the whole, simultaneously reveals its
                author's
                extraordinary factual mastery and modesty.

                    <br><br>

                    The "Reflection" was originally not intended for printing, but Oeder's reasonable expectation
                    (according
                    to Moltke's
                    initial statement) was that he himself would present the manuscript to the king (which admittedly
                    differed from the
                    later printed text). However, the "Reflection" had not entirely turned out as Moltke had wished. The
                    minister withdrew,
                    and Oeder was offered 100 ducats as a gift for his trouble. He felt that this would lead him - not
                    only
                    graciously to
                    decline the gift - but also to now publish the document. In the year 1769, he had it printed, albeit
                    anonymously, and
                    dedicated it to the king. (Published in Frankfurt and Leipzig 1769 CE.)

                <br><br>
                In Germany, where these ideas were already known, the document was received with deserved acclaim. In
                Denmark, it caused
                a great stir and was translated into the Danish language. (The translator was Berthold Joh. Lodde,
                publication year 1769
                CE.)
                <br><br>
                The large landowners were highly dissatisfied. They believed they had a significant interest in
                maintaining serfdom.
                Their peasants, so to speak, were their servitude and belonged to the state only through them. They
                believed that the
                abolition of serfdom would dissolve this bond; all sovereignty over the peasants would immediately pass
                to the
                government, consequently, the structure of agriculture and thus their great influence in governmental
                affairs would lose
                its strongest support. Now serfdom was praised as the noble's greatest treasure, and it was reiterated
                that its
                abolition intended nothing but to suppress the nobility and thus the current state of affairs in the
                countryside.
                <br><br>
                Officially, a different tone was adopted. It was hoped that the abolition of the relationship between
                landowners and
                peasants would be made into an act of defiance against sovereignty.
                <br><br>
                "The author of the Reflection," it was said, "will concede a freedom that cannot even be conceived in
                the freest states.
                Only the terms for county, barony, and manor (according to the author's proposal) must cease - then we
                will be
                completely republican."
                <br><br>
                This prompted Oeder to write the "Supplement to the Reflection" in 1770, which was subsequently printed
                in 1771, and
                adorned with the glorious inscription from Pliny: "Verum fatentibus latifundia perdidere Italiam, jam
                vero et
                provincias." To confess the truth, large estates have ruined Italy, and now the provinces are no better
                off).

                <br><br>
                Oeder considered this supplement, as he has stated several times, his best work. Indeed, this little
                book contained - in
                addition to many more precise definitions of earlier statements - a closer application of thoughts for
                Denmark and a
                refutation of some of the objections raised against him.
                <br><br>
                "It is unreasonable," he says, "to cite the poor economy, stupidity, stubbornness, and disobedience of
                the peasants as a
                reason to maintain serfdom. It is unjust when the consequences of oppression are blamed on the
                oppressed."
                <br><br>
                Among other things, he turned his gaze towards the other European states and demonstrated that Britain
                could best serve
                as a model for Denmark and the duchies due to the similar maritime location, similar nature of the land
                with a slight
                difference in climate, and similar socio-economic foundation based on agriculture and cattle breeding.
                <br><br>
                "Without serfdom and without manors, England is in a flourishing state. It has a respected and wealthy
                nobility that
                lives in splendor and enjoyment from their estates. All this is known to each of us, and yet it is
                incessantly asked:
                What will become of the nobility when the manors are abolished?" etc. (Note: Review in a Hamburg journal
                1771: "The
                critique contains excellent remarks and must stem from a very knowledgeable man. (I wrote this because I
                considered
                court physician Hensler to be the author.))

                However, enough about this topic. I will now turn to another task that Oeder was assigned at the
                beginning of the year
                1770. On August 15, 1769, a general census took place in all the royal states of Europe. The lists
                obtained thereby were
                handed over to Oeder by the Rentekammeret (Revenue Chamber) on April 18, 1770, according to royal
                command, so that he
                could extract the results from these lists, make observations on them, and present a plan for organizing
                future
                censuses. The processing of the lists was so laborious, and Oeder soon became involved in so many other
                activities, that
                he could only present the results to the Rentekammeret in the year 1772. Since this report, equally
                important for Danish
                statistics and political arithmetic, has now been printed in Heinze's "Samlung zur Geschichte und
                Staatswissenschaft"
                (Collection of History and Political Science), Göttingen 1789, the public can also admire the man's
                sense of numbers and
                his astonishing diligence.
                <br><br>
                Some of the more significant results are as follows:

                    de dupe' (a fool's game), where there is no proportion between the players' significant risk and the
                    slight probability
                    of winning for them, and it is the instigator of this great widespread evil that so many ordinary
                    people are led astray
                    from rightful paths and means of earning a living, drawn away from diligence and frugality, and

                    "The Dissolution of the Botanical Institute"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even before the year 1770 came to a close, Oeder was relieved of his botanical work due to the
                    dissolution of the
                    botanical institute. As early as the last years of Frederik V's reign, there was a plan to transfer
                    the institute to the
                    university, with an annual subsidy of 3000 daler from the king's private funds. However, deep-seated
                    resentment was
                    strong enough for the university to reject this royal gift. Instead, efforts were made to establish
                    a new botanical
                    garden within the university itself, despite the lack of space and internal resources to execute the
                    plan. By 1770,
                    there was a proposal to the king for support of this new university institute. Meanwhile, Oeder's
                    institute had
                    progressed to the point where the smaller of its two parts, bisected by a road (at the outer end of
                    Amaliegade), was
                    fully landscaped and planted. The larger part, closer to Toldboden, required substantial filling and
                    planting, which was
                    also underway.
                    <br><br>

                At that time, plans were being made to develop a trading depot in Copenhagen, necessitating
                warehouses near Toldboden.
                As a result, the larger portion of the botanical garden was considered for this purpose. The
                university insisted on
                having an entirely new garden and repeatedly declined offers to merge the existing institute in its
                current form.
                However, they agreed to accept the smaller, fully furnished garden along with a modest annual sum of
                300 daler. The
                royal treasury thus saved an expense, and commerce gained a location for storage buildings.

                Oeder lamented that they were allowing an institute, which he rightfully considered his own, to fall
                and thereby bury
                him under the ruins of collapsed walls. In response, he was assured that he would be assigned to
                other duties.
                <br><br>
                By a royal resolution on June 9, 1770, the botanical institute was dissolved. Regarding Oeder, it
                was stipulated:
                <br><br>
                - That he, who had managed the institute with distinction to the satisfaction of His Majesty, and
                whom His Majesty had
                designated for other purposes, should remain in royal service and primarily engage in the "Flora
                Danica" project,
                retaining his salary as before.

                    contained cattle immediately after vaccination until the effects were observed; in the same area,
                    there
                    were cattle that
                    had been confirmed cured. The third enclosure was for sick cattle, housed in twenty board huts, each
                    containing two
                    animals.

                </aside>
                <br><br>
                The vaccination followed the method devised by Camper, and a detailed description can be found in "The
                History of
                Vaccination" by Royal Court Physician Rode and in Oeder's own account, published in MUSEUM.
                <br><br>
                The first experiment, conducted at the optimal time of year, succeeded with ten out of twelve cattle
                being cured.
                However, the subsequent seven experiments, particularly those performed later in the year, were less
                successful. In one
                instance, two out of six cattle were retained; another time, only one out of seven; and once, none out
                of eight. Oeder
                attributed much of this failure to the advancing season, advising the continuation of experiments for
                valid reasons,
                despite his reservations about the reliability of vaccination.
                <br><br>
                Indeed, experiments continued in 1771 and 1772, and according to Rode's information in 1772, only one
                out of 160
                vaccinated cattle failed.
                <br><br>
                While Oeder was on Avnø, the major ministerial changes decided upon in Traventhal were implemented in
                Copenhagen.
                <br><br>
                Oeder's keen intellect, business acumen, tireless diligence, distance from intrigue, and integrity were
                all qualities
                that had endeared him to the old government.
                <br><br>
                The new government deserves credit for recognizing these rare merits as well. Without his knowledge,
                Oeder had been
                placed on the list in Traventhal outlining individuals who should be preferably employed.
                <br><br>
                In a memorandum to the king, Oeder expressed the view that although at the age of 43 he was still young
                enough to embark
                on a new path in life, it was also high time for him to know the government's intentions regarding his
                future tasks and
                roles.

                    Bernstorff proposed that Oeder should become a member of the General-Landvæsenskollegiet, and he
                    secured a royal
                    resolution appointing Oeder as a commissioner in the collegium.
                    <br><br>
                    Bernstorff himself, along with Moltke and Konferensråd Schumacher in his capacity as the
                    Gehejmekabinetssekretær,
                    informed Oeder of this development. While awaiting further news on Avnø, Oeder briefly returned to
                    Copenhagen in
                    October, coincidentally on the day Bernstorff left the city. From Bernstorff and Schumacher, he
                    learned that the royal
                    resolution for his appointment to the General-Landvæsenskollegiet had been presented to the king for
                    signature twice
                    already in Traventhal, but the king had deferred signing, stating "there will always be time for
                    that when we return to
                    Denmark."
                    <br><br>
                    With this somewhat ambiguous consolation, Oeder returned to his cows in the countryside, continuing
                    his work until
                    November 12, feeling disheartened and concerned about his future.
                    <br><br>
                    At this time, Oeder was unaware of Struensee. The old ministry had fallen, and no one remained
                    except Schumacher.

                By a circular dated October 16, 1770, the king had invited a considerable number of businessmen from
                Therefore, on November 12, when Oeder returned to Copenhagen, he first turned to Schumacher. Upon
                entering Schumacher's
                office, he encountered one of his assistants who was just about to deliver a package intended for
                Oeder. It contained
                work from the cabinet.
                <br><br>
                all his
                realms—individuals who had all been recommended to him—to submit their thoughts on trade and
                commerce.
                <br><br>
                Schumacher, acting on the king's orders, sent these memoranda to Oeder, urging him not only to
                extract from them but
                also to accompany these extracts with his own remarks.
                <br><br>
                This task provided Oeder with both an opportunity and authorization to comment on almost all aspects
                of state
                administration.
                <br><br>
                "These my writings," says Oeder in a surviving manuscript, "these my writings, which the commission
                investigating
                Struensee's papers undoubtedly found and examined alongside others from my hand, I am certainly not
                ashamed of; and if
                the commission has given Struensee the opportunity to highlight me, then these writings could also
                have been useful to
                him, and thereby also to the State, insofar as any information directed to a man who holds power in
                his hands will also
                be useful for the state."

                    General-Landvæsenskommisionen - Establishment of Serfdom Service in Denmark 1771
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On November 19, 1770, Oeder was appointed to the General-Landvæsenskommisionen, which replaced the
                    General-Landvæsenskollegiet. He remained there until his entry into the Finanskollegiet.
                    <br><br>
                    "I have had the pleasure," he wrote, "to work in full agreement with five colleagues, including the
                    aforementioned
                    Schumacher. It is well known that I have not been idle, and the public has rather attributed to me a
                    larger share in
                    what happened than I can rightfully claim without disregarding my worthy colleagues.
                    <br><br>
                    The instruction approved by His Majesty for this commission originated from my hand, and I gladly
                    accept my modest share
                    of responsibility for the ordinance of February 20, 1771, regarding the establishment of serfdom
                    service in Denmark,
                    which may only appear offensive to those who know no limits to their ambition.
                    <br><br>
                    The work in the General-Landvæsenskommisionen and the comments on the merchants' memoranda brought
                    Oeder into closer
                    contact with Struensee, through whose hands all affairs were then beginning to flow. Until that
                    time, his acquaintance
                    with Struensee was only superficial, extending no further than matters of politeness and etiquette.
                    In fact, Oeder was
                    initially reserved towards a man who had governed the very ministry whose client he had been. It was
                    Schumacher who
                    instilled more confidence in him.

                    Appointment to Financial Council
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder found himself still in his previous role as a professor of botany. Members of the
                    Landvæsenskommisionen received
                    no payment. Oeder desired a final decision regarding his institute and approached Struensee
                    verbally. Struensee found
                    his request justified.
                    <br><br>
                    "A worker is worthy of his wages," he said, and by cabinet order dated January 5, 1771, Oeder was
                    appointed to the
                    Financial Council. His position was understood such that while he would continue his work on "Flora
                    Danica," his main
                    focus would shift to political economy and related tasks. His salary was set at 1200 rigsdaler, in
                    addition to the
                    honorarium for a secretary assigned to him.
                    <br><br>
                    In this capacity within the cabinet, Oeder remained until the end of May that year, a cabinet whose
                    seal Struensee soon
                    thereafter personally took over.

                <h2>
                    Oeder's View of Struensee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this period, Oeder worked closely with Struensee. At Struensee's request, he expressed his
                    opinions on many
                    matters. Often, he cautioned Struensee against hasty and excessive steps, and Struensee was more
                    lenient towards him
                    than towards many others, whom he had less reason to trust.
                    <br><br>
                    "This man," says Oeder in his manuscript, "this man whom the king had placed before me and many
                    others, so that I could
                    give him good advice to the best of my ability, which was my duty towards the king. This man who did
                    me no harm but only
                    good, I should not repay good with evil, but instead do my utmost to guard him against evil, that
                    was my duty towards
                    him. In general: there are those who find it difficult to reconcile that a person fundamentally does
                    not need to be evil
                    just because he fails in some areas (just as certain people possessing good qualities cannot always
                    be considered
                    completely good), therefore I say: let such moral guardians judge as they please. I, for one, can
                    testify in no other
                    way than that Struensee's behavior towards me has always been such that I do not regret my
                    acquaintance with him. He
                    certainly promoted me, but never did he expect anything from me that would contradict the duties of
                    an honest man.
                    Therefore, I have every reason to believe that, with regard to me, he viewed nothing other than his
                    conviction of my
                    usefulness. Hence, I can only lament for the unfortunate man that he has embarked on a path of vice
                    that has led him to
                    ruin."
                    <br><br>
                    From the outset, Oeder's intention was never to let his acquaintance with Struensee go beyond the
                    boundaries of work,
                    never to allow any familiarity to develop. This resolution remained true to him.

                    One of Oeder's most significant tasks was to develop a plan for a general widow's fund.

                    it in what I have contributed here. Undoubtedly, I am the first to have shed light on this area in
                    Denmark, despite
                    various attempts at widow's funds in the past. I have uncovered the errors committed in the military
                    widow's fund
                    established in 1739 – unappreciated by the Generalitet and Commissariat College, who, in 1771 at
                    least, completely
                    lacked insight into this matter – and I have demonstrated that the king, who was made the guarantor
                    of the flawed
                    institution, faced a loss of eleven barrels of gold with the already assumed obligations, and that
                    continuing the
                    institution on the same basis would lead to boundless risk.

                    In my quest to
                    thoroughly investigate the matter, I have worked on many related subjects to the exhaustion of body
                    and soul – without
                    ever receiving thanks for it.

                <p>
                    "On that same morning," writes Oeder, "when this cabinet order to establish this college was issued,
                    I can, by God,
                    attest that I had spoken with Struensee, but I had no prior knowledge of Count von Holstein's public
                    announcement of
                    this order to establish the college - I did not know that I myself would be a member thereof -
                    neither who the other
                    members would be, nor about the salary or placement."
                    <br><br>
                    When all is said and done, it is simultaneously true that the idea of this college, the separation
                    of the finance and
                    commerce colleges, the division of the old chamber into three chambers, the retention of their
                    mutual connection and
                    coherence with the finance college through a deputy leader of each chamber, all stem from me - but
                    not the connection
                    between the oversight of business life (which belongs to an Economic College) and the management of
                    the state's income -
                    nor the relocation from the chancelleries to the finance college of the many police tasks, through
                    which this college,
                    to my great sorrow, became overwhelmed with the collection of duties.
                    <br><br>
                    At the same time as I expressed my thoughts to Struensee, I assumed that I myself would remain in
                    contact with the
                    cabinet and would not enter further into connection with finances than was necessary above all for
                    my being able to
                    procure the knowledge and data, which were necessary for me in my work for the cabinet - these, I
                    should be able to
                    obtain at the source.

                The king himself, I continue, had suggested the three deputies from the finance college, who each in
                turn would be named
                as head of the three new chambers, that they themselves should recommend, with which people the
                positions in the
                chambers would be filled. I was a little frightened over this, over the power, which was entrusted
                to my hands, and I
                initiated the management of my office with a sleepless night, upon which several similar ones were
                to follow, and the
                coming period contained only a few happy moments and especially many worried; but I also recall that
                it concerned only
                the circumstances in the finance college and regarding financial matters, not the hours that were
                spent in the Norwegian
                chamber, for there have I, like in the General-Country Committee, as I with entry into the finance
                college needed to
                abandon, worked with great pleasure.
                <br><br>
                It is, God be praised, succeeded for me to occupy this chamber with worthy men, without having
                oppressed anyone, and to
                work in exemplary unanimity with these valuable coworkers, so that I at my departure have been able
                to take the
                satisfaction with me that I have left a well-set up, with the Norwegian nation hold and with the
                Copenhagen public well
                appreciable college, and also for my own to have acquired the respect, that I have led this
                important department without
                blame and with decorum.

                    Struensee's Fall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    January 17, 1772 marked the remarkable day that brought ruin to Struensee and many of his supporters
                    (the word
                    "Anhänger" here should perhaps be translated more as "associates" or "followers").
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder, who knew nothing about Struensee's arrest the previous night, arrived in the morning with
                    case files at
                    Struensee's residence, only to learn with shock from the guards what had transpired.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the realization that he had served the state and not Struensee soon reassured him. In fact,
                    Oeder initially
                    remained in his position as an untainted figure, whose patriotism and loyalty were guaranteed by
                    public acclaim.
                    <br><br>
                    An Investigative Commission was established regarding the changes in the Civil Service since
                    September 15, 1770.
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder boldly declared that the structure of the Finance College largely originated from him, citing
                    the reasons that had
                    motivated him to do so.

                    "One can reject my plan," he writes, "but I allow no one to look down upon it. Let the critics be
                    well-grounded
                    economists, and let them present to me knowledge attainable through routine; still, I will say:
                    'Anche io sono pittore'
                    (I too am a painter. O.A.); and I undertake to be accountable for my plan, whether to master or
                    apprentice. I must make
                    a special note that for a long time, no step had been taken that suited the Norwegian nation better
                    than the
                    establishment of a special chamber for the treatment of this country's socio-economic conditions
                    (which are naturally as
                    different from the socio-economics of the other royal states as the entire economy of this country
                    is). It also created
                    satisfaction that this chamber was primarily filled with Norwegians.
                    <br><br>
                    Often and long enough, Norwegians have complained that Norway, which is voluntarily united with
                    Denmark, is treated as a
                    lowly province. Representatives from Norway are seldom utilized in the chamber, and not always based
                    on the best
                    selection."

                    However, his reasons no longer applied. The Financial College was to be restored to its former

                    Initially, he was appointed to the esteemed position of governor (stiftamtmand) in Bergen, with an
                    annual salary of 1500
                    dalers. However, he had personal reasons that led him to decline this position. By royal appointment
                    on July 13, 1772,
                    he was subsequently appointed as governor in Trondheim with the same salary, plus an additional 500
                    dalers for travel
                    and settlement.
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder was completely satisfied with this decision, even though he could not understand why he was
                    removed just before
                    the important implementation of the widow's pension scheme was to take place.

                    He requested and received permission for a trip to Germany before the transfer.
                    <br><br>
                    The reason for this journey was his wife's illness. She was the daughter of Councilor Ericius (from
                    Schleswig), and they
                    had been married since 1755. (The journey went to Bad Rheburg. O.A.)

                When he returned from his trip to Bad Rheburg in October 1772, crossing the Elbe, he read in an Altona
                newspaper that
                someone else had been appointed as governor of Trondheim instead of him. One can imagine the honest
                man's distress, as
                his absence had been exploited by his adversaries to remove him. Even these enemies feared his return to
                Copenhagen and
                therefore managed to obtain a summons against him, requiring him to stay in Schleswig or Holstein until
                further notice
                regarding another position.
                <br><br>
                However, Oeder, trusting in the justice of his cause, did not let himself be deterred. He hastened
                directly to
                Copenhagen and lodged a complaint in a private audience with Dowager Queen Juliana Marie about the
                unworthy manner in
                which, in his absence and without any justification, they had stripped him of his position and slandered
                him before the
                world. They excused themselves by claiming that circumstances had necessitated a change in the
                governorship of
                Trondheim, as rumors of military movements in Sweden had made it necessary to appoint a military person
                in that border
                region.

                During all of this turmoil, Oeder, through his brother who was a chamber councilor and court
                councilor
                in Brunswick,
                reached out to Duke Ferdinand, who was the brother of the Dowager Queen Juliana Marie, seeking his
                recommendation and
                support. To make the injustice done to him evident, he presented the duke with a memorandum
                detailing
                the sequence of
                events that had led him from botany to state affairs. The duke forwarded this memorandum to

                recommendation had a favorable effect for the aggrieved Oeder. However, it also had an opposite
                effect
                among those who
                opposed the path Oeder had taken to bring the matter to the right place, which was as unexpected as

                governorship position in
                Holstein, equivalent to the Trondheim position. With this assurance, Oeder left Copenhagen in June 1773.
                <br><br>
                However, his removal from the capital alone was not enough for his enemies. A man as active as Oeder,
                who always had the
                courage to hold his head high, was a dangerous man to them, no matter where he was in the realm. What

                for better than the upcoming exchange of territories with the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst?

                    District magistrate in Oldenburg
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end of the year 1773, Oeder was appointed as the landfoged (district magistrate) in
                    Oldenburg. Although this
                    position as landfoged was considered equivalent to the promised governorship in Holstein in terms of
                    income—since the
                    landfoged position in Oldenburg yielded about 2000 daler annually—the prestige of the position was
                    not comparable.
                    <br><br>
                    The present duchy (in 1793) has four "land courts," where civil cases are only decided in the first
                    instance, while
                    criminal cases are handled from accusation to conviction. Each court consists of a landfoged and one
                    or more assessors
                    and secretaries. The land court in Oldenburg was the only one without assessors. Therefore, the
                    landfoged in Oldenburg
                    was the sole judge responsible for judicial proceedings in the eight district courts under his
                    jurisdiction.

                <br><br>
                Oeder, who was not informed of all this, now wrote to Oldenburg to understand the responsibilities
                of such a landfoged
                position and whether he could manage it with the light of reason. His friend's response was that he
                must admit it would
                likely be necessary to supplement it with the "little lamp of justice" as prescribed.
                <br><br>
                In the meantime, surrounded by enemies who only sought to embitter his existence in Denmark, Oeder
                fled, weary of the
                struggle but reasonably confident in his genius, to the haven assigned to him.
                <br><br>
                Sturz, whom he had known in Copenhagen, arrived safely with him after the great shipwreck. He was
                appointed as a
                councillor to the government in Oldenburg. Thus, this city came to "own" two men, each capable of
                bringing honor to any
                country. They both received a reception here that their recognized merits justified.

                <p>
                    However, Oeder's situation upon his arrival in Oldenburg was, in many respects, lamentable. For
                    twenty years of his
                    life, botany and related sciences had been his main focus. With great effort, after reaching the age
                    of forty, he had
                    immersed himself completely in political economy, finance, and the political art of calculation. His
                    understanding of
                    diverse subjects had been refined, and his mind was filled with great, socially beneficial ideas.
                    Love for his
                    profession had animated him, and the prospect of being fully useful to the country where he had
                    devoted his best
                    efforts—the land that had become his second homeland for the remainder of his life—had been his
                    proud desire. Through
                    his efforts, peasant freedom had been prepared, the opening of the Norwegian-Icelandic trade had
                    been prepared, and
                    through his efforts, a new general widow's fund had been prepared. All this was accomplished, and
                    accomplished with his
                    assistance, his efforts, his vigilance—everything for the welfare of the state—it was his proud
                    reward, the only genuine

                reward that calls every diligent civil servant.
                Suddenly, the longstanding ties that bound him to Denmark were broken. He saw the consciousness of
                victory, the mocking
                attitude of his enemies, and he had to endure the offense of one of his most prominent opponents,
                whom his efforts for
                the peasants had displeased. Upon parting with ministerial-aristocratic impudence, he had said to
                his face: "- he has
                been a harmful man to Denmark!" (Sch.. R... - von Halems' discreet letters cover: Joachim Otto
                Schack-Rathlou, who in
                1788 left his prime minister post in anger when the corvee was lifted.)
                <br><br>
                He saw his projects neglected or carried out by others, and in his 46th year, he had to see himself
                - not only under
                another prince's rule but also move to an entirely different branch of science, where he had to be
                an apprentice again.
                <br><br>
                In addition to this, his wife's persistent illness; she had been left in Schleswig (probably the
                duchy, not the city of
                Schleswig, OA) and her hypochondria was steadily increasing. Every mail brought him new and
                disturbing reports about her
                condition.

                    was a young man of barely 22 years, who had just left legal studies and had merely cast an ordinary
                    glance at the Rhine
                    and across the Belt - I forgot as soon as I had heard. Uninitiated as I was in the secrets of
                    political science and the
                    political art of calculation, the rays of light that seeped into my soul perhaps only strengthened
                    the darkness of my
                    fundamental concepts. Even then, the serious Themis (the goddess of justice, OA) strongly occupied
                    my mind, and this
                    connected me even more strongly with Oeder.
                    <br><br>
                    He would often joke about his new position and his unfamiliarity with law. "I must count myself
                    lucky," he said with a
                    smile, "that they haven't made me a bishop!" His first words to me were, "Do they not have somewhere
                    a kind of 'legal
                    funnel' through which I can quickly gain knowledge of case files?"

                    Indeed, I did not have such a thing, but I advised him as best I could.

                    Visit to his wife in 1774
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 1774, when he was absent for several months to fetch his sick wife, I alone managed
                    the judiciary with
                    the lord's permission, and from the year 1775, I was appointed as an assessor upon application.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, I worked with him in full agreement for six years and rejoiced in the trust he placed in me.
                    <br><br>
                    He never wanted to become a jurist - and he never did. Even his choice of legal literature was
                    characteristic, as he
                    preferred buying and reading drafts of new legal books rather than works on existing law. His
                    natural,
                    exercise-sharpened sense of justice and injustice almost always allowed him to judge the cases
                    correctly. Occasionally,
                    I would add a little oil to "the lamp of established law" when it threatened to go out, but I did so
                    discreetly, so that
                    he still regarded the clear light as a result of the light of reason. And thus, as they say, we got
                    along excellently
                    with each other.
                    <br><br>
                    (Note: His wife did not return with Oeder to Oldenburg).

                    Memorandum for Later Historians
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Denmark and its affairs continued to weigh heavily on his mind. Among his papers, I find the
                    beginning of an essay that
                    he started in the year 1774 but never completed. It was intended to be a memorandum from his own
                    time for the use of
                    future historians.
                    <br><br>
                    He wanted to lay down the most important thoughts he had conceived for Denmark's welfare, and his
                    motto was a sentence
                    from Cicero:
                    <br><br>
                    "Bono viro non minori curae esse debet, qualis respublica post mortem futura, quam qualis sit, dum
                    vivit." (A good man
                    should be no less concerned about the state that will exist after his death, than about the state as
                    it exists while he
                    lives).
                    <br><br>
                    Although it remained at a sparse beginning, the following excerpt from it would hardly be unwelcome:
                    <br><br>
                    "The events during the reign of Christian VII crowded in such great number and so rapidly, partly
                    quite fleeting, yet
                    not without influence and consequences; by nature they were also so peculiar and unusual that
                    historians in a somewhat
                    distant future will have ample difficulty in not losing sight of these events, in arranging them
                    correctly, and
                    reporting them impartially. That this must happen is - first and foremost for Denmark - but also to
                    be desired for all
                    humanity.
                    <br><br>
                    For this period of governance is unusually instructive. For Denmark, it is both instructive and
                    important, because the
                    period - regardless of the consequences that may arise regarding the royal family - is a fermenting
                    time for the nation,
                    and attentive descendants will be able to trace many of its foundations to this era. For humanity,
                    the time will be
                    instructive - even if it should have no noticeable influence on world events - because it shows what
                    a weak government
                    and extravagant living entail."

                "In the time of Frederick V, thoughts began to turn towards improvements in agriculture. This good king,
                with the best
                heart ever to grace a throne, desired all that was good, and his two most trusted ministers, Bernstorff
                and Moltke,
                sought to glorify their lord's peace-loving reign and their own ministerial office by promoting the
                country's internal
                happiness through the spread of art and science, and by fostering the subjects' industrious spirit in
                all areas—an
                admirable intention that can excuse various, possibly mistaken measures."
                <br><br>
                "Bernstorff's mindset was of an unrestricted noble nature, and he sought the good in full measure. He
                could err in
                certain areas, but it was not self-interest that caused these errors."
                <br><br>
                "I could not absolve Moltke from such errors. And who could expect exemplary selflessness from a
                favorite who had the
                fortune to raise a large family? Furthermore, he was not accustomed to thinking in systematic and
                strategic terms, nor
                to acting with the decisive strength that marks one determined to carry out a well-considered plan
                despite objections
                and obstacles. On the contrary, Moltke was susceptible to later objections and impulses that arose when
                it came time for
                execution and action, and he was easily swayed from his plans. And how many objections, excuses, advice
                for and against
                was he not exposed to from property owners among the nobility, both within and outside the ministry,
                including
                suggestions from stewards and lessees who were in favor with the nobility, often far removed from their
                estates!"

                "Undoubtedly (for he was not evil, but perhaps weak), undoubtedly he meant well for the king and the
                country, surely
                also for the peasants as fellow human beings; and surely those who accused him of seeming to strive for
                the king's good
                intentions towards the peasantry, but in reality creating obstacles to these good intentions, both
                intentionally and
                craftily, not far from hypocrisy—this has at least been publicly disclosed in a writing containing
                anonymous letters,
                reportedly translated from English."
                <br><br>
                "But it is certain and true that Moltke was always, and not without anxiety, concerned that the zeal for
                the welfare of
                the peasantry would go too far, and that the improvement of their condition to too great an extent would
                come at the
                expense of the landowners. This fear arose from, or was supported by, the fact that as a busy courtier,
                he did not know
                the situation and conditions of the peasants from sources other than his stewards' and lessees'
                pretenses, which pointed
                out that various presumed friends and advocates of the peasantry partly demanded too much altogether,
                partly too much at
                once, without reasonable consideration of the country's situation, the circumstances of the time, and
                the harm of sudden
                changes. There was a lack of sufficient evaluation of the ministry's wavering opinions, as felt by the
                public—a
                evaluation that would have shown what the advancement of agriculture truly was, what the intention was,
                and which paths
                should be taken to achieve the goal."

                    In particular, the beginning of these memoirs is permeated with gratitude towards providence. "It
                    has led me to a place
                    where I was encouraged to implement my fundamental principles. It has granted me influence, albeit
                    for a short time. It
                    has allowed me to act at such a time and under such circumstances that even for the most upright
                    person might be
                    considered unacceptable, and it has graciously preserved my unblemished reputation, not only from
                    being involved in
                    reprehensible connections, but also from the consequences of storms that can strike even the most
                    innocent. Finally,
                    providence has completely freed me from resentment and enmity from those who hate me because of my
                    beliefs and way of
                    thinking, without my giving personal cause for it, - and it has provided me a sanctuary in peace and
                    tranquility under
                    the rule of another sovereign."
                    <br><br>
                    But at the same time, he was imbued with a sense that he was called to further benefit this
                    sanctuary in service to the
                    Danish realm, to which he had dedicated the best half of his life.

                In this conviction, he wrote to Prince Frederick's then-favorite, Guldberg, and offered his service
                in implementing the
                project regarding the widow's fund, which he had now first developed (and reworked) after a changed
                theory since 1773.
                <br><br>
                The minister replied to him in April 1774: "that the king did not feel moved to avail himself of the
                insights of an
                official who served a foreign prince for his own internal state affairs, and that the king believed
                it would be unfair
                to his own subjects, who were capable of both investigating and executing such a project, should it
                be found advisable

                In reality, in Copenhagen, they now convinced themselves of what in the years 1771, 1772, 1773 was
                not admitted without
                great and stubborn resistance to Oeder. The organization of the military widow's fund, which had
                existed since 1739 and
                had been expanded to include other estates, was now considered useless, and at the end of 1775, a
                new general widow's
                fund was established.

                    Establishment of Widow's Funds - in Germany
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder, filled with his new theory, now brought ideas in 1776 to a larger audience (in Museum 1776).
                    He analyzed the
                    widow's funds of Copenhagen, Calenberg, and Bremen. He admitted that it was a questionable
                    circumstance that the
                    institution of widow's funds was still too young to be judged based on experience. However, he
                    pointed out where his
                    theory diverged from others, wishing that every state with a population base of approximately
                    100,000 people would
                    establish its own institution, thereby preventing its residents from seeking refuge in foreign
                    institutions.
                    <br><br>
                    He soon had the pleasure of seeing his ideas put into practice, as Hamburg established a general
                    maintenance institution
                    based on his proposal.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, with the help of a few hundred randomly selected individuals from the total number, he
                    conducted a trial by
                    which he determined the adequacy of his previously used tables. He became convinced that the
                    contribution (premium)
                    previously considered sufficient for a pension was inadequate.
                    <br><br>
                    He openly published this discovery not only to the leaders of the Hamburg maintenance institution
                    but also to a broader
                    audience, and he now calculated other tables using a method described in Museum.
                    <br><br>
                    For Bremen's widow's fund, he also predicted its future ("horoscope"). People knowledgeable about
                    the matter agreed with
                    him and realized that, to prevent future widows from being deceived, pensions needed to be reduced
                    by 40 percent.
                    (Museum 1779).
                    <br><br>
                    The Oldenburg state government was wise enough to recognize Oeder's talent, which tirelessly sought
                    to expand beyond the
                    designated legal sphere and utilize it for the benefit of the state. Therefore, he was tasked with
                    proposing a plan for
                    a widow's fund for the Duchy of Oldenburg and the Bishopric of Lübeck. He executed this in
                    collaboration with the
                    Oldenburg Chamber Director, Chamberlain von Hendorf, who had demonstrated his expertise with a
                    report he had prepared on
                    Bremen's widow's fund. By the end of 1779, the "Fund for Widows and Orphans" was established, with
                    Oeder, Chamberlain
                    von Hendorf, and the then-mayor, Justice Councillor Arens, overseeing it. (Ordinance issued in
                    Eutin, November 1, 1779).
                    <br><br>
                    The tables attached to this ordinance were calculated using the method described in Museum in a
                    manner easily
                    understandable to all. They were based on Süssmilch's mortality table, and the interest rate was set
                    at two percent
                    semi-annually. The tables were designed for both capital and premium-based payments (i.e., premium
                    basis O.A.).
                    <br><br>
                    Each participant had the choice of using either payment method for the pension they desired, or
                    paying a certain portion
                    of the pension with a lump sum and the rest with premiums over time. The pension was calculated in
                    portions for every
                    ten rigsdalers of annual pension. A woman who earned the right to enjoy the pension would receive it
                    for life,
                    regardless of remarriage. However, the man acquiring ("drawing") the pension could decide that the
                    pension would benefit
                    the children he fathered with his wife if she remarried - but only as long as the mother was alive.
                    <br><br>
                    This is a point where this particular form differs from the usual procedure. The calculation cannot
                    be otherwise
                    provided that a wife who outlives her husband receives the pension for her remaining lifetime. If
                    the advantage of
                    taking the pension could be included in the calculation, then this advantage should benefit all
                    those insured and be
                    used for a general reduction in pension costs (capital/premium). According to Oeder, this is not
                    possible, and the
                    pension institution, which has had its members pay the full price, has no right to this advantage;
                    consequently, the
                    pension must be paid in full for the mother's lifetime or to the children of the acquirer.
                    <br><br>
                    The institution can be used by all subjects, albeit not by foreigners. The kingdom's officials,
                    however, are committed
                    to joining the arrangement in relation to their office’s remuneration; they have the freedom to
                    exceed the prescribed
                    pension amount, but the sum for the annual pension cannot exceed 500 rigsdalers.
                    <br><br>
                    The ruler, from whom no more widow's pensions can be expected, allocates the institution with 500
                    rigsdalers annually,
                    from which the administrative costs can be covered, which also benefits the employees as a reduction
                    in their workload,
                    which should be: every eighteenth pfennig (= approx. 5 1/2%).
                    <br><br>
                    The institution's capital should be invested by citizens in secure rural properties. The ruler
                    guarantees the
                    institution, and any financial misbehavior should be excluded. No participant should complain about
                    the cost when
                    considering - as far as an ordinary human understanding allows - what is the nature of such an
                    institution, and what it
                    can do with deceptive ideas of being able to buy significant benefits for little payment.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, after experiences based on deceased married couples in this country, investigations were
                    conducted and found that
                    widow's funds could not be driven more cheaply for people who are subject to the natural laws
                    identified by Süssmilch.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the spirit of an institution, which has now proven to be solid after an existence of
                    thirteen years.
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder has left a lasting memory not only in this country but also - as the first to shed light on
                    this important matter
                    - he has deserved the whole world.
                    <br><br>
                    But it is not the only memory he left in the Duchy of Oldenburg.

                Under Oeder's direction and oversight, a survey was conducted from 1782 to 1785 throughout the Duchy of
                Oldenburg,
                carried out by the loaned Royal Danish surveyor, Caspar Wessel.
                <br><br>
                Similar to the Danish survey, this measurement was based on connected trigonometric and astronomical
                observations. The
                survey extended not only across both banks and the mouth of the Weser River but also the chain of
                triangles was extended
                further in accordance with the neighboring governments' agreements, all the way to the land's end at
                Ritzebüttel, and
                from there along the Elbe River to Freiburg and Hammelwörder, and further to Glückstadt. Here, the
                Danish triangle chain
                joined hands with the Oldenburg territory. Places crucial for navigation, such as the mouths of the Elbe
                and Weser
                rivers—gateways to Germany—had their precise locations determined through this meticulous surveying
                effort.

                <p>
                    Oeder also had significant and far-reaching ideas in this field, as he did in botany.
                    <br><br>
                    "If," he remarked, "if this example given by our ruler, and in my opinion for the first time in
                    Germany, inspires
                    emulation, and if several chains of triangles are established extending from existing chains at
                    locations equipped with
                    well-equipped and well-serviced observatories — for example, from Berlin to Holsten in connection
                    with the Danish
                    triangulation system; from Göttingen to the Oldenburg border in connection with the Oldenburg
                    triangulation system; from
                    Göttingen to Mannheim, and so on — then a desire expressed by many eminent mathematicians would be
                    fulfilled, and the
                    best foundation laid for Germany's geography."
                    <br><br>
                    After the trigonometric network was laid out through Wessel's work, the surveyors' work for its
                    further completion
                    began, a task Oeder did not live to witness.
                    <br><br>
                    Given the difficulty of his plan in terms of scale, he sought to achieve it through "intensity". The
                    survey itself was
                    to be conducted in unprecedented detail, integrating land-economic considerations. Consequently, if
                    additional workers
                    had not been employed, the entire project would have taken many years to complete, during which time
                    changes might have
                    necessitated renewal of the effort.
                    <br><br>
                    Following Oeder's death, the plan has been somewhat restricted, but it still honors his initiative.
                    In a few years, we
                    will possess an excellent, beautiful map of the Duchy of Oldenburg and its boundaries, testament to
                    his vision.

                    The period of Peasant Emancipation in Denmark 1786-1788
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite his duties as a judge, Oeder's tireless energy never wavered from his concern for Denmark's
                    affairs, which
                    remained close to his heart until his final days.
                    <br><br>
                    It must have brought him immense joy when the topic of peasant freedom became prominent under the
                    auspices of the noble
                    Crown Prince, and when his principles, once scorned, now gained prominence. In accordance with these
                    principles, a
                    commission was established in Denmark to investigate the relations between landowners and peasants.
                    <br><br>
                    To contribute to a positive outcome as much as possible, he not only had his "Consideration" from
                    1769 reprinted with an
                    "Addendum," but he also supplemented the work with "Five Appendices," covering his observations on
                    the state of the
                    national militia in Denmark and a detailed examination of the existing relations between landowners
                    and peasants, which
                    were likely welcomed by the appointed commission.
                    <br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"><img id="img36" src="/img/ryberg.jpg">

                    <object id="bio36" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                However, the fact that there were still adversaries of the peasantry in Denmark was evident in a
                publication from 1786,
                where the author of the "Consideration" was unjustly attacked for his views—albeit on false and
                fabricated grounds. The
                public, however, rightly disregarded the slanderer even before a response was dignified with a
                reply. (Note: Oeder's
                "Appeal to the Danish Public" in the Neue Kieler Magazin. The pamphlet is also printed elsewhere. A
                minor dispute also
                occurred in 1781 with Professor Fabricius, who unfairly criticized Oeder in justifying the Danish
                naturalization law.
                See Oeder's "Criticism of Intrusiveness.")
                <br><br>
                The most significant vindication came with the commission's result, namely the Ordinance of June 20,
                1788.
                <br><br>
                Here, it was recognized that King Frederick IV's noble intentions to improve the condition of
                peasants had been
                misinterpreted, primarily due to the organization of the rural militia. The improved institution
                stated with confidence:
                "The provision binding peasants to the estate shall cease entirely on January 1, 1800."
                <br><br>
                (Note: The text reads: "Das Land, welches die Bauern an die Güter bindet, soll vom 1sten Januar des
                Jahres 1800 gänzlich
                aufhören." The word "Land" must be a misreading or misprint for "Band," meaning "bond" or "tie.")

                    Invitation to return to Denmark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If Oeder had been younger, he might have considered returning to Denmark under the current
                    auspicious prospects that
                    were extended to him at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this recognition of his merits and the acknowledgment of the injustices done to him
                    sweetened his final days—he
                    felt unwaveringly dedicated to the welfare of Denmark.
                    <br><br>
                    Not only did he comply with the wishes of those in the ministry by providing information and
                    explanations, but he also
                    continued his work through direct writings.
                    <br><br>
                    During this period, there was intense debate in Denmark about the new currency and banking measures
                    in Holstein. Here
                    too, Oeder was in his element, succinctly developing his ideas in various contributions on paper
                    money, banking,
                    currency, and coins, all aimed at these initiatives. He emphasized that the existence of a paper
                    banknote depended
                    entirely on the empirically confirmed conviction that each of its notes was as good as hard
                    currency: therefore,
                    everything relied on maintaining this delicate balance, influenced by public opinion.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, he was not a supporter of these new measures. However, he was the only critic who, in his
                    assessments, not only
                    tore down but also simultaneously built up—not only highlighted what, in his opinion, should not
                    happen, but also
                    suggested how the matter could have been approached differently.

                    Paper money, mint etc.

                <p>
                    The last treatise on paper money is also notable for its judgment on France.
                    <br><br>
                    "In recent times," he says, "a phenomenon of state appears before the eyes of the world, truly for
                    the second time in
                    the last century of that same state, which compulsively transforms over half of its national debt
                    into paper money,
                    issuing obligations on this debt without setting any definite time for their redemption, but all of
                    them are indefinite,
                    all of them are equally close to redemption - a state where paper money does not yet exist, where
                    people are not
                    accustomed to its use and circulation, but where this type of money is suddenly introduced, actually
                    forced upon the
                    recipients. Already in itself, this state's debt constitutes such an enormous mass that the
                    possibility of repayment is
                    difficult to comprehend; repayments must necessarily occur gradually, so that each part of the debt
                    is redeemed and paid
                    over time.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this state also possesses great resources, which, however, are difficult both to survey and
                    calculate. But
                    about the circulation of a quantity of obligations that may correspond to the entire sum of all gold
                    and silver existing
                    in the world, and all of which are equally close - or equally distant - from their redemption -
                    about such circulation I
                    cannot form any concept, and the idea of the confusion expected from it is, to say the least,
                    staggering to my
                    imagination.
                    <br><br>
                    For instance, I do not comprehend how metallic currency will be able to compete against such an
                    immense quantity of
                    paper money, how a state, assuming it can dispense with metallic currency for domestic use, can
                    conduct foreign trade
                    without metallic money. How can it manage its political relations with the outside world without
                    metallic money?
                    <br><br>
                    For it remains a truth, at least I cannot disentangle myself from the old-fashioned belief, that
                    only "real" money (and
                    what is deemed therefore in its wrath), only real money is the "nervus rerum gerendarum" (the sinew
                    of affairs): Aside
                    from other concerns, one must not overlook the very possible and highly worrisome interference of
                    counterfeit paper
                    money in the immense volume of paper claims, nor the cautionary principle "that which human hands
                    produce, human hands
                    can imitate."

                <p>
                    According to this true principle, it follows that a complete prevention of banknote counterfeiting
                    is impossible. The
                    utmost possible difficulty in imitation and counterfeiting is therefore the only goal that can be

                    Oeder also made this the subject of his active contemplation, and he found a remedy. Naturally, it
                    is only secure as
                    long as there is a secret held by the government. The papers concerning this matter, about which
                    Oeder was already
                    negotiating with some governments in the last years of his life, were sealed immediately after his
                    death, awaiting the

                    that they should not
                    be lost.
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder wrote the treatise on paper money on October 30, 1790, and it is the last thing he wrote for
                    the public on this
                    subject.

                <h2>
                    Oeder's illness and death
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder had been experiencing mild cases of gout for several years, which he dismissed as
                    insignificant. However, more
                    concerning were sudden spells of dizziness in his last year. Both afflictions converged against his
                    otherwise robust
                    constitution, and he succumbed after an illness lasting nearly six weeks, passing away on January
                    28, 1771.
                    <br><br>
                    Even during his illness, his mental faculties did not abandon him, and his thoughts on paper money,
                    which he delved into
                    while bedridden, preoccupied him deeply at that time.
                    <br><br>
                    He would have preferred to stay with his family, among whom he found great happiness. With Christian
                    devotion, he faced
                    his transformation, blessed his children fatherly, who surrounded him, and passed away.

                <h2>
                    On Marriage and Children
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder left behind a widow and three children, a daughter and two sons. His first wife, née Ericius,
                    died at the
                    beginning of 1776, and at the end of the same year, he married the eldest daughter of the late Royal
                    Danish Justice
                    Councilor Conrad Mattheissen in Altona. She survived him. This second marriage, which soon was
                    blessed with children,
                    became a source of purest domestic joys for him.
                    <br><br>
                    It is quite rare to find an example like his, being both a good husband and a good father,
                    especially considering he was
                    a man overwhelmed with work, a man for whom both reading and writing held great allure, and who—dare
                    I say—anxiously
                    cared for his reputation as a scholar. It was a beautiful sight to see him with his late-born
                    children on his lap, to
                    observe how he clung to them with tears of joy in his eyes and felt happiness because of them.
                    <br><br>
                    It was likely this love for his children that moved him to abandon his prejudices and, a few years
                    before his death,
                    acquire a patent of nobility, which he certainly did not need. More than this patent, the father's
                    merits will spur the
                    sons to imitation, and the state, surely without regard to the patent, will recognize these merits
                    through his sons.

                <h2>
                    Oeder's Person and Personality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oeder was a man of medium, almost small stature.
                    <br><br>
                    His gaze revealed the thinker. His entire physical demeanor expressed his rare intellectual drive.
                    The simple account of
                    his life characterizes his spiritual life.
                    <br><br>
                    Better and more truthfully than I can, he describes himself in his surviving manuscripts:
                    <br><br>
                    "From the beginning," he says, "I had an inclination towards political-economic considerations.
                    After some practice in
                    these matters, with a steadily increasing accumulation of knowledge and experience, with a
                    perception of calculations
                    and systems refined by mathematics and natural history, with much love for work, with a certain
                    talent, a certain degree
                    of patience, and a certain knack—if I may call it that—for untangling complicated matters, with the
                    ability to present
                    thoughts (strengthened through practice), with an unyielding love for truth and independence from
                    prejudices, I dare
                    attribute to myself a certain competence in finances and other areas of social economy."
                    <br><br>
                    He was born to initiate a matter he was interested in, to bring out a new aspect of it, to devise a
                    new plan and ensure
                    its implementation. In the execution itself, he could then suffice with moderate and guiding
                    collegial advice on the
                    matter, which would often be to its advantage.
                    <br><br>
                    The issue that occupied him filled his whole soul and did not let him rest until he saw it grow into
                    reality. This
                    mindset could certainly promote one-sidedness; everything would be swept along in the maelstrom of
                    this particular
                    matter; it excluded all thoughts that might be closer to others. But it is precisely such an
                    attitude that overcomes
                    obstacles which less engaged people would consider insurmountable.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this attitude did not make him insensitive to the joys of social life. He greatly enjoyed
                    humor and could be
                    extraordinarily jovial and cheerful.
                    If he was caught by a playful thought, he would nurture and repeat it with heartfelt pleasure.
                    Musäus' writings
                    delighted him particularly. Each new part of his folk tales brought him a new joy, until he reached
                    the part where the
                    mocker Musäus, because of a half-forgotten ghost story, called the late chamber councilor Oeder in
                    Braunschweig a
                    "spiritual seer."
                    Then Oeder's brotherly love awoke. He wrote to Musäus about it, and this kind man respected Oeder's
                    sensitivity because
                    of its origin. "I can neither defend nor excuse the offensive passage, which must have escaped me at
                    a moment when the
                    muse did not cast me a friendly glance," he wrote, "Now it depends on providing compensation for the
                    incurred guilt, as
                    far as I can." He offered a public retraction (palinode) in a public journal (Gothaer Zeitung) and
                    in a subsequent part
                    of the folk tales, which was done with Oeder's approval. Oeder thereby felt he had dispelled the
                    shadows over his
                    deceased brother, and his resentment towards Musäus turned into greater respect and love for him
                    because he had made
                    this sacrifice for him.
                    In friendship, they can now walk hand in hand in Elysium and smile over their dispute here on earth.
                    <br><br>
                    I will conclude this biography with Oeder's own words, which he used about himself in his continuous
                    memoirs:
                    <br><br>
                    "I can entertain the thought that for a man it must be the most pleasant and satisfying thing, when
                    one has felt the
                    value of life and existence: that one has not existed without benefit!"
                    <br><br>
                    There are probably only a few who, with the same truth as Oeder, could say such a thing about
                    themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    No, you have not lived in vain—you, who have gone to eternity! Your merits will shine still in
                    coming centuries, and
                    your late descendants will bless your memory.

                Der edelsten einer scheid.<br><br>

                Flora,<br>
                du, deren Kinder er sammelte in kalten Norden,<br>
                streuen Blumen auf's Grab<br>
                deines geweihten.<br><br>

                Du verkauntets den Redlichen<br>
                o Dania,<br>
                trugst noch die Wahrheit nicht,<br>
                der unabweilich er huldigte:<br>
                aber dein Landmand<br>
                segnet ewig die Asche des Mannes,<br>
                dessen eifernder Ruf<br>
                ihm Freyheit bereitet' und Eigenthum.<br><br>

                Dem Weisen<br>
                öffenete gern Oldenburg seine Arme,<br>
                und dem neuen Vaterland<br>
                lebt' er nicht umsonst.<br>
                Wittwen<br>
                später Zeiten<br>
                wenn ihr ungedrückt von Mangel<br>
                euer Leben lebet,<br>
                denkt, es war er,<br>
                der auf der Sterblichkeit ewigen Gesetzen<br>
                unerschütterlich euer Wohl baute.<br><br>

                Er starb,<br>
                das Muster ratloser Thätigkeit.<br>
                Nur Ein Gedank<br>
                füllte seine Seele<br>
                bis vollendet die That stand.<br>
                Heil dem Manne,<br>
                dem solchen Thaten<br>
                folgen in's ernste Gericht !<br><br>

                Schon hier begann sein Lohn,<br>
                der schönste,<br>
                den seine Liben<br>
                Gott aubewahrt:<br>
                Treuer Gattin Zärtlichkeit und innige Vaterfreude<br>
                war seiner Tage Abendroth.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                Friede dem Entschlafnen !"<br><br>

                Translation of Gerhard Anton von Halem's Poem:<br><br>
                At Oeder's Grave<br>
                January 28, 1791<br><br>

                Lament, all you noble ones!<br>
                The noblest has departed.<br><br>

                Flora,<br>
                you, whose children he gathered in the cold north,<br>
                strew flowers upon<br>
                the consecrated grave.<br><br>

                You turned your back on the righteous one,<br>
                oh Denmark,<br>
                could not endure the truth<br>
                which he unwaveringly proclaimed.<br>
                But your peasant<br>
                eternally blesses this man's ashes,<br>
                whose energetic demands<br>
                prepared him freedom and property.<br><br>

                For the wise one<br>
                Oldenburg opened its arms,<br>
                and for his new homeland<br>
                he did not live in vain.<br>
                Widows<br>
                in later times,<br>
                when you live your lives<br>
                without the pressure of debts,<br>
                remember that it was he,<br>
                who, on the eternal laws of mortality,<br>
                built your undisturbed well-being.<br><br>

                He died,<br>
                a model of restless activity<br>
                only one thought<br>
                filled his soul,<br>
                until the deed was accomplished:<br>
                Fortunate is the man<br>
                whom such deeds<br>
                follow on the way to the final judgment.<br><br>

                Already here his reward began,<br>
                the most beautiful<br>
                that God bestows<br>
                on his beloved:<br>
                A faithful wife's care and heartfelt paternal joy<br>
                were his life's twilight.<br><br>

                -<br><br>

                Peace be with the one who has fallen asleep!<br><br>

                v. H.
