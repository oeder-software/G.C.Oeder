                But who is the subject of this in a distant place, far from Denmark - and with such grand words?<br><br>

                In the grave rests Georg Christian Oeder - since January 1791.<br><br>

                Who was he, and why did he receive this commemoration?<br><br>

                There are people who, by posterity, will be remembered more for actions that lay outside their
                actual<br><br>
                field of work than
                for what they performed in their daily duties.<br><br>

                One of them was Oeder.<br><br>

                When we shortly celebrate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of serfdom in 1788, he will be one of
                those whose name
                will be mentioned with gratitude and honor.

                His life unfolded so interestingly that we can briefly outline the main aspects of his existence.
                <br><br>
                He was born on February 3, 1728 in Ansbach, approximately 150 km north of Munich, between Nuremberg and
                Rothenburg. His
                father was a rector at the Latin school, and he grew up in rural surroundings with his grandmother in
                Feuchtwangen until
                his father became a Protestant bishop and dean there, and the boy naturally returned to his parents'
                home.
                <br><br>
                Even today, Feuchtwangen is a typical "green" area; just outside the town's borders, fields, meadows,
                and small forests
                begin to shape the landscape. Surely this rural idyll and upbringing had significance for the boy's
                later interests.
                <br><br>
                His father educated his sons with the ambition that they could be accepted at the most "modern"
                university of the time,
                which was founded in Göttingen in 1737.
                <br><br>
                Georg Christian Oeder stayed there from 1746 to 1749. He initially studied medicine but expanded his
                studies under the
                European renowned Albrecht von Haller to also include botany, where pharmacology served as an
                intermediary. In addition,
                he absorbed knowledge of political science, statistics, and political finance.
                <br><br>
                In 1749, Oeder left Göttingen to practice as a physician in Schleswig.
                <br><br>
                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img3" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">
                    <br>

                </aside>
                What led him there?
                <br><br>
                Partly he had studied alongside other young people with connections to Schleswig, and there were also
                family connections
                between the Danish-Norwegian court and Hanover, where the university was then located. Thus, we find him
                in Schleswig as
                a practicing physician.
                <br><br>
                But there was another who "discovered" him there, namely the monarchy's new foreign minister
                (oversecretary in the
                German chancellery), Johan Hartvig Ernst Bernstorff.
                <br><br>
                Bernstorff wanted Denmark (like Sweden) to distinguish itself, for example, in botanical activities, and
                having learned
                enough about Oeder's studies, interests, and knowledge in this area, he called him to Copenhagen in 1751
                after meeting
                him in Schleswig.
                <br><br>
                Let's not overlook his trial dissertation at the University of Copenhagen, which did not go very well.
                He (as a
                foreigner) became a victim of student unrest and bread riots, which completely ruined the presentation.
                However, the
                king chose the path where Oeder was appointed royal professor, and a botanical institute came into being
                with Oeder as
                its leader - along with a botanical garden established outside Amalienborg, where now the outer end of
                Amaliegade
                approaches the Gefion Fountain - right by the old customs house.
                <br><br>
                Simultaneously with the establishment of this garden, Oeder first traveled around Europe to study how
                others had tackled
                the matter.
                <br><br>

                    The Relationship Between Plant Growth and Agriculture
                </h2>

                </aside>
                When traveling, as Oeder did, it is inevitable to gain a strong impression of how the population,
                especially the
                peasants, lived their lives.
                In his travel reports to his superiors, J.H.E. Bernstorff and A.G. Moltke, he gradually placed less
                emphasis on the
                botanical side, which the two statesmen presumably only had a superficial knowledge of; but Oeder knew
                that both were
                interested in the prosperity of the economy, in which agriculture naturally occupied a very important
                place.
                And since Oeder, as mentioned, had dabbled in political and actuarial science in Göttingen, he could
                relate his
                knowledge to what he saw with his own eyes in his reports and thus bring his superiors into more direct
                contact with
                reality.
                <br><br>
                At that time, the problems of agriculture in the kingdoms were characterized by two predominant
                elements; there were the
                farming methods and the population's steadfastness (due to the military conscription for the land
                militia).
                Oeder was personally opposed to a conscripted army, and he found it happiest if a country could defend
                itself with its
                own forces. He realized the harmful effects of serfdom and corvée labor on the peasant's willingness to
                work.
                Therefore, it suited him well when Count A.G. Moltke in 1769 asked him to put his thoughts into writing.
                He immediately
                set to work; but when he was to submit the result of his work, Moltke had changed his mind.
                Perhaps he was afraid that Oeder had gone too far; perhaps he was strongly influenced by his peers


                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img5" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">

                within the landed
                nobility, who were reluctant to see too many reforms. In any case, he offered Oeder a "gratuity" of 100
                thalers
                (equivalent to a month's salary) to let the matter rest.
                This attitude did not suit Oeder, and by the end of the year, the treatise had been published in
                German—originally in
                Frankfurt and Leipzig, with a Danish translation (by Barthold Joh. Lodde) in Copenhagen.
                <br><br>
                Admittedly, the treatise appeared anonymously at the time—later it was reprinted with the author's name.
                In any case, it attracted much attention.

                <h2> Consideration of the Question:
                    How Freedom and Property Could Be Secured for the Peasantry in the Lands Where They Lack Both.
                </h2> <br><br>
                The treatise comprises a total of 132 pages in octavo format, which was practical in many respects
                because it could be
                carried in a roomy pocket or bag.
                The title immediately indicates that the treatise is kept in general, neutral terms, as it speaks of
                "the lands"—and
                that could be anywhere.
                In the introduction, the author also mentions this and adds that he seeks to refrain from moral grounds
                and notions
                suggesting that the restriction of the peasant's freedom is the sole source of contemporary woes and
                that a noticeable
                elevation of virtues would immediately follow the expansion of freedom.
                As a basis for assessing the conditions, he introduces the possible states in eight degrees worth
                mentioning:

                1. Slavery, where the peasant and his family are serfs without the protection of the law.<br>
                2. Slavery, but under the protection and supervision of the law.<br>
                3. Lifetime lease with corvée labor—enough with personal freedom, but without written and legal
                determination of the
                extent of corvée.<br>
                4. Lifetime lease—with legal determination of corvée service.<br>
                5. Hereditary lease with determined corvée service.<br>
                6. Hereditary lease without corvée service—instead of rent.<br>
                7. Ownership of farms subject to conditional corvée services.<br>
                8. Ownership of farms subject to rent to the holder—without corvée—with full civil freedom—yet with a
                continued
                connection between the farm and the estate, with the farm remaining part of it.<br><br>

                Although the author is absolutely a supporter of the eighth and last form, the conditions of the time
                compel him to
                discuss the other solutions as stages on the way to the desirable.

                    The significance of population increase
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Georg Chr. Oeder's studies in political science and mathematics have led him to evaluate the
                    importance of population
                    growth, both in military and economic terms.
                    <br><br>
                    He explains that the segment of the population from which population growth can be expected is the
                    agricultural sector.
                    However, he points out that this can only happen if the conditions of this population group are
                    significantly improved.
                    <br><br>
                    The situation, however, is that estate owners do not wish to expand the farmers' fields at the
                    expense of the main
                    estate. On the contrary, they diminish the farmers' own cultivation opportunities to the best of
                    their ability, thereby
                    keeping natural population growth in check.
                    <br><br>
                    A thriving agriculture is a prerequisite for a flourishing urban economy, and with this
                    consideration, Oeder delves into
                    writing about the industrial development in society. He believes that an increase in the rural
                    population can not only
                    provide "hands" for more intensive agriculture but also supply increased labor for the growing
                    industry.
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned earlier, the matter also has military aspects, and already in this dissertation, Oeder
                    demonstrates his
                    preference for a national army over mercenary troops.
                    <br><br>
                    He expresses it as follows:
                    "The government that wishes to secure a reliable condition, not relying on the friendship and events
                    of the world, but
                    on the state's own forces, so that even though subjected to external influence, it need not fear
                    upheaval and downfall -
                    such a government must ensure that the condition of the peasant class aligns with this intention."
                    <br><br>
                    He adds that he writes in this manner "not only to please princes who engage in wars only for
                    defense"...
                    <br><br>
                    To these thoughts, he adds a plan for how a suitable military education can take place, emphasizing
                    how much safer it
                    would be to rely on people's defense of their homeland rather than a defense obtained merely through
                    money, where
                    concepts like loyalty and fidelity mean nothing.

                    On the subdivision of manor farms
                </h2>
                <p>


                    It is quite clear to Oeder that even a partial transfer of peasant land to those who cultivate
                    it will meet resistance
                    from the nobility and other estate owners, due to the deep-rooted tradition and property rights.
                    He seeks to argue his
                    standpoint based on a set of logical considerations aimed towards the welfare of the state and
                    society.
                    <br><br>
                    He also understands the estate owner who continually inhabits his farm - as his ancestors have
                    done - but points out
                    that it is becoming more common for the estate owner to reside on his manor for only a short
                    period each year, leaving
                    the management to stewards and tenants. The entire relationship loses its human content and
                    devolves into something
                    purely economic.
                    <br><br>
                    He sees the possibility for change in a reform of the taxation system, and he also believes that
                    a consideration of the
                    relationship over several generations will convince more owners of the practicality of dividing
                    the estate.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding the legal position of the peasant himself, he has much to say. He seeks, among other
                    things, to separate the
                    estate owner's economic rights from his control over the peasant's person. He does not dispute
                    the estate owner's
                    economic rights but also highlights how a practical transfer to the peasants would require the
                    development of insurance
                    institutions so that the peasant, in the event of, for example, a fire, does not find himself
                    completely destitute
                    because he owns nothing else but the farm and its furnishings, chattels, and crops (unlike the
                    estate owner, who often
                    possesses several other estates).
                    <br><br>
                    Any transition from one state to another is difficult; fortunately, the author can point to
                    areas where, for example, a
                    prince has shown the way by introducing significant changes to his crown estate.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the prerequisites for a fair division and just determination of taxes lies in a cadastre
                    and assessment of the
                    entire area - the estate, the region, the state. This way, taxes can also be levied in kind
                    rather than in money. It's
                    not enough to know the size of each individual land area; one must also understand its
                    fertility, its productivity
                    potential. To avoid the fluctuating nature of monetary systems, natural goods are suggested.
                    <br><br>
                    At the same time, Oeder warns against making frequent changes to the country's cadastre and
                    assessment. One must know
                    where one stands, and stability in these areas is of great importance to society.

                <h2>
                    Supplement to the Report
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As objections to the "Report" began to surface, Oeder commenced a manuscript in response. However,
                    he never progressed
                    beyond elaborating on the first 39 pages. Then, a change in his circumstances intervened, halting
                    his progress.
                    <br><br>
                    He expressed this in the preface to the "Supplement" (published in 1771, in German, 67 pages,
                    octavo). This work, too,
                    was anonymous, yet he assumed that several readers of the "Report" were aware of his identity and
                    circumstances.
                    <br><br>
                <aside class="asideleft"><a id="img7href" href=""><img id="img7" src="./img/ryberg.jpg"></a>
                    <br>
                    <object id="bio7" data=""></object>
                </aside>
                Certainly, he noted that many had read his work as thoroughly as the Devil reads the Bible. He felt
                compelled once more
                to clarify his fundamental viewpoints and his motivation for addressing the subject in the first
                place.
                <br><br>
                He also found it necessary (as an introduction for intellectual dwarfs) to discuss the differences
                that existed at that
                time between the kingdom and the duchies in various aspects of agriculture. He provided a historical
                account of the
                conscription of the rural militia in Denmark/Norway to illuminate his advocacy for something akin to
                "universal
                conscription."
                <br><br>
                Of particular interest in his second opus on this subject was the comparison between Danish and
                foreign conditions. He
                demonstrated how in 1660 in Britain, by parliamentary decision and law, compulsory labor services
                and any form of
                personal submission were abolished. A landowner typically divides his estate into larger and smaller
                farms, usually
                retaining one near his main residence for personal use, often more for grazing than for crop
                cultivation. The rest are
                leased out for a fixed term at an agreed price.
                <br><br>
                At the time Oeder wrote his "Supplement," English agriculture appeared to be flourishing, and the
                nobility themselves
                were esteemed and lived in splendor and joy on their estates. Furthermore, there was considerable
                agricultural export.
                <br><br>
                And thus arises the question of what will become of the nobility at home if the estates are
                subdivided.
                <br><br>
                In the "Supplement," Oeder also had another opportunity to emphasize the advantages of the
                management system described
                earlier in point 8, and he specified population figures for different regions of the realms.
                <br><br>
                "The quantity of food determines the size of the population," he quoted from contemporary economic
                theories. He also
                highlighted the possibilities for a productive division of existing compulsory labor farms and
                proposed guidelines for
                the scale in various provinces.
                <br><br>
                Oeder believed that the state itself did not necessarily need to invest heavily in economic
                development; legislation
                merely needed to steer development in the right direction.
                <br><br>
                To describe the relationship between rural and urban areas, he drew a vivid example from Røros in
                Norway.
                <br><br>
                Overall, Oeder's travels brought him close to the Norwegian population, allowing him to obtain many
                candid insights,
                which he depicted with great pleasure (and admiration) regarding the Norwegian peasant's
                contribution to his land.

                <h2>
                    The Effects of Oeder's Writings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is certain that Oeder's writings caused great sensation. The progressives found many of their own
                    thoughts expressed
                    in his account; but many large estate owners found them presumptuous.
                    <br><br>
                    Oeder's biographer, Gerhard Anton von Halem, writes:
                    <br>
                    "The large estate owners were dissatisfied. They believed they had a crucial interest in maintaining
                    serfdom. Their
                    peasants, so to speak, were their servitude and belonged to the state only through them. They
                    thought the abolition of
                    serfdom would sever this bond; all sovereignty over the peasants would immediately transfer to the
                    government,
                    consequently, the structure of agriculture and thereby their significant influence in governmental
                    affairs would lose
                    its strong support. Now serfdom was praised as the noble class's greatest treasure, and it was
                    reiterated that its
                    abolition aimed only to oppress the nobility and thus the current rural state.
                    <br><br>
                    Officially, a different tone was taken. They preferred the abolition of the relationship between
                    landowner and peasants
                    to be seen as an act of defiance against sovereignty.
                    <br><br>
                    'The author of the Report,' it was said, 'would grant the peasants a freedom that cannot even be
                    conceived in the freest
                    states. Only the titles of counties, baronies, and manors (according to the author's proposal) are
                    missing, and then we
                    will be completely republican.'"

                </aside>
                These last lines were found in a work titled "Considerations on the Improvement of Agriculture in
                Denmark, Written by a
                Patriot," published in Copenhagen in 1769.
                <br><br>
                Oeder's own response to this diatribe is as follows:
                <br>
                "I regret that such a polite man as the author of these 'Considerations' cannot refrain from an
                'argumentum ad
                invidiam.' The author of the 'Report'—that is, myself, O.A.—who has dared to dedicate his work to a
                sovereign monarch,
                according to your interpretation, gentlemen, harbors republican principles, and thus: 'Hic niger
                est!' - isn't that
                right? And you would gladly make investigations into the relationship between landowners and
                peasants a crime against
                sovereignty! Therefore, I had good reason to express a few words about hateful ideologies and
                despotism from the estate
                owners who fight for the pleasure of ruling over their fellow citizens and for their 'majesty's
                rights.' I cannot
                believe that this twist you have given to the matter will sit well with the crowned philanthropist,
                to whom we have both
                dedicated our writings.
                <br><br>
                Regarding your concern for the nobility, I refer to the example from England. And as for your
                understanding of freedom
                (§1), which you want to shape according to the nature of the government, I refer to my preceding
                remarks."
                <br><br>
                Oeder's staunchest opponent in 1769 was his contemporary Joachim Otto Schack-Rathlou (1728-1800),
                who four years later,
                when Oeder was forced away from Copenhagen to Oldenburg, remarked of him: "- he has been a harmful
                man for Denmark!"
                <br><br>
                At the time of this statement, Schack-Rathlou was at the height of his power. He vehemently opposed
                the emancipation of
                peasants, and the only commendation that can be made in this regard is that he fully adhered to his
                position when he
                resigned as prime minister after the abolition of serfdom in 1788, leaving Copenhagen to reside on
                his estates and never
                again participating in the country's public life.

                It is reasonably certain that Schack-Rathlou was the author of the aforementioned "Considerations."

                With the versatility that characterized Georg Christian Oeder, he engaged during these years, among
                other things, in the
                vaccination of cattle, initiating and leading a series of experiments at Aunø near Næstved. He put
                forward specific
                proposals for the reorganization of the military widow's fund, whose calculation basis was hopeless and
                would place
                completely unreasonable demands on the future. With his mathematical and actuarial knowledge, Oeder came
                up with a plan
                whose interest rate basis actually "held" in Danish life insurance companies right up until the 1970s.
                <br><br>
                Given the evidence of solid knowledge and understanding of socio-economic problems he had provided, it
                was hardly
                surprising that on January 5, 1771, he was appointed finance councilor, after having joined the General
                Land Commission
                in 1770 upon invitation. There, he also contributed to the issuance of the decree of February 20, 1771,
                on the

                "Establishment of Labor Services in Denmark," thereby having the opportunity to apply some of his
                theories in practice.
                <br><br>
                When Struensee was arrested and charged in January 1772, Oeder's opponents took the opportunity to push
                him into the
                background. However, he had done nothing to be blamed for, and his relationship with Struensee was
                purely official —
                correct, friendly, but impersonal. Therefore, he was placed in a political "backwater."
                <br><br>
                Already in June 1772, Oeder was appointed as the diocesan governor in Trondheim, after having declined
                the same office
                in Bergen. While Oeder was on a curative journey with his sick wife in Germany, the government changed
                its mind and
                relieved him of the office, which was given to an officer "for military reasons," it was said. When
                Oeder learned of
                this upon his return, he made representations to the dowager queen Juliane Marie and Crown Prince
                Frederick through his
                brother, who at that time was a court counselor to Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, who in turn was Juliane
                Marie's brother.


                Despite an order from the government to stay in Holstein, Oeder went to Copenhagen to present his case
                personally to the
                royal persons.
                <br><br>
                A governorship in Holstein had been promised to him; however, his appeal now turned the matter in
                another direction.
                Probably through the mediation of, among others, A. P. Bernstorff, Oeder was now offered the position of
                diocesan
                <aside class="asideright"><img id="img11" src="./img/ryberg.jpg">

                governor and bailiff in Oldenburg. The offer, however, had the convoluted background that they were
                immediately facing
                the separation of Oldenburg from the Danish-Norwegian monarchy. In negotiations with Russia, Oldenburg
                had been
                exchanged several years earlier for certain rights in Gottorp.
                <br><br>
                A. P. Bernstorff let Oeder understand that they could not go further at that time. Thus, Oeder's public
                service for
                Denmark-Norway ended, but certainly not his interest in the monarchies. His frail wife remained in the
                Schleswig-Holstein area, where she died three years later. He himself moved to Oldenburg to begin a new
                phase of his
                life at the age of 45.

                It was quite laughable that Oeder had been appointed as landvogt, considering he had never dealt
                with law. But for once,
                luck smiled upon him. The government of Oldenburg assigned a young jurist, Gerhard Anton von Halem,
                to his office, later
                promoting him to assessor. This proved beneficial and joyful for both.
                <br><br>
                Von Halem swiftly rose in his career due to his competence, while Oeder was able to engage in cases
                of greater interest
                where his knowledge could benefit his new homeland. The following years were among Oeder's best in
                many respects. He
                entered into a new marriage.
                <br><br>
                His ideas about widows' funds and savings led to the establishment of Germany's first savings bank,
                still located in the
                town square of Oldenburg. His interest in cadastral surveys and related matters led to the summoning
                of the Danish
                surveyor Casper Wessel, related to Joh. Herm. Wessel and also Tordenskjold. In the subsequent years,
                he conducted
                surveys and mapping of the Duchy of Oldenburg, introducing a cadastre system that served as a model
                for other German
                states.

                In his later years, Oeder also worked on issues related to paper money, drafting a plan and
                precautions against
                counterfeiting. However, he was not an unconditional advocate for its introduction; he likely would
                have been more
                interested in a "cashless" society.

                During this period, he republished both "Betænkning" and "Tillæg," this time openly under his own
                name. The works were
                published in Altona, on Danish soil. Meanwhile, the political winds had shifted in Denmark, and the
                timing for reissuing
                the works was likely well-chosen. The influential figures in Copenhagen found it appropriate to send
                drafts of
                legislation on the abolition of serfdom to be reviewed in Oldenburg by Oeder. Among the advocates of
                peasant
                emancipation, especially A. P. Bernstorff and Chr. D. Reventlow, Oeder was certainly considered one
                of their own.

                If he had wished to return to Denmark at that time, the path would likely have been open. But the
                opportunity had
                passed. His health was not the best, and he preferred to remain where he was. After a few weeks of
                illness, he passed
                away on January 28, 1791.
                <br><br>
                He was buried in the newly established cemetery outside the city, and his grave was adorned with the
                mentioned monument
                by the Danish sculptor Johannes Wiedewelt. A testament to the Danish government's gratitude is
                evident in the fact that
                after his death, his children were granted Danish citizenship alongside their inherited Oldenburg
                and Ansbach
                citizenship from their father's birthplace.

                    The Man Georg Christian Oeder
                </h2>

                Oeder was simultaneously outgoing and introverted. Where he believed it could benefit the common good
                and enlightenment,
                he was an exceedingly diligent writer. However, concerning himself and his personal affairs, he was
                reserved. Thus, he
                did not engage in writing any form of autobiography, and the letters left behind only touch on specific,
                factual matters
                that reveal little about the person Georg Christian Oeder.
                <br><br>
                Most of the essential information about him therefore comes from his collaborator in his later years,
                the jurist and
                poet Gerhard Anton von Halem. Von Halem was assigned as Oeder's legal advisor and mentor when he arrived
                in Oldenburg in
                1773. Von Halem himself had roots in Oldenburg. After Oeder's death in 1791, von Halem wrote the small
                book "Andenken an
                Oeder" (In Memory of Oeder), which was published in Altona in 1793. He dedicated this memoir to Oeder's
                widow.
                <br><br>
                Oeder was probably not an easy man to deal with, as tradition in his family suggests. Yet, he was a man
                of conviction.
                He possessed civil courage, as demonstrated when he refused to testify against Struensee, despite not
                holding the
                highest opinion of Struensee's moral character. Struensee had always treated Oeder with correctness and
                honesty, which
                Oeder believed should not be repaid with baseless gossip and slander.
                <br><br>
                Certainly, such an action would have damaged Oeder's standing among the lesser figures of the time. That
                it ended as
                well as it did was solely Oeder's own merit. Perhaps his temperament suited better with Duke Peter
                Friedrich Ludwig in
                Oldenburg, another young man who could appreciate Oeder's merits.
                <br><br>

                </aside>
                In 1788, a pamphlet titled "Authentic and Highly Remarkable Information on Counts Struensee and Brandt's
                History" was
                published in Kempten. For the first time, it was translated and printed from the French manuscript by a
                prominent
                anonymous author. The pamphlet is attributed to a small circle of individuals, including H.P. Sturz, who
                arrived in
                Oldenburg around the same time as Oeder, Landgrave Carl of Hesse, S.O. Falkenskjold, and Georg Christian
                Oeder himself.
                The anonymous author was believed to be the Landgrave, who was close to the Danish court. In its
                sobriety, the style
                remarkably resembles Oeder's own. The pamphlet seeks to provide a documentary account of the dramatic
                events in
                Copenhagen in January 1772. While not glorifying Struensee in any way, it does rehabilitate him
                regarding most of the
                charges he was convicted of. The portrayal of Queen Caroline Mathilde is delicate, almost chivalrous.
                One can easily
                imagine Oeder as the "editor" of this book.
                <br><br>
                Oeder experienced a reasonably happy family life only after 1776, when he married for the second time.
                Catharine Gertrud
                Mattiesen was the daughter of Conrad Mattiesen, a judicial councilor and councilman in Altona. She was
                21 years old when
                they married and outlived her husband until 1807. It speaks volumes about Oeder that he maintained an
                excellent
                relationship with his first wife's family, the Ericius lineage in Schleswig, until his death. His
                connections with his
                childhood region around Ansbach and Feuchtwangen were also kept alive, as evidenced by the church
                records in Oldenburg
                where several "homeland" family members acted as godparents at his children's baptisms.
                <br><br>
                In consideration of his children, he was ennobled in 1784 so that they could add "von" to their names.
                He himself
                probably viewed such titles with a smile, and his position in the scientific and political world
                certainly did not
                necessitate it.
                <br><br>
                Although he may have been a serious man in daily life, like many family fathers of his time, he must
                have had a
                reasonable sense of humor. He joked several times with von Halem about his appointment as landvogt,
                despite lacking any
                legal background. "They might as well have made me a bishop," he reportedly said. It must have brought
                him both joy and
                satisfaction that outstanding men like A.P. Bernstorff and Chr. Ditlew Reventlow honored him for his
                contribution to
                agricultural reforms in Denmark.

                    In a note from his last days to be quoted:

                    "Ich kann dem Gedanken Platz lassen, der einem Mann welcher den Werth des Lebens und des Daseyns
                    fühlt, vor allen der
                    angenehmste und befriedigendste ist: nicht ohne Nutzen in der Welt gewesen zu seyn."
                    "I can allow the thought to occupy a place which, for a man who feels the value of life and
                    existence, is above all the
                    most pleasant and satisfying: to have not been without benefit in the world.""- ikke at have været
                    ganske uden nytte til
                    i verden..."
                    <br><br>
                    "-to have not been without benefit in the world-"
                    Georg Christian Oeder could in 1791 depart from this world with peace of mind, conscious that he -
                    despite the foolish
                    remarks - had been a good servant and wise advisor to Denmark.
                    <br><br>
                    His name will live on - not only through Flore Danica - but also for his efforts on behalf of the
                    peasantry, when it was
                    truly needed.

                Johan Wiedewelt's gravestone monument over Georg Christian Oeder at the cemetery in Oldenburg bears on
                its front side
                the image of the cloudberry flower, the plant that initiates FLORE DANICA. Additionally, the names of
                Oeder and his wife
                can be read (though indistinctly). The entire backside of the monument was filled with a text, which
                today is
                practically illegible; fortunately, we know it from the author, Gerhard Anton Halem, who reproduced it
                in his memoir
                about Oeder. It reads in German:<br><br>
