                If I had nothing to rely on but the purity of my intentions in writing, I would name myself without
                hesitation, but
                caution forbids me from doing so, at least for now, for the sake of the matter and myself.
                <br><br>
                For the sake of the matter, to direct all attention that this writing may be worthy of away from the
                author and solely
                onto the arguments.
                For my own sake, because the question I dare to address is a truly contentious one and can all too
                easily give rise to
                hostile sentiments,
                <br><br>

                <br>
                which no one would willingly be the target of.
                <br><br>

                I therefore refrain from explicitly naming any particular country and address the question in much the
                same way as an
                arithmetic problem with symbols for indefinite quantities, where in each specific case, definite numbers
                can be
                substituted. Although I am aware that this approach risks making my presentation dry.
                <br><br>

                One must arm oneself with strict impartiality in order to navigate the contrast of opinions when
                discussing this
                question. On one side, there is the despotism of those landowners who defend their right to rule over
                their fellow
                citizens as if it were a royal prerogative; the anxious fears of others that the peasantry might gain at
                their expense;
                entrenched prejudices, as if no better system could exist than the one already in place. On the other
                side, there are
                unfair accusations against all landowners without distinction, as if their resistance were the sole
                reason hindering all
                progress; pious wishes without truly understanding where the fault lies or where help should be applied;
                and impatience
                that wants to force everything through and
                <br>
                7)
                <br>
                gives no time for plans to come to fruition.
                <br><br>
                I therefore deliberately refrain from invoking moral arguments and from the easily exaggerated notion
                that the
                restriction of the peasantry’s freedom is the sole source of all their vices, and that with the
                expansion of freedom, a
                significantly higher degree of virtue must necessarily follow.
                <br><br>
                The question is of the utmost importance, and the current and future fate of states depends on its
                resolution and the
                successful implementation of that resolution. States can be convulsively shaken and disrupted, or the
                path can be paved
                for an expanded prosperity.
                The question is also exceedingly complex and impacts all aspects of state administration. Population,
                industry, defense,
                and finance—all must be taken into consideration, each individually and all together as a whole.
                <br><br>

                To fully discuss the matter would require a book, but a book does not easily gain entry or a hearing in
                those places
                from which the promotion or hindrance of good must be expected.


                <br>
                8)
                <br>
                One must therefore be content to unite the main considerations under a common perspective. If one is
                fortunate enough to
                capture and hold the initial attention, and if the perspective is correctly chosen, the rest will
                gradually follow on
                its own.
                I want to outline the content of my thoughts first and then elaborate on the main points.

            </section>

            <section id="chap3">

                <h2>
                    Content.

                </h2>
                I am firmly of the opinion that the condition of a country where the farmer cultivates his own land is
                preferable to the
                condition where he works without ownership and with restricted freedom.
                <br><br>
                I therefore consider the best structure of land ownership in a state to be one in which the land is
                divided into
                portions that are not larger than what can be managed by their inhabitants without the need for forced
                labor; where each
                inhabitant of such a portion can regard and treat it as his own property; and where the rights of the
                higher classes to
                these portions are fixed in specific dues.
                <br><br>
                9)
                <br>
                The further the particular structure in any state deviates from this system, the less advantageous I
                consider it to be,
                or even harmful.
                From the above-mentioned structure arises an expanded population, and with this population all the
                fortunate
                consequences that come with it: the expansion of civil industries, a secure defense position, and the
                prestige and power
                of the state based on these two circumstances.
                I also believe it is possible to achieve this desired structure in any state where the existence of
                large estates stands
                in the way, through their division, without causing any loss to the owners of such estates—neither in
                terms of prestige,
                income, nor future security.
                <br><br>
                But not through command and coercive measures.
                Also, only gradually.
                I would therefore advise the ruler of such a state, who himself possesses domains, to pave the way as
                sovereign by
                mandating a written regulation of the forced labor; and as the lord of his domains, to set an example.

                <h2>
                    Further clarification of my opinion.
                </h2>
                I acknowledge different levels of preference for one structure over another, and it is not my intention
                to criticize
                each one equally. Such levels are: <br><br>
                1. Enslavement of the farmer and his family without specific protection from the law.<br><br>
                2. Enslavement, but with protection and closer supervision by the law.<br><br>
                3. The tenant status of the laboring farmer for life, with personal freedom, but still without written
                and judicial
                regulation of forced labor.<br><br>
                4. Tenant status for life, with judicial regulation of forced labor.<br><br>
                5. Hereditary tenancy with defined forced labor.<br><br>
                6. Hereditary tenancy without forced labor, in exchange for dues.<br><br>
                7. Proprietary ownership of the farm, in exchange for regulated forced labor.

                <br>

                11)<br>
                8. Proprietary ownership of the farm, in exchange for dues to the landlord, without forced labor, with
                complete civil
                freedom, while merely maintaining a connection between the farm and the estate, of which it remains a
                part.
                <br><br>
                This last stage is precisely the structure I advocate, and to which the preceding stages should
                gradually approach.
                There is surely no debate over the unacceptability of the first stage, and it would be an honor to
                humanity if this
                structure were never to exist anywhere. The second and third stages are the most common among the
                tolerable degrees of
                forced labor, though the second hardly deserves to be called tolerable. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and
                seventh stages are
                still uncommon and perhaps should be seen as nuances of gradual progress towards perfection in various
                countries,
                necessary according to the prevailing circumstances in each, and as steps that cannot be skipped. For I,
                as will become
                clearer, am entirely opposed to any violent and hasty measures, and I fully recognize the gap between
                the second stage
                and the eighth.

                <br>


                12)
                <br>
                Meanwhile, it is fitting for a government to have the best possible structure in mind as its goal, and
                where it has free
                rein, as a prince does with his domains, to shorten the path to that goal, thereby making its example
                all the more
                instructive and persuasive.
                <br><br>
                While acknowledging the gradation, I now assert the superiority of the eighth stage and believe that,
                with careful
                observation of the European states, one will find that their greater or lesser prosperity is determined
                by the condition
                of their peasantry, insofar as the prosperity of the state depends on agriculture.
                However, the prosperity of the state does not rest solely on agriculture but also on civil industry,
                trade, and
                manufacturing. Therefore, if a country with a less advantageous structure for its peasantry is
                nevertheless
                significantly populous because it possesses considerable manufacturing and trade, this does not disprove
                my point.
                Rather, there is still reason to assert that it would be even more populous if the structure of its
                peasantry were more
                advantageous, and that a country less fortunate in terms of industry should not rely on such an

                <br>
                13)
                <br>
                example and thereby neglect the possible improvement of its peasantry.
                <br>
                Furthermore, it goes without extensive explanation that when one speaks of the abolition of forced
                labor, one also
                implies the division of large manor farms and estates. This is because such large farms cannot be run
                without forced
                labor, relying solely on hired laborers who would be on the lord's constant payroll. A landlord would
                find this
                arrangement economically unviable.

                    Population.
                </h2>
                The most reliable source of a state's population is rightly found in the peasantry, who are engaged in
                producing food
                and all goods of basic necessity for themselves and for the other classes. In all states, even in those
                where other
                occupations, such as shipping, trade, and urban crafts, flourish at their peak, they are still the most
                numerous, and in
                most of the countries which are the subject of this consideration, they make up three-quarters of the
                nation, or even
                more.
                <br>

                14)
                <br>
                In this class, one of the purposes and motives for marriage, the mutuum adjutorium (mutual assistance),
                is particularly
                strong. For while the city dweller shuns the expense of married life and the growth of the family, the
                farmer finds in
                his wife, and even in his children once they are somewhat grown, helpers in his work and co-earners.
                Thus, one can rely
                on the fact that where there is room for a pair of married people, it will also be filled.
                <br><br>
                The increase in the human race and among animals progresses very quickly until a certain level is
                reached, which is
                determined by the supply of food. This can be seen in the rapid growth of European colonies in other
                parts of the world,
                in the repopulation of countries where war and plague have ravaged, and in the quick recovery of
                livestock numbers after
                cattle plague. Once this level is reached, the increase comes to a halt, and if it is to continue, a new
                source of food
                must be found. This occurs through the division of large estates and the abolition of feudal labor
                services.

                <br>
                15)
                <br>
                Firstly, the new farms that arise from the divided manorial lands provide many places for new families,
                which represents
                a considerable increase, especially when one considers that in most of the countries being discussed,
                the manorial land
                constitutes a quarter of the land.
                <br><br>
                Secondly, among the freed manorial farms, there are always many of considerable size and suitable for
                division, and
                daily experience teaches that diligent hands often nourish themselves better on a small, well-developed
                plot of land
                than others on large, less developed farms.
                And thirdly, on the occasion of the distribution of arable land, the areas that are not yet arable,
                which have remained
                uncultivated due to a lack of hands and the drive for strenuous labor, are gradually also being
                cultivated. For when two
                new families share the portion that was previously held by only one family, each finds their share not
                large enough, so
                they are driven to expand by cultivating the previously neglected plots lying at their doorstep. And
                because there are
                more hands, they can gradually accomplish this.

                <br>


                16)
                <br>
                In this way, if it is at all possible, an increase in the population from within occurs naturally, which
                can never be
                achieved through the influx of people from outside, through colonists, and which many states have often
                sought in vain
                at great expense. Colonists have their place only where there is a campus derelictus (abandoned land),

                the one who takes possession, entire stretches of good and bad land, where the colonists first seize the
                good land but
                leave the rest untouched. In lands that are already inhabited, albeit poorly inhabited, where the land
                has once been
                divided into large estates, and where the existing inhabitants are in possession of the good plots,
                there is nothing
                left to offer the colonists but exclusively poor land, which almost always is also claimed by the old
                inhabitants.schlechtem Lande, und über die physikalischen Hindernisse, bey dem Widerwillen und Hasse der

                Therefore, the colonists, facing only poor land, physical obstacles, and the resentment and hostility of
                the old
                inhabitants, cannot thrive without a continuous, costly contribution from the government, which will
                find that subjects,
                however valuable they may be in general, are too dearly bought at such a price.
                <br><br>
                This population growth within the peasantry is possible under the constitution that I advocate, and the
                future
                inhabitants of the state will inevitably emerge from the bosom of the old families if the places for
                their accommodation
                are prepared; however, it is impossible at all previous stages, even at the sixth and seventh, and in
                such countries,
                there is an eternal barrier against further population growth in the state, insofar as it is to come
                from the peasantry.
                Where should the places for new families to settle come from? The landowners will not increase the
                peasant land at the
                expense of the main estate and to the detriment of the manorial land, but there are plenty of examples
                of the opposite,
                despite princely prohibitions against this harmful practice, which is one of the direct paths to
                depopulation of a
                state. The division of the large compulsory or feudal farms also does not take place because they are
                not the property
                of their inhabitants. The landowners might consider it, but most of them do not live on their estates,

                <br>
                and even if they did, other obstacles would quickly dissuade them: more dwellings would have to be
                built; it is said
                that one prefers to have upright peasants rather than miserable servants on the estate. u. b. m. (ut

                How could there even be any encouragement to marry among people who have no property, whose entire
                situation is
                precarious and without a stable place?<br><br>
                The cultivation of still uncultivated areas must necessarily be abandoned where there are scarcely
                enough hands to work
                the land that has been plowable for centuries. Indeed, as much as such improvements in the state are to
                be desired,
                because every piece of cultivated land is a conquest, I do not know if, under such circumstances, one
                might have even
                more reason to wish for their omission, as they usually result in a new burden for the laboring peasant.

                <h2>
                    Relationship Between Agriculture and Civic Trade

                </h2>
                One can only separate the two types of trades, agriculture and civil trade, in thought and consider each
                individually,
                but in their operation, they are inseparable and should never be separated in the investigations and
                decisions of a
                government. The questions regarding the preference of one of these two main branches of trade over the
                other are thus
                very insignificant and become harmful when they lead to the favoring of one trade at the expense of the
                other. Just as
                one hand washes the other, so do people use each other: all trade is based on their mutual needs and
                expands with the
                number of people who use each other and with the diversity of their needs. The government has the
                oversight and it is
                its duty to remove all obstacles that arise from the restriction of freedom, but its direct intervention
                is rarely
                necessary, and where there is a lack of people who can see each other at work through their needs, it is
                ineffective.



                <br> 20)<br><br>

                Agriculture and civil trade thus have a parallel course in their rise and fall, which we must follow
                somewhat in our
                considerations to see how the population beginning in the farming class leads to a further population in
                the civil
                class, and is also favored by the expansion of this class itself; how these wheels engage with each
                other.
                <br><br>
                The soil is fertile to a high degree, which has only rarely been achieved in certain blessed areas in
                the past and
                present centuries, and it is certainly wiser to calmly leave its determination to the outcome rather
                than to undertake
                it prematurely. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that nature is as bountiful as people demand of it
                through diligence
                and intelligence. To demand requires an occasion, desires that can be satisfied, knowledge of many
                things that arouse
                desires, and a drive for well-being.<br><br>
                A drive for well-being, even among the farmer! To the chicken on his own table on Sunday, which the good
                French



                <br> 21)<br>
                king, Henry, wished for his farmers. Since so much is spoken and written about luxury, a few words on it
                may also find
                their place here. Well-being ceases to be permissible wherever the satisfaction of the drive for
                well-being involves
                neglecting a duty, but it only ceases to be well-being at that point, and until then, this drive is not
                only innocent
                but indispensable for encouraging diligence. However, the duties that the drive for well-being easily
                oversteps are
                usually not subjects of the law, and thus the boundary between permissible well-being and punishable
                well-being, or
                excess, lies within the domain of morality and outside the domain of governmental regulation, just as
                all human behavior
                in cases where the laws can neither determine nor should determine anything. A government risks, through
                accumulated
                prohibitions, uprooting the wheat along with the weeds, and individual prohibitions against this or that
                form of excess
                achieve nothing more than causing excess to manifest in other areas. However, a government has it within
                its power to
                remove the evil at its source by other means,



                <br> 22)<br>
                when it prevents wealth from taking the place of merit, maintains the distinction between the social
                classes, and
                withholds its sympathy from those who ruin themselves through excess.<br><br>
                Such a drive for well-being can only manifest among the free farmers; the unfree, who have no property,
                must forsake it
                and restrict themselves to the bare essentials. Under such a constitution of the farming class, there is
                little to earn
                for the rural towns, and they remain small and poor.
                <br><br>
                Let us assume in such a country the proportion of lord's land to farmers' land as 1 to 4, then the
                farming class, by the
                distribution of the lord's land into farm properties, gains an increase of one-fourth of their previous
                number through
                the inhabitants, and if this number was previously about one million, it can grow to 1,250,000. If we
                now in the same
                country calculate one city dweller for every three in the countryside, the new population growth in the
                farming class
                could lead to an increase of 180,000 people in the cities. Further consider that the new city
                inhabitants,


                <br> 23)<br>
                as consumers of agricultural products, will again employ so many more hands among the farmers as
                necessary to meet the
                increased needs; that the larger farms will be divided, and that with the expansion of earning
                opportunities, which one
                class gives to the other, and with the division of plots, if small portions become productive through
                doubled diligence,
                as far (considering the physical possibility) as the fertility of the soil and the supply of food it can
                produce allow,
                we see the possibility of how a nation can thus double itself through internal driving forces.
                <br><br>
                It is true, we see only the physical possibility of doubling and not yet the actual degree of increase
                that time and
                prevailing circumstances will truly allow; but the path to it is evident here, which remains closed
                under the current
                constitution of the farming class.<br><br>
                On one side or the other, either in the farming class or in the bourgeoisie, a start must be made; the
                former is within
                the power of the state, and it can be hindered little or not at all by the envy of neighbors, by their
                advantages, or by
                the course of world events in


                <br> 24)<br>
                general. The latter, the beginning of the expansion of trade in the bourgeoisie, is exposed to such
                difficult-to-overcome obstacles, as will be shown in the following considerations on the manufacturing
                industry.

                    Factories.
                </h2>
                Certainly, the expansion of the population can also begin in the bourgeoisie, and where factories
                establish themselves,
                they spread influence and life around them to the farming class, transforming even desolate areas into
                paradises through
                the revitalized diligence of agriculture. However, their establishment is too little within the power of
                a government.
                <br><br>
                In some places, they are the work of time, in others, a fortunate accident; those countries are
                fortunate that once
                gained the lead, and others, which started later or were less favored by random world events, with or
                without their own
                fault, can no longer catch up. In the countries where progress was made earlier, the initial advantage
                was that the
                first manufacturers did not have to contend with competition, so such factories,



                <br> 25)<br>
                whose markets were secure, could more easily thrive. They developed gradually, and not too many of
                various kinds all at
                once; the necessary hands were gradually found and trained, and everything eventually fell into place.
                In other
                countries, which owe their factories to world events and their fortunate willingness to accept refugees
                who left an
                inhospitable homeland with their skills, there was no need to seek and train the necessary skilled hands
                among the old
                inhabitants, as these already arrived fully trained from outside and offered themselves.

                <br><br>
                Everything is quite different in those states where, only in more recent times, spurred by the evident
                prosperity that
                earlier established factories had brought to their states, the establishment of similar factories has
                been attempted.
                The newer factories cannot keep pace with the old ones, and even the best and most benevolent
                governments find
                themselves in great difficulty. A complete ban on the importation of goods that are now to be made
                domestically does not
                take effect until the new factories supply a sufficient quantity of them,


                <br> 26)<br>
                after that, smuggling can hardly be prevented, even with very unpleasant police measures, and the
                lifting of competition
                with foreign factories seems to threaten the domestic ones with eternal mediocrity. If the importation
                of foreign goods
                is allowed and one is content to impose customs duties on them to favor domestic products, one provides
                an opportunity
                for smuggling, which again necessitates unpleasant measures and still cannot be prevented despite all
                efforts and
                caution.
                <br><br>
                The new factories require hands, and thus arises the great question: where are these hands to come from?
                Especially if
                the state has maritime activities, and with a commendable zeal to establish all possible good, wishes to
                bring many
                different kinds of factories into existence at once. The government cannot summon entire populations of
                foreign
                manufacturers, even if they were available, but only individual masters to teach the local hands and set
                them to work.
                But, as mentioned, where are these local hands supposed to come from? They cannot and must not be taken
                from agriculture
                and shipping, and it is also not the intention of such commendable governments,




                <br> 27)<br>
                which certainly regard both of these major industries as having unquestionable priority.
                There are always many idle hands in a state, whether through their own fault or not, less so in the
                countryside and more
                often in the cities, and at all times, in all countries, authorities have been mindful of seeing them
                put to work. There
                are also always some factories in any civilized state that produce goods considered necessities of the
                first degree. But
                we are not talking about these factories or hands here. When we say that a state has factories or lacks
                them, we
                understand not only factories for coarse goods but also factories for finer goods that serve well-being,
                of various
                kinds, and in a considerable number. And by hands needed for this, we do not mean only the hands the
                government can
                provide to the factory owners, which will not go far, especially since they are mostly forced and
                unskilled people, but
                voluntary hands that the manufacturer himself seeks and easily finds at a reasonable price.




                <br> 28)<br><br>

                The operation and maintenance of factories depend entirely on this; however, in my opinion, this cannot
                be expected
                until the population in the farming class has risen to a level where there is an excess of hands that no
                longer find
                sufficient employment in agriculture. Therefore, the path to population growth in the peasant class that
                I have outlined
                is also the path to the flourishing of factories. Namely, the distribution of farms and the
                establishment of new
                families, who should still find their livelihood in agriculture, has its ultimate limit, and thus arises
                the surplus of
                hands to the benefit of urban industries that I am discussing. Some will entirely turn away from
                agriculture to the
                cities, others will remain in the countryside due to the low cost of living, still finding some
                employment in
                agriculture, but otherwise be at the service of manufacturers in the cities and be particularly useful
                in certain
                factories, especially those based on extensive and inexpensive spinning.


                <br><br>
                Then is the right time in the state for factories and manufactures when the manufacturer,


                <br> 29)<br>
                who seeks hands, and the worker, who seeks work, meet each other. At this opportune time, the government
                can, with a
                modest advance to an active manufacturer who risks his own capital, achieve what it would not achieve at
                an inopportune
                time, even with great expenditure. Then, with the expanded industry, which, as I have already said,
                always grows with
                the increased number of people, the greatest possible competition will arise in all classes, and this
                competition will
                ensure that all commercial products, all goods – on one side, the products of agriculture, foodstuffs,
                and the like, and
                on the other side, the products of urban diligence, craftsmen and manufacturers – achieve the highest
                possible quality
                at the lowest possible price. It is important to understand that this only holds if the standard of all
                trade, money,
                remains untouched, and is not ruined and confused by manipulations with money and its circulation,
                which, unfortunately,
                under the influence of some ill-fated star, almost all European states have allowed themselves, through
                the
                overstretching of credit, national debts and their entanglement in commercial matters,



                <br> 30)<br>
                through the substitution of what is not money instead of money, through the accumulation of currency,
                through forced
                methods imposed on circulation – in short, through the alteration of the natural relationship that a
                symbol should have
                to the represented thing.

                according to the
                circumstances of the time. At the same time, I believe it can be safely assumed as a general principle
                in all
                considerations about human enterprise that every person, in their own small sphere, sees further than
                their overseer,



                <br> 31)<br>
                and granted that the knowledge and skills of a farmer who is just entering into the state of freedom and
                has only just
                achieved ownership might be deficient and limited, both will quickly expand under such powerful
                incentives. Since the
                total arises from the contribution of every single pair of hands, it becomes clear that the state or
                nation whose
                individual members make the best use of their land and time must inevitably surpass another nation where
                thousands of
                its members do not make as good use of their land or time.
                <br><br>
                Time is in itself one of the greatest goods, because the use of all other goods depends on how time is
                used. The loss of
                time is always considerable in corvée labor, and it is unbearable where corvée duties are exaggerated
                and arbitrarily
                imposed. Entire days are considered worthless, and the peasant becomes accustomed to valuing them as
                nothing: He is used
                for many tasks that have nothing to do with agriculture; a hundred things happen at inconvenient times,
                and the peasant,
                who must always be available, is often drawn away from working on his own field on the days

                <br> 32)<br>
                that matter most to him. I do not wish to extend the accusations, which only apply to excessive and
                improper corvée
                labor, to landlords who adhere to reasonable and natural corvée duties, but I still assert that these
                duties are also
                associated with a loss of time, namely that corvée labor never accomplishes what the same hands could
                achieve in the
                same time when driven by the impulse of freedom and personal gain. I boldly refer to those landlords
                who, in addition to
                corvée duties, also have part of their fields managed by their own servants, and they will surely admit
                that much more
                is achieved in this way than through corvée labor. It is simply a fact. The work that a person does for
                others does not
                have the same quality as when he works for himself, and although the corvée-performing peasant, in the
                case of
                reasonable corvée labor, should consider that he is fulfilling a condition without which he could not
                expect to inhabit
                the farm on which he lives, this duty still makes little impression on him, and we should not be
                surprised that the
                sense of duty is neither finer nor


                <br> 33)<br>
                stronger in him than in many who are in much better circumstances than the peasant’s conditions tend to
                be. Meanwhile,
                in a thousand places in the state, what could be done is not being done.
                <br><br>
                Contrast this with the household of the free farmer who cultivates his own land. Everything is active
                with him—himself
                and his entire family. In enjoying the immediate fruits of his labor, he learns the value of time. He
                takes note of time
                and opportunity, and arranges his tasks in such a way that none interferes with the others. He puts all
                his family
                members to work, and if the agricultural tasks leave any time unoccupied, it is used for secondary work,
                such as
                spinning. Not everyone will do this, that is true, but among free people, there are reliably always more
                diligent than
                negligent ones.
                <br><br>
                The land will yield more fruits than it does now, and different ones that it does not yet
                produce.<br><br>
                The economy, as it is typically practiced in countries where serfdom prevails and which some of these
                countries take
                great pride in,


                <br> 34)<br>
                is an economy that only exists in a moderately populated land. The pinnacle of skill in this economy
                lies in cultivating
                as large an estate as possible with as few hands as possible, and in obtaining as many products as
                possible for the
                immediate enrichment of the landowner without significant expense, using as few hands as possible. I
                fully understand
                that a great deal of skill and insight into the cultivation of the land can be applied here, and the
                steward or manager
                who possesses these insights is always a valued man in my eyes. I do not generally blame any landowner
                for exploiting
                his property according to the country's customs, but I do hold it against those who deny that a better
                system is
                possible and who block the path to improvement. However, it is precisely the customary way of doing
                things that I
                dislike, and despite all that I have acknowledged, I still maintain the right to assert that this
                economy is proof of a
                low population density, and that the land, however beneficial the economy may seem to the individual, is
                only moderately
                utilized by the state.


                <br> 35)<br>

                And this is evident to the eye: for nothing is more wasteful, for example, than the practice of crop
                rotation combined
                with large-scale dairy farming in relation to the land, as it leaves a large portion of the land in a
                state where it is
                neither arable nor meadow, but merely pasture, lying uncultivated. All the excuses and supposed
                advantages of this
                system fall away when compared with other countries where the land is managed more prudently, and it
                would be better,
                instead of using all other excuses, to acknowledge the true reason, namely, that there are not enough
                hands available to
                keep more land continuously under the plow, and that large-scale dairy farming is more convenient. In
                other regions,
                land is also allowed to rest, but not as often and not for as long, and there are areas where, with
                diligent
                cultivation, the land can do without rest entirely.
                <br><br>
                Consider how much the soil is capable of yielding with diligent cultivation, through all levels of
                labor, up to the
                point where it is directly worked by


                <br> 36)<br>
                human hands with hoes and spades, and compare in your mind the product of such intensive cultivation
                with the product of
                superficial cultivation.
                <br><br>
                Think of how many valuable and profitable crops, beyond just grain and fodder for livestock, the land
                could produce
                without displacing grain and fodder. But for that, hands are needed, which are not even sufficient for
                the cultivation
                of grain.
                <br><br>
                Of a hundred proposals by our economic writers, without a doubt, most are insignificant, perhaps even
                ill-considered and
                inherently impractical. In those lands of servitude, they are all entirely irrelevant, even if they are
                otherwise good
                in theory, due to the circumstance that there is a lack of hands. Thus, economic writings, which suggest
                more profitable
                methods and refinements, seem to come too early everywhere, as there is still so much work remaining on
                the established
                path.
                <br><br>

                Do not praise to me the yield of agricultural exports from such lands. It might be less significant if,
                in return,
                consumption within the country were all the greater. The greater number of people who



                <br> 37)<br>
                would be there to consume a portion of what is now exported could only obtain their share through the
                labor of their
                hands; they would thus produce much within the country that is now paid for with exported goods, and if
                nothing else
                were gained, the ruler would at least have that many more subjects.
                <br><br>
                I say that exports might possibly be smaller, without conceding that they necessarily would be or must
                be. England has
                proven for many years that a country can feed many inhabitants with its grain and still have a
                substantial amount left
                for export. Its current predicament does not invalidate this proof, as the present high prices are not
                so much due to
                physical conditions as to artificial factors. They arise not so much from a shortage of growth as from
                the excessive
                accumulation of money in circulation and the extent of taxation on one side, and from the decline in the
                availability of
                food on the other, making the price of bread unaffordable for the poor city dwellers who live hand to
                mouth.
                <br><br>
                I should hardly need to mention among the possible objections the one that I


                <br> 38)<br>
                have nevertheless heard seriously presented more than once, namely that it is better to have fewer
                wealthy inhabitants
                than many poor ones in the country. If I were to respond seriously, I would demand proof that if there
                were more
                inhabitants, there would necessarily be more poverty among them; I would ask to have the alleged present
                prosperity
                demonstrated more clearly. However, I believe it is enough to recall that we are (should I say, thank
                God, or
                unfortunately?) still quite far from the situation in which, as is said of China, the misery and
                wretched life of the
                common people result from an excess of population.
                <br><br>
                I would rather assist those who find pleasure in such objections with a few more points. If, through the
                subdivision of
                the large estates, the extensive Dutch-style farming were to decline, it would be difficult to expect
                such good butter
                in the future. Indeed, the rapid production of butter from a daily large supply of milk significantly
                contributes to the
                quality of the butter. And since, with the increasing spread of people, the wild game would have to make
                way



                <br> 39)<br>
                for the farmers more and more, game might become as rare as it is in England.

                <h2>
                    Defensive Stand
                </h2>
                Just as the peasant class is the foundation of the state in terms of its internal prosperity, so too is
                it crucial for
                its defense against external threats. The members of this class are not only the most numerous, but they
                are also
                generally equipped with strong and enduring bodies, and are even prepared by their peacetime activities
                to endure the
                hardships of war. Therefore, a government that wishes to secure a reliable state—a state not dependent
                on world
                alliances and international events, but on its own inherent strengths—has the highest reason to ensure
                that the
                structure of the peasant class aligns with this important goal. Such a government must ensure that the
                peasant class’s
                organization supports the aim of self-sufficiency and stability in the face of potential external
                threats.



                <br> 40)<br>

                I am only speaking of the defensive aspect and hope, if the thought is not too bold, that among my
                readers there might
                be princes who are only concerned with defense and not with aggressive wars.<br><br>
                Let me make some considerations about the idea of a militem perpetuum (standing army or eternal
                soldier). If in all
                states, for both defense and attack, only such troops that are constantly under arms are used, and if
                the state relies
                solely on them, the following consequences will follow:<br><br>
                1. A standing army will become the standard by which states and nations are measured against each other
                and measure
                themselves.<br><br>
                2. The spirit of expansion will drive princes to seek an army that is superior in size, armor, and
                training to their
                neighbors', and to make use of it at every opportunity.<br><br>
                3. The neighbors will set up countermeasures.




                <br> 41)<br>
                4. That the weaker states find themselves threatened by the danger of being overwhelmed.<br><br>
                5. That general mistrust and constant competitive jealousy lead to alliances and counter-alliances, the
                involvement of
                all states in the affairs of other states, concern for an imaginary balance, and incessant new
                combinations of state
                systems.<br><br>
                6. That continuous wars are instigated, and peace is mostly just a truce enforced by exhaustion.<br><br>
                7. That most wars quickly become general wars.<br><br>
                8. That in no state are the revenues sufficient to cover the increased state expenses resulting from war
                preparations
                beyond natural capacities.<br><br>
                9. That recourse is taken to national debts, to operations that disturb the standard of all trade and
                industry, and to
                other means which cause long-term harm to the state.<br><br>




                <br> 42)<br>

                These are the consequences confirmed by European history since the introduction of the standing army and
                by the
                experience of our times, to the misfortune of the world.
                But why should a state rely solely on a standing army, which is always under arms and in continuous
                service, yet often
                inadequate in times of need and, at least with respect to the common man, unreliable? Why should it not
                instead arm the
                citizens of the state, who sustain themselves in peacetime and only become a burden to the state during
                wartime? Why not
                consider an arrangement whereby they become as competent in defending their homeland as they are
                reliable in terms of
                their will and loyalty?
                <br><br>

                If a government seriously considers this, it has the power to organize the defense after an attack and
                always to be
                superior in number to the advancing enemy; for the notion that entire nations should fall upon each
                other is no longer
                to be feared in Europe, as trade ties people to their homes. An attacking state



                <br> 43)<br>
                will always act with only a portion of its forces, while the attacked can, if they choose, engage with
                their entire
                force. Thus, one can argue that a nation large enough to be called a nation, with a proper defense
                system, must be able
                to withstand the whole world at home. And if a few European states adopted this approach, which those
                maintaining both a
                maritime and land power might be forced to begin due to the impossibility of managing both
                simultaneously, the standing
                army might disappear as it arose—just as examples led to its establishment. When the hope of overcoming
                unarmed
                neighbors with a standing army fades and, in the case of a daring attack, one must expect the resistance
                of a whole
                nation rather than the weak resistance of a small band of mercenaries, the costly standing army becomes
                redundant.
                <br><br>
                To prove the possibility of such a defensive system without a standing army, on which it is not the
                place here to debate
                or to discuss my actions, examples of





                <br> 44)<br>
                nations and often small states that have become what they are or were, and have maintained or continue
                to maintain
                themselves with such a system, are sufficient. These nations have managed wars with citizens who, with
                one hand, wield
                the plow and, with the other, handle weapons.<br><br>
                Similarly, I do not undertake to show here how national troops should be formed so that they are
                suitable for defensive
                purposes, nor is this the place for it. However, I will make just three points of reminder:<br><br>
                Firstly, it is not enough merely to designate hands meant for defense as recruits who, when the need
                arises, are to be
                taken from the plow and added to the standing army. These hands must be accustomed to arms and military
                discipline in
                advance, and there must be no other difference between them and soldiers who do not lay down their
                weapons than in
                skill, which should not be greater than that which, with stronger and more frequent training, will
                disappear in a short
                time once the national soldier leaves the plow.



                <br> 45)<br>

                Secondly, there should be no shortage of officers, and those who are assigned to the national troops
                should not be
                considered or treated as if they were retired or at rest; rather, their conduct with the national troops
                and the good
                they do there should be the path to promotion.
                <br><br>
                Thirdly, the duty of serving the fatherland under arms should be a universal obligation for every common
                man; it should
                not be a duty arbitrarily imposed on some and exempted for others. It is not to be expected that a
                peasant will become a
                good national soldier while his status remains contemptible and generally despised, which will happen
                where the
                connection is not universal. But where every peasant's son must serve his years, and where the service
                has been made a
                means to establish young peasants, he will serve without complaint, because the burden borne by all
                ceases to be a
                burden, and he will honor the service and become accustomed to the right mindset, which elevates a
                national soldier far
                above the hired soldier, who is always a mercenary,

                first in thought and then, when it comes to action, in deeds.
                <br><br>
                Such a defensive system is easily achievable if the peasant, even if not entirely in ownership, at least
                enjoys freedom.
                It is also possible where the peasant is a serf, but with great and nearly insurmountable difficulties,
                which I leave to
                the landowners to make clear, as they will certainly be aware.

                    Possibility of subdividing large estates without loss of the landowners' privileges and security for
                    the future.
                </h2>
                I desire the subdivision and dissolution of the large estates on the land holdings, but by no means the
                dissolution of
                the land holdings themselves. Noble estates, baronies, and counties should remain, and neither the new
                peasant farms (I
                call them peasant farms, i.e., small farms, regardless of their future occupants, whether they come from
                the peasant
                class or the middle class) arising from the subdivision of the large estates, nor the existing
                obligation farms, which
                have been freed from corvée labor



                <br> 47)<br>
                and have become the property of their inhabitants, should be separated from the landholding estate.
                Rather, they should
                remain parts of the estate.
                <br><br>
                I wish for the peasant class to have complete civil freedom and ownership of the land they cultivate.
                This does not
                prevent the possibility that rights and obligations benefiting the landowners could be attached to the
                land (not to the
                people), just as the territorial rights of the sovereign can be attached to the farm of any free
                peasant, without
                affecting the property rights of the owner. The difference between what we currently call free direct
                peasants and
                peasants on a noble estate will therefore be that one is a direct subject of the prince while the other
                is an indirect
                subject of both the prince and the landowner. One will be wealthier under otherwise equal conditions,
                while the other
                will be less wealthy; both, however, will be free.
                <br><br>
                I would like to satisfy everyone: I would like, on one hand, for the landowners to graciously relinquish
                their
                unnecessary rights and assets to keep their peasants in a state of personal dependency and precarious
                situation,




                <br> 48)<br>
                and to be content with the advantages that their fortunate circumstances and status give them over the
                peasant class. On
                the other hand, I would like the peasants to recognize the value of civil personal freedom and the
                happiness of a secure
                state, and to work with joy and without envy towards the higher classes, seeing that their prosperity
                depends on their
                own hands and efforts.
                <br><br>
                Civil freedom is a term I often use, and I would like to briefly explain the concept I have in mind. By
                it, I mean the
                freedom of every individual to promote and enjoy their prosperity in any way they see fit, as long as it
                is consistent
                with the existence of the society in which they live. An equality of circumstances among all human
                beings is impossible
                and would, even if it were possible in a small civil society, only produce general inertia. However,
                whether rich or
                poor, we can all be free, and I see this freedom as a birthright of every individual. I find no person
                to be pitiable
                while they have their





                <br> 49)<br>
                health and the opportunity to sustain themselves through their own efforts, and I do not believe they
                have cause to wish
                to revert from societal life to a natural state, as Rousseau might suggest.
                <br><br>
                Now, according to this concept, when I take on the role of advocate for the peasants, I am not making
                exaggerated
                demands and am entirely free from the intention of enriching the peasants at others' expense. What I am
                actually
                demanding is nothing more than freedom as defined above; I do not demand ownership of the land for them,
                but merely wish
                for it, and I wish it not out of affection for the peasants but for the state itself, because I believe
                that this would
                make the land serve the state better.<br><br>
                Please forgive me this digression, if it can be called a digression; for in a matter so delicate, where,
                according to
                experience, so much animosity is involved, where finding a middle ground seems so difficult, where so
                much is demanded
                on both sides and so little is conceded, it seems necessary to proceed with caution and impartiality,
                with all due
                respect for neutrality, to clearly determine the point of contention and to specify what is truly being
                demanded as




                <br> 50)<br>
                a right and what is merely wished for as a beneficial provision.
                <br><br>
                Now, with the hope that I have sufficiently demonstrated my impartiality in the eyes of the landowners
                with whom I will
                now engage more closely, and with the reminder that I only wish for the distribution of the main
                estates, not demand it,
                I will proceed to show that my wishes can be fulfilled without harming them.<br><br>
                I say, therefore, that noble estates, baronies, and counties should remain, for I support the author of
                Esprit des lois,
                who finds hereditary nobility particularly beneficial and appropriate to a monarchical state. Without a
                decent fortune
                and a certain outward splendor, the nobility loses its status; however, the prosperity required for
                maintaining nobility
                is more firmly established on land estates than on fortunes in money, other movable assets, or even
                immovable property
                located in cities. On the one hand, the value of land estates is less subject to the fluctuations of
                trade and commerce,
                and on the other hand, and this is a main consideration in this regard,





                <br> 51)<br>
                the wealth in land estates is visible and cannot be lost unnoticed through accidents and poor
                management, without the
                knowledge of the government, which is responsible for ensuring the preservation of the nobility and
                making appropriate
                provisions for that end, without causing inconvenience to other estates.
                <br><br>
                According to Montesquieu’s concept, we should therefore view the nobility as a middle term between the
                majesty of the
                ruler and the lowly status of the common subject, or, if it is permissible to use a mathematical
                concept, as the mean
                proportional. As fitting as this concept is, so praiseworthy is it for the nobility, and in this way,
                since the nobility
                is in a sense what the prince is to the whole state, with regard to the inhabitants of each estate, it
                seems to me that
                the nobility can be quite content with this position.
                <br><br>
                Just as a prince in Europe takes taxes and levies but otherwise allows each subject their personal civil
                liberty, which
                is not further restricted except by any official duties



                <br> 52)<br>
                they may have taken on or by obligations to the community in which they are a citizen, and as the prince
                assures his
                sovereignty by allowing each subject to treat their share of the goods of this life, bestowed by fate,
                as their own
                property, letting the effort and ambition of each person proceed freely without viewing the entire state
                as a great
                domain, with subjects as mere servants who own nothing and whose labor is drawn directly upon himself,
                so would I wish
                the landowners to proceed similarly in relation to the peasants living on their estates. They should
                reserve for their
                own use only as much land or property as is necessary for the immediate use, enjoyment, and convenience
                of a respectable
                family. They should distribute all remaining land, as far as it is not yet divided, into parcels that
                can be managed by
                a single family with their own hands and servants, and also allow further subdivision of these parcels
                where feasible.
                Each parcel should be subject to a canon of



                <br> 53)<br>
                charges such that it yields income equivalent to the present compulsory duties. Other rights and
                privileges should be
                retained by the entire estate; for instance, hunting, provided it does not damage crops; fishing,
                forests from which
                only necessary firewood and especially forest products are taken, and the delivery of necessary peat
                from the moors at
                reasonable fixed prices. Whether they wish to collect the land and state taxes themselves and pay them
                to the prince’s
                treasury in one sum, or whether they prefer to refer each resident of their estate to the prince's tax
                collectors and
                allow these collectors to enforce the levies, should depend on their own choice. Each resident should be
                granted
                ownership of their farm or parcel and to immediately confer general value on this ownership, a debt and
                pledge protocol
                should be established. No part of this land should be sold except where a new farm with a new resident
                family can be
                established either from the division of a larger estate or from combining adjacent farms. The creation
                of such new farms
                should be permitted



                <br> 54)<br>
                or forbidden by the landowner at their discretion, and if permitted, regulated by canon and overall
                constitution. The
                new farm should be given its own entry in the protocol, and the reduction noted on the farms from which
                it originated.
                Services derived from the prince's orders or those that are necessary for the entire estate, considered
                as a commune for
                the benefit of all its residents, are excepted. Besides these, the residents should be entirely free
                from unpaid manual
                and draft labor for the sole benefit of the landowner but bound to certain limited services for payment
                at a fair rate.
                All other prerogatives granted by the prince to the landowner would remain unchanged. In a word, without
                affecting the
                sovereignty of the prince and the unalterable relationship between the sovereign and the subjects,
                whatever their rank,
                the landowner would remain a ruler among the residents of his estate.
                <br><br>
                The stay on the estate, if taste and, may I say? also vocation permit it,


                <br> 55)<br>
                could not fail to be at least as pleasant for the landlord as it is now, for in the management of
                agriculture, which is
                usually entrusted to a tenant or manager, the pleasure of country life cannot be experienced. On the
                contrary, I believe
                that this pleasure would be significantly enhanced by the complete relief from the worries of management
                that comes with
                the division of the main estate. All the benefits that the landlord can provide through his presence,
                for example, the
                opportunities this presence affords the poorer residents of the estate, such as laborers or other
                lower-class
                individuals, always occur at least as well, and I believe much more, that a landlord who views himself
                in the light of a
                regent, through this thought, which is far more exalted than being merely a tenant of his estate, will
                be motivated to
                undertake many actions that are beneficial to his subordinates, himself, and the state.
                <br><br>
                In this way, all loss of dignity and future security for the landowners would be avoided, and now I will
                proceed to the
                question of income.

                    Possibility of Division Without Loss to the Landowners' Income.

                </h2>
                Since I am not referring to any specific country, no detailed calculations are necessary here; these can
                easily be made
                based on the particular circumstances of each location.<br><br>
                Each landowner can and should ensure that the taxes are arranged in such a way that their total equals
                the highest yield
                of the estate, whether under personal administration or leasing, without considering the current and
                potentially greater
                future benefits of the reserved rights and the savings that will result from the new arrangement.
                <br><br>
                I by no means demand that the change should proceed to the detriment of the landowners, nor that
                sacrifices be made for
                the benefit of the state. And although I am convinced of the significant impact of the proposed change
                on the reception
                of the states, I would still abandon such convictions, like any other hopeless wishes, if I were not
                also strongly
                convinced of the

                <br> 57)<br>
                possibility of achieving this without damaging the landowners.
                <br><br>
                But of course, I cannot be dissuaded from this conviction merely by the assertion of the opposite, even
                if the person
                who denies the possibility appeals to many years of experience in agriculture under the current system
                or to their own
                long-standing possession of estates. I will only yield to future experience, which requires trials that
                still need to be
                conducted with due caution. Since I am not so unreasonable as to criticize those who refrain from trying
                it if they find
                it problematic for themselves, it would be unreasonable for them to prevent others from making the
                attempt and to
                reproach me for wishing to do so. I have always, in addition to the probability of my arguments, some
                albeit modest
                trials that have already been made here and there.
                <br><br>

                In essence, the change consists in that the peasants, who previously worked the fields for the lord’s
                account, will now
                cultivate them for their own benefit, delivering to the lord the quantity of produce that remained for
                him after
                deducting the costs,



                <br> 58)<br>
                or its value. The land remains the same, the existing hands that have previously performed the work will
                remain, except
                that they will gradually increase, so the produce will continue to be produced, and its value will also
                remain. The
                concerns would therefore have to focus on two main issues: that the inhabitants of the estate will not
                be able to
                sustain themselves because their number will increase, or that they will be unable or unwilling to pay
                their dues
                because they have become their own masters.
                <br><br>
                I will first consider this lighter concern, and indeed in the double sense of the chosen expression that
                the peasant has
                become his own master. In one sense, this means: The peasant is now left to himself, and recourse to the
                lord is no
                longer "open" to him. Concerning the resulting concern, I state in advance, what I will later show in
                more detail when
                considering the difficulties that must be addressed, that indeed the peasant, upon entering the new
                state of freedom,
                will need support and arrangements for his establishment, but nothing more than





                <br> 59)<br>
                what is quite feasible. Further and continuous support will neither be needed nor demanded by him, nor
                should it be
                offered, nor would it be possible for the lord to provide it. Although it often happens under the
                current system that
                the lord must support the peasant, and the peasant naturally seeks as much help as he can get, it is
                undisputed that it
                is not the peasants who live off the lord, but rather he and his estate live from their work, and this
                situation cannot
                be reversed, despite the fanciful ideas of some defenders of the traditional system who would like to
                believe that the
                peasant’s existence cannot be imagined without the lords.
                <br><br>
                In the other sense, the above words mean retaining freedom and property, and instead of this new state
                of the peasant
                causing concern once he is established in it after overcoming the initial difficulties, it must rather
                alleviate them.
                The powerful self-love and the assurance of certain immediate enjoyment of the fruits of his labor will
                surely


                <br> 60)<br>
                inspire and energize him to maintain his farm and thus fulfill the associated obligations: he will
                surely want to, and
                will also be able to.
                <br><br>
                The other concern, which arises from the accumulation of inhabitants on the estate and whether it can
                sustain them
                without cost to the landowner, assumes that more hands would not result in more products. Yes, if this
                were the case, if
                the benefit that a landowner derives from his estate were all that the estate currently produces, and
                could produce
                under better conditions, then indeed the new inhabitants of the subdivided estate would not have a
                place. But even under
                the current system, what the landowner benefits from the products of the estate is only a part of
                them—who knows how
                small a part? Whether leased or managed, tenants and managers, along with their people, also live from
                it and seek to
                live well, and who can blame them? Their share is thus initially part of the subsistence of the new
                inhabitants of the
                subdivided estate.



                <br> 61)<br>
                Furthermore, these new inhabitants will work more, they will cultivate the land far better than the
                previous laborers
                did, and the better-cultivated, more carefully tended land—which is certainly far from the highest level
                of productivity
                in the regions we are discussing—will produce more and sufficient products for their livelihood.
                <br><br>
                A landowner who is inclined to implement the proposed change on his estate can, therefore, safely and
                confidently impose
                on the parcels of the subdivided estate and on the freed farms as many taxes as necessary to provide a
                reasonable
                equivalent of his current income. However, he must ensure that the distribution is fair and
                proportional.
                <br><br>
                The main estates usually have certain rights and freedoms attached, such as exemption from special
                landowner
                contributions (specifically where only the farmland, not the entire estate including lord’s land and
                peasant land, is
                considered as a whole), exemption from the obligation to serve in national troops and other personal
                services to the
                prince, the right to brew and bake for household use,



                <br>62)<br>
                freedom for oxen fattening, exemption from tithes, and so forth. These freedoms must also be transferred
                with the
                parcels of the subdivided main estate and be considered in the canon of taxes to be set. It must also be
                taken into
                account that usually the land in these parcels is better cultivated than the land of the mandatory
                farms, which is why
                higher amounts can be charged for tithe exemption and exemption from farm service.
                <br><br>
                The customary farm service at each location, insofar as it was fair, should be assessed in monetary
                terms and adjusted
                according to the fair judgment of the service that the landowner received and the benefit that the
                farmer can obtain
                elsewhere after being relieved of the service.<br><br>
                If the farmer already pays monetary taxes according to local customs in addition to the labor services,
                this should
                remain unchanged.<br><br>
                If the farmer is already subject to land tax, he should continue to pay it: If the landowner pays the
                tax for the entire
                estate in full, he allocates a proportionate share of this tax to each freed farm.



                <br><br>
                63)<br>
                A compensation for the property rights that the former serf farmer receives could also be
                considered.<br><br>
                Thus, the canon for the taxes from a portion of the main estate could consist of the following
                categories:<br><br>
                A. Instead of land tax.<br><br>
                B. Instead of tithes.<br><br>
                C. Instead of farm services.<br><br>
                D. Received monetary payments.<br><br>
                <h4>For the freed mandatory farms:</h4> <br><br>
                E. Received monetary payment.<br><br>
                F. Instead of farm services.<br><br>
                G. For property rights.<br><br>
                or whatever it might be called according to local customs..<br><br>
                Uncultivated plots of land, such as swamps or moors, should be excluded from the assessment, but I would
                reserve them as
                a landowner, with the hopeful expectation that, if not for me, then for my heirs, as reclaiming such
                plots would
                certainly be worthwhile. Whether new farms could be established from them or simply meadowland,





                <br>
                64)<br>
                this meadowland would be eagerly sought by all the occupiers of the adjacent portions, to the great
                benefit of the
                landowner.
                <br><br>
                Both the inhabitants of the portions and the freed serfs would be allocated a certain annual quantity of
                firewood and
                nutwood, and this would be reflected in a reasonable addition to the canon. Additionally, all would
                receive the initial
                necessary supply of hazel, alder, and thorn bushes for establishing hedges free of charge, and possibly
                for up to six
                years to maintain the hedges properly. After that, the free provision would end, and the use of the
                saved underbrush for
                burning, charcoal, etc., would become significant.<br><br>
                The peat bogs would remain the property of the landowner, who would allocate an annual quota of peat to
                each resident.
                <br><br>
                With the increasing population across the entire state and the growing number of inhabitants on each
                estate in
                particular, the consumption of fuel would significantly rise. However, it does not necessarily follow
                that there would
                be an absolute shortage of it,


                <br> 65)<br>
                or that prices would become excessively high. This is because it is indeed very possible, on the one
                hand, to make both
                the forests and peat bogs more productive and to preserve them from depletion through proper management,
                and on the
                other hand, to reduce overall consumption through more prudent use of fuel in each household. As for the
                latter, high
                prices will naturally encourage this. Regarding the former, I confidently expect the landowners to take
                action, as they
                will increasingly recognize and directly feel the value of their forests as the population grows. The
                allure of
                immediate profit will drive them to do what consideration for the future and care for future generations
                might struggle
                to achieve. What benefits might not the landowners see from their forests and peat bogs when the many
                residents of their
                estates, right on their doorstep, purchase the products of their woodland and peatland at high prices,
                when so many new
                homes are built, when brick kilns are needed, and so on? However, I cannot delve deeper into this
                subject here.
                <br><br>
                The fencing in the forest, which would be completely closed off





                <br> 66)<br>
                to the residents of the new farms, could, with appropriate precautions to prevent the livestock from
                damaging the
                growing and sprouting trees, also become a source of income not accounted for here.<br><br>
                Similarly, a recognition fee could be established for the landowner from every new possessor of an old
                or new farm,
                whether obtained by inheritance or purchase.<br><br>
                Furthermore, the savings on certain items, which I do not demand the landowner consider when determining
                the taxes,
                would become significant.<br><br>
                With the cessation of large-scale farming on the main estate, the maintenance of expensive farm
                buildings would no
                longer be necessary. If it reaches the point where they are entirely superfluous and are dismantled, the
                materials could
                be used to build homes on the new plots.<br><br>
                The farmer, who has obtained ownership, would thereafter have to manage on his own, paying his
                contributions to the
                sovereign, ensuring adequate livestock, and maintaining his house in good repair. This would result in
                significant
                savings for the landowner on outstanding contributions, assistance with gifted livestock, building aid,
                and similar
                expenses.

                <h2>
                    Procedure for Implementing the Subdivision.
                </h2>
                First and foremost, if I were the owner of an estate whose subdivision I had decided upon, I would have
                two correct and
                precise situational maps of my estate made. In one, the current division of the land, the location and
                boundaries—whether imaginary or established—of each farm, the cultivated or uncultivated patches of
                land, and every
                house should be represented, in short, its civil constitution. In the other, the natural
                characteristics, the
                orientation according to the cardinal directions, elevations and depressions, water surfaces, forests,
                flowing and
                standing water, swamps, peat bogs, fields, meadows, pastures, or grazing land, and the soil quality of
                each patch would
                be depicted.<br><br>
                Both maps should be created on the same scale, detailed, and reliable enough that I could accurately
                assess any given
                patch of land from my room by looking at the map and consider what could be done with it, just as if I
                were physically
                standing on that piece of land. If the space of a



                <br> 68)<br>
                general map is found to be too small to indicate everything necessary, then specialized maps would be
                made.
                <br><br>
                Next, I would seek to disentangle myself from any communal ties with my neighboring landowners, and if
                this could not be
                done amicably, I would petition the sovereign to separate us, for it is impossible to dissolve a
                community without
                allowing every participant, even if they only have an air of discontent, to demand their share.<br><br>
                Once the boundaries of the estate have been clarified all around, I would also seek to eliminate any
                conflicts within
                the estate that might arise from inconvenient distribution of land or shared ownership among the
                farmers.<br><br>
                Then I would consider the gradual division of my main estate. I emphasize gradual division because,
                among other reasons,
                I would be concerned about ruining the market for myself if I offered too many parcels at once.<br><br>
                First, I would plan to reduce my main estate if it exceeded the natural and fair proportion between
                lord's land and
                peasant land, bringing it down to the proportion that is just or perhaps has been



                <br> 69)<br>
                established by the sovereign in the meantime. With this excess lord's land, which due to a lack of
                sufficient labor
                services would have to be cultivated by my own carts and plows, I would begin the process of
                subdivision.
                <br><br>
                I would not assign the portions a larger size than what seems necessary and sufficient for the
                sustenance of a good
                farming family. This is not to discourage others who might wish to acquire larger plots—they can simply
                combine multiple
                portions—but rather to lay the groundwork for future division and to immediately provide an opportunity
                for those who
                can only manage a single portion to participate as well.<br><br>
                The prospective buyers and residents I expect for these portions include: tenant farmers who have
                managed to establish
                themselves and now wish to cultivate their own land, preferably a plot they can manage with their own
                resources without
                borrowing money—these are the most desirable residents because, as experienced farmers,





                <br> 70)<br>
                they will teach the other farmers through their example; city dwellers, estate servants, merchants, and
                small
                capitalists—people who long for the peace of rural life; younger sons of moderately wealthy families who
                have no
                prospects for a career in government service, trade, or other occupations for which they have not
                acquired the necessary
                skills and knowledge; daughters to whom their parents might give such a portion as the most reliable
                dowry; and perhaps,
                in some cases, factory owners whose factories operate best in the countryside—all people with ready cash
                in hand who
                will be attracted by the privileges attached to these portions.welche durch die auf die Portionen
                haftende Immunitäten
                werden angelocket werden.

                <br><br>
                When I have selected the portions, I would first mark them in the field with stakes and note the
                boundaries that are to
                be drawn later. I would also have a special situational map created for each portion. Then, I would
                announce my plan and
                invite interested parties to inspect the portions.

                <br>

                <br> 71)<br>
                During the auction to be held, each portion would be assessed with the canon of an annual levy to be
                taken over and
                awarded to the one who bids the highest on the canon. I would have all portions assessed individually,
                and whoever
                desired several adjoining portions would have to either make an acceptable offer privately or ensure
                that they were the
                highest bidder on each portion they desired.<br><br>
                As soon as a portion finds its interested party, the boundary, which was initially only marked with
                stakes on the map,
                would be physically marked out by digging a trench around it, and preparations for this would begin
                immediately.<br><br>
                I would leave it to each interested party to decide whether they wanted to build their own house or have
                it built by me
                according to a design and agreement. In the latter case, the cost could remain as a standing debt, with
                the interest
                added to the canon.
                <br><br>
                Since my buyer does not pay a purchase price but instead takes on an annual canon, while I hand over
                capital whose
                interest is equal to the canon, it is understood that I would retain




                <br> 72)<br>
                priority rights for all claims against him, should he give cause, just as the prince has regarding
                outstanding
                contributions.<br><br>
                With the continued and gradual division of the main estate, the changes would simultaneously apply to
                the farmland.
                According to the proportion set by the prince or adopted by me in accordance with fairness, a
                corresponding portion of
                farmland would be freed along with each portion of the lord’s land that is sold. To that end, I would
                always select the
                most sensible and reliable farmers, making every effort to ensure they recognize the advantage and
                develop worthy ideas
                about their new state of freedom in owning property. Then, I would open a debt and mortgage registry at
                the district
                court or, if the estate has its own court, at that location, and permit a freed farmer to borrow money
                up to a certain
                amount against his farm.

                    The question of what is just?

                </h2>
                Precisely because I consider the proposed change to be highly beneficial and believe that its
                implementation would give
                the entire state a different appearance, I wish that only sound arguments would be used to defend this
                good cause, and
                that only proper measures would be adopted for its execution. For if the desired success were thwarted
                by hasty and
                forceful measures, not only would a convulsive disruption of the entire state's economy be the immediate
                consequence for
                the present, but all hope for the future would also vanish to the extent that the possibility of change,
                which is
                already disputed by some, would be contested with more apparent justification. "It is not feasible,"
                they will say,
                "after all, it has been tried!"
                <br><br>
                I have already touched upon the question, "What is just?" earlier and now feel compelled to delve
                further into it. I
                therefore say: the entirety of the land from which an estate is composed is the property of the lord of
                the manor, the
                farmland as well as the main estate. Anyone who leads

                constitution of the stronger ruling over the weaker, is making an effort that is superfluous with me. I
                am far from
                wishing myself back to feudal times personally or praising them as the good old days. However, I must
                remind you that it
                is fair to judge people according to the mindset of their time, and therefore, under the constitution of
                the peasantry
                at that time, neither the intention may have been so malicious, nor the oppression so great overall.
                Certainly, the nobility (all warriors) regarded the land as their property and those who cultivated it
                as their serfs.
                What would the land mean to them without hands to cultivate it, and how were they, as vassals of the
                sovereign, to
                assist him in his wars if they were not assured of their subordinates? Thus, it could hardly have been
                otherwise than
                that the peasants, together with their families, had to be bound to the estate. Meanwhile, in those
                days, when there was
                so little industry, so little trade, and so little luxury, and when the nobility lived on their estates,
                the needs of
                the lord of the manor were more easily satisfied.




                <br> 75)<br>
                He was content with the plentiful enjoyment of the direct produce of his estate and gladly allowed his
                peasants to eat
                their fill, and what was sufficient for all of them could be achieved without great laborious work, so
                that a precise
                determination of the corvée duties was not considered necessary, as the need for them was not so
                evident.
                Gradually, trade expanded, commerce increasingly converted all goods into money, and thus, the condition
                of the laboring
                peasant first became more burdensome as more and more was demanded of him—much like how, in more recent
                times, when the
                insurance of ships became more common, the profession of seafarers, who had to exert themselves to the
                utmost, became
                more arduous. Now, as far as the exaggeration of the corvée duties is concerned, this belongs to the
                question that will
                be dealt with immediately hereafter. But as for the property rights of the lords of the manor over the
                land—whether such
                rights were originally founded on the law of nature or not—the property rights of the current owners,
                after having been
                recognized and accepted for such a long time and having passed from one hand to another, are entirely
                indisputable. For
                if this title to possession





                <br> 76)<br>
                were not unquestionable, what, indeed, would remain among the goods of the world that a person could
                truly call their
                own?
                <br><br>
                If the land is indeed the property of the lord of the manor, then he also has the right to manage and
                govern it, and to
                use it in the way he deems best. If he is told (and even if the sovereign himself tells him): "Here is a
                better way: you
                could grant the farms, which your peasants currently inhabit, to them as their property, abolish the
                corvée duties, and
                instead establish a certain payment; you could divide the main estate, levy a payment on each portion,
                and in this way
                offer them to new inhabitants, so that you lose nothing and the state gains," if he is told this, then
                it must be
                permissible for him to respond: “We are not yet convinced that this change is feasible, and even if it
                is feasible, the
                appropriate time would have to be chosen in each place. Meanwhile, until we find further conviction and
                the right time,
                we ask to be left with the way in which we have fared well for so long.”



                <br> 77)<br>
                It may be unpleasant for a prince, who seeks the best for his country and is convinced of the utility of
                such a change,
                to see the best interest of the state being delayed, but he will have patience until his own example
                brings about
                conviction, and until other measures—without infringing on the property rights of his subjects, which
                must be sacred to
                every government, regardless of its kind—lead to the point when the desired change occurs naturally and
                without
                coercion. Nothing has caused more misfortune in the world than the violent mindset of those who wish to
                force people for
                their own good: this has always been, in religion, the source of persecution, and, in temporal matters,
                the suppression
                of the diligence and endeavors of people in their trades. It is enough to remind a European prince of
                the dire
                consequences of this way of thinking to make it detestable to him.
                <br><br>
                If the property rights of the lord of the manor over the obligatory farm of the laboring peasant are
                indisputable, it is
                equally certain, on the other hand, that the lord has no rights over the person of the peasant, nor over
                his
                descendants, and that princes who have abolished this unnatural claim in their states have acted as wise
                and just
                rulers.



                <br> 78)<br>
                The lord of the manor cannot demand more than that the person to whom he grants a farm should, in
                return, provide
                services, just as that person must agree to provide these services if he wishes to have the farm.
                Coercion is
                unnecessary to bind them to each other; rather, their mutual needs will draw and keep them together much
                more reliably.
                If the lord of the manor needs hands to cultivate his land, then the peasant, who possesses nothing but
                his own hands,
                needs land, and the lord need only be fair, and the peasant diligent and orderly, for them to be content
                with each
                other.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, as the greatest part of the state's wealth lies in the land, and the greatest part of its
                subjects in the
                peasant class, the sovereign has every reason and right to keep a watchful eye on the relationship and
                the contracts
                between the lords of the manor and the laboring peasants, ensuring that the peasants can find their
                livelihood in such a
                way that they can sustain themselves and find joy in their lives. Therefore, even if the sovereign
                cannot rightly order
                the abolition of serf labor and the dissolution of the manorial estates,



                <br> 79)<br>
                he can certainly mandate the written establishment of appropriate farm duties and prohibit arbitrary
                treatment.
                <br><br>
                After this first step, which is done by decree, everything else will happen gradually and voluntarily,
                and will be
                undertaken by the lords themselves without further orders, provided they are given time to reflect and
                that their
                concerns are alleviated through assurances, provisions, and examples set by the sovereign.<br><br>
                Following the determination of farm duties, there will undoubtedly remain a considerable portion of the
                manorial estates
                on many properties, which the lords will have to cultivate with their own plows and carts, and in this,
                few will find
                their benefit.
                <br><br>
                It is more than likely that everyone will find the clear revenue from the levies placed on the portions
                of the
                subdivided estate more appealing than the previous benefits from leasing or self-management,
                particularly because of the
                relief from many expenses associated with the former way of farming, and from the liability for the
                taxes owed to the
                sovereign by the peasants. However, their concerns, which I will immediately point out,




                <br> 80)<br>
                must be alleviated.
                And since these concerns can largely be addressed by the sovereign, I would strongly advise a prince to
                do everything
                possible in this regard, as no one has more to gain or lose from this matter than the prince himself,
                because the
                proposed changes are the means to bring the state to prosperity with an increasing population.

                <br><br>
                The liability concerning the sovereign's taxes is, for many, the greatest concern. "If," they say, "we
                were to grant the
                peasant freedom and ownership and leave him to his own conduct, how could we be sureties for his taxes
                to the sovereign,
                and how could we ourselves be assured of the dues we ought to receive?" I believe the prince can safely
                endeavor to calm
                the lords of the manor with regard to this twofold concern, provided that the emancipation of the
                peasants is carried
                out with due caution.
                <br><br>
                Namely, one must not set all the peasants, without distinction, into this new and unfamiliar state at
                once, but only the
                most reasonable and industrious ones, those who feel the value of freedom and ownership, and certainly
                not against
                anyone’s


                <br> 81)<br>
                own will or inclination. Those serf peasants who do not wish for any change should be left as they are.
                <br><br>
                One must ease the transition for these peasants (I mean the serf peasants to be emancipated, not the
                future residents of
                the portions created from the main estate), who certainly for the most part have little money at their
                disposal. They
                should be given well-organized and maintained farms, and they must be protected against total ruin.
                Their houses should
                be insured against fire damage. Regarding the unfortunate cattle plague, for which there is little hope
                of eradication,
                it would also be conceivable to establish an insurance institution that could be combined with the one
                for fire damage,
                in case the loss of livestock is considered one of the burdens that inevitably hinders the peasant's
                subsistence —
                although there is still much to be said about this.
                If the houses, as they are now, and the livestock holdings seem inadequate to the peasant, the landlord
                could first
                bring the farm to an appropriate condition in both respects, consider this expenditure as capital
                charged against the
                estate, and transform the interest into a levy.





                <br> 82)<br>
                However, this should be done in such a way that it remains open to the peasant, who gradually gains
                strength, to relieve
                themselves of this levy by reimbursing the capital.
                <br><br>
                One must also, as previously mentioned, open a debt and mortgage protocol, so that the peasant can seek
                money
                everywhere.<br><br>
                With these precautions in mind, I would advise a prince, rather than allow a change that could be seen
                as a conquest in
                times of peace to be delayed, to forever release those landlords who request it from the surety for the
                sovereign
                contributions, and even to assume the guarantees for the levies that the landlord should receive from
                the emancipated
                peasants for a trial period of ten years, starting from the day each farm is freed. Indeed, if a
                landlord does not have
                enough courage or resources to take the necessary measures for the establishment of the peasants, it
                would be better to
                advance them the proven necessary funds under favorable conditions, with slightly lower interest rates
                than usual in the
                country, and not to set a repayment period that is too short. In doing so, I do not believe that a
                prince would, in
                essence, be risking anything or facing any danger.


                <br>83)<br>
                For why should we fear the worst and be anxious about the survival of the peasants under such conditions
                and
                precautions? We have relieved them of everything that exceeds their abilities, from the risk of
                misfortunes that could
                suddenly bring them down, and from the initial expenses for setting up their farm. We ask nothing of
                them but diligence,
                the intelligent use of their hands and time, and sensible management. Why should freedom and ownership
                not have the same
                effect on the peasants in these lands, which they have had on other nations at all times? As for the
                skill and knowledge
                of the peasant, I do not see, since his occupation remains the same as it is now, why he should not
                cultivate the land
                just as well in all respects when he works for himself as he did before when he served. Moreover, he
                will see before his
                eyes the residents of the free farms that have arisen from the main estate — for example, tenants who
                settle there — as
                teachers and examples of good agriculture.


                <br>
                <br> 84)<br>
                I do not hold it against any landlord who is concerned about the issue I seek to address; in fact, I
                completely agree
                with them that a sudden change in the condition of the peasant, without proper preparation for entering
                this new state,
                would be highly problematic. However, I do take issue with those who would like to convince us that the
                existence of the
                peasant cannot be conceived without the current dependence on the landlord, that he — how shall I put
                it? — cannot do
                without the guiding rein or the bridle of the landlord. I regard this claim as nothing more than a
                pretext and a
                disguise for their desire to maintain dominion over their subordinate subjects.

                Even if one were to find oneself deceived by one or another of the freed peasants, contrary to the good
                opinion one had
                of them, no other harm would result than that which should rightfully fall upon the poor subject. It is
                understood that
                no arrears should be held against them, neither to the landlord nor to the sovereign, and that no one
                else would lend to
                them without demanding the annual receipt for both types of taxes.



                <br>85)<br>
                If one did not want to entirely abandon them to their fate, out of fear of losing a subject completely
                from the state,
                it would often be appropriate for the landlord to place another capable man among his peasants on the
                freed farm and to
                take the poorly rated freedman back onto a serf's farm, as a favor. This would be regarded as a favor,
                granted only upon
                his request and in the hope of improvement. Whether such an exchange occurs or not, the abandoned farm
                would not remain
                unoccupied. In general, we must elevate our conceptions of the property we wish to grant to the peasant.
                In all parts of
                the world where civil freedom prevails, usually with even greater burdens than in less free countries,
                possession of a
                share of land is seen as a blessing and the most secure form of possession. Only in those countries
                where the peasant's
                status is so disadvantageous is possession seen as a burden, and one hears that peasants must sometimes
                be forced


                <br> 86)<br>
                to take on a duty farm, and the landlord is anxiously worried that his peasants might run away. But if
                circumstances are
                entirely changed, must we not adjust our views accordingly? If the peasant has freedom and ownership for
                taxes that are
                by no means exorbitant, why should he run away, and to where? To a land with no taxes and where an
                establishment is
                ready for anyone who arrives? We should not imagine the peasant to be so devoid of understanding and
                feeling.

                <h2>
                    Difficulties to be Considered in the Implementation of the Change Across the Entire Country

                </h2>
                The desired change cannot be implemented all at once but must be achieved gradually.

                <br><br>

                In the discussion about population and the distribution of the main estates, as the safest approach to
                this, I have
                shown that by distributing the lord's land, space will be created for many thousands of new families.
                However, these
                families do not appear all at once; rather, these new inhabitants of the state, who will certainly



                <br> 87)<br>
                come over time if space is prepared for them, will partly still need to be born. Therefore, it is not
                feasible to
                abolish the corvée services and free the peasants on any estate before understanding what can be done
                with the main
                estate. Initially, one can only expect that, after determining the corvée services, any surplus of the
                lord's land, for
                which no corvée services remain, will be divided into small farms or, as I call them, portions.


                <br><br>

                Thus, no one can blame a landowner for trying to maximize the return from these portions, because if the
                change is to be
                beneficial, it must also be sustainable, and the division of the main estate is a permanent arrangement.
                Now, if a
                landowner were to divide his entire main estate in such a manner all at once and offer it in portions,
                or if a similar
                arrangement were to be implemented simultaneously across many estates in a province, or even across an
                entire country at
                once, it would undoubtedly ruin the market for these landowners.


                <br>88)<br>
                I have calculated what kind of enthusiasts can be expected as entrepreneurs and residents of the
                portions: there are
                always a few such people in every district, but never many in any one place at the same time. If not too
                many portions
                are offered for sale at once, they will be in high demand by such enthusiasts, because each portion
                retains the
                privileges of the main estate. For the security of these privileges forever, the firm assurance of the
                sovereign is
                certainly necessary, just as it is in his interest to see the desired change accomplished for the
                inevitable prosperity
                of the state.<br><br>
                Consider, in their full extent, all the preparations required to establish the household affairs of many
                new families at
                once. A landowner who is mindful of the future reputation of his family and has the necessary means will
                willingly
                support the new settlers on his estate, assured that his capital is securely invested. Gradually, he
                will be able to do
                many things that he would have to leave undone if there were too much to do at once. The new settlers
                need houses,
                furniture, livestock, and loans in cash; for all these things, solutions will gradually be found.
                However, if too much
                has to happen all at once, the forests will be overexploited beyond capacity, skilled laborers will
                flock to where the
                new income


                <br> 89)<br>
                opportunities arise, and circulating money will also be drawn there to the detriment of other trades.
                The houses will be
                poorly built and too expensive, the initial excitement will soon dissipate, and the sudden,
                disproportionate activity
                will be followed by a sluggishness that I cannot better compare than to that which usually manifests
                itself in those
                places after peace is restored, where a tumultuous wartime economy had briefly caused a strong
                circulation.
                <br><br>
                If we continue our considerations on the liberation of the serf, the difficulties at the beginning (for
                why should the
                difficult beginnings here be any different) will be all the greater, since the number of serfs, compared
                to those new
                inhabitants of the lord's land, is large, and their proprietary wealth in the same comparison is very
                small. There may
                be individual serfs who would be able to immediately take over their farms as they are, without further
                support at their
                own expense, and be able to satisfy both the landlord and the sovereign for the taxes incumbent on both.
                But speaking
                generally of these serfs, they are certainly not in a position to become their own masters without the
                necessary
                measures, indicated in the preceding, to enter into this new state.




                <br> 90)<br>
                However, neither the landlords nor the sovereign themselves are rich enough to implement the measures
                all at once
                throughout the entire state, and the debt and mortgage registers would be of no use if too many wanted
                to borrow at
                once. I think I have expressed myself strongly enough when I rejected the claim that the serf could
                never exist without
                dependence on the landlord, but I must also say that it would be just as unfeasible to place a feeble
                person, accustomed
                to crutches, on an open field, take away his crutches at once, and tell him: now walk alone, or to plant
                a still-weak
                tree without supports and stakes before it can take root, as it would be to release our serfs in their
                still feeble
                condition without further measures.
                <br><br>
                Do we even know if freedom is a pleasant gift for all of them? And do we want to impose it upon them?
                Shouldn't we fear,
                from



                <br> 91)<br>
                some, and particularly from the most reasonable, the complaint and reproach that a burden is being
                placed upon their
                shoulders that they are not yet ready to bear? And must we not fear that, among the less sensible ones,
                who have
                mistaken notions of freedom, this freedom may degenerate into insolence and aversion to diligence and
                work, and that
                from their incapacity a hopeless begging will arise? Is there not a great difference between one
                province and another,
                so that in one a change can take place more easily than in another, especially due to the easier or more
                difficult
                monetization of the products, so that there might be regions where the farmer would rather perform
                services than pay
                money in place of those services? Who can know all the specific circumstances in each place, upon which
                the outcome at
                that place depends, except the landlord, and, as a landlord, the sovereign only on his own domains?
                <br><br>
                So it is said: "Make haste slowly." One can, in thought, connect the future with the present moment, and
                he who plants a
                tree can imagine that tree laden with fruits and rightly claim the gratitude of those who will one day
                enjoy the fruits.
                But time keeps its



                <br>92)<br>
                course, and the tree needs time to grow. The gratitude of posterity, along with the feeling of having
                acted according to
                one's great purpose, should inspire praiseworthy princes to make great decisions, to encourage them to
                proceed with
                persistent steadiness according to a well-laid plan, and to protect them from weariness in the face of
                obstacles that
                require patience and tolerance. Even if they do not, like the one to whom I have dared to dedicate these
                thoughts, have
                the hope—which every one of my readers, surely, joins me in wishing him—that they will themselves still
                see many fine
                harvests after well-planned sowing.

                <h2>
                    Example that the prince can set on his estates.

                </h2>
                The prince cannot command the partitioning of the main estates, but he can set the example on his own
                estates and
                implement the desired change in such a way that it would be recognized as feasible without harming the
                landowners.<br><br>
                He can also reward those who follow his example with marks of favor.<br>



                <br> 93)<br>
                If the example that the prince can set is to be useful and inspire followers, the change must be
                implemented in such a
                way that it must be undeniably recognized as feasible without harm to the landowner. First, the entire
                procedure should
                be publicly documented in print, and then for several years, evidence must be shown of the stability and
                successful
                progress of the arrangement. This should also be done by those who are the first to follow the example
                set by the
                prince, especially if they are honored by the prince with recognition and distinctions for their
                adherence. This way, no
                landowner can truthfully say: "Yes, the prince can do that, or this or that great man can do that, who
                has more
                resources and does not mind a loss with which he buys the prince's favor, but I and others, whose entire
                prosperity
                depends on their sole estate, cannot do it.”
                <br><br>
                And not only because of the example, but also because of the sovereign's treasury, the change must take
                place without
                any loss of princely revenues, and if that could not be achieved, I would not recommend it at all.
                Therefore, I propose
                the involvement


                <br>94)<br>
                of a commissioner from the manorial chamber at each location, who should oversee the maintenance of
                princely revenues,
                even if only for the sake of the public, so that they would not think that, in order to favor a plan
                that one had once
                decided to enforce, one might overlook other considerations.<br><br>
                For a similar reason, I advise including the usual local authority, the magistrate, as the natural
                protector of the
                peasantry, and an advocate for the peasants chosen by themselves in the endeavor, and to remove all fear
                and appearance
                of arbitrary actions, but rather to show that the prince, in a situation where he is regarded as the
                lord of his
                domains, does not wish to act otherwise.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, I refer to what I have already mentioned regarding how to begin with the dissolution and
                distribution of a
                main estate and the emancipation of the peasants.

                <h2>
                    Determination of feudal services.

                </h2>
                Not the dissolution of the main estates, but rather the written judicial determination of feudal
                services can be
                commanded by the prince. This will pave the way for the change I desire; at the very least, it will
                reach the fourth of
                the stages in the constitution of the peasantry mentioned above.<br><br>
                To this end, I would advise the prince to appoint commissioners who should travel throughout the
                country, forming a
                court pro quolibet passu in loco everywhere as directors, not as judges. This court should be composed
                of persons
                familiar with the local conditions, one-third chosen by themselves, one-third chosen by the landlord,
                and one-third
                chosen by the peasants, allowing both parties to plead their cases.
                <br><br>
                The reasons for the procedure I propose are self-evident and are similar to those concerning the example
                at the domains.
                I would like the strictest impartiality to be observed in a matter that is so important for both the
                landlord and the
                peasants. Therefore,


                <br> 96)<br>
                I say that the prince’s commissioners should not themselves adjudicate but should only oversee the court
                to remove any
                suspicion that the implementation of a scheme intended to be executed might now be reconsidered.<br><br>
                Landowners should be reminded in advance to keep reliable, fiducial situational maps ready to present to
                the
                commissioners and the court.<br><br>
                When the commissioners are presented with a settlement already agreed upon between the landlord and his
                peasants, they
                must assess whether it conforms to their instructions and question both parties to determine whether
                they have freely
                and voluntarily entered into and accepted the settlement. Only then can the commissioners, on behalf of
                the prince,
                approve the settlement.
                <br><br>
                The commissioners should receive nothing from the parties except decent provision during their stay on
                location, and the
                sovereign would pay them their allowances from his treasury.



                <br> 97)<br>
                Before the regulation of the corvée labor can begin, there must be an ordinance in place that serves as
                a guideline for
                the princely commissioners, for the arbitrators, and for the parties who wish to establish their
                contracts without
                intermediaries.

                <br><br>
                However, this guideline must allow for the various modifications that the particular circumstances of
                each place may
                require — not only those concerning an estate in general, but even specific areas, such as the varying
                nature of the
                terrain, the different ratio between arable land and meadowland, the distance of each farmstead from the
                lord’s manor,
                and local customs. Therefore, all who are given the princely general guideline must also be granted
                permission to apply
                the guideline fairly, without being strictly bound to its wording as if it were law. Generally, just as
                in the entire
                matter where the landlord and his peasants are seen as contracting parties, the assessors appointed to
                this task in each
                locality should also be regarded as arbitrators.



                <br> 98)<br>
                To provide an outline of the main features of the proposed guideline, I must first briefly consider the
                common corvée
                services in terms of their nature and mode of performance.<br><br>
                The corvée services, generally classified, consist of:<br><br>
                1. Agricultural services on the lord's land: This includes plowing, sowing, harvesting crops and hay,
                threshing, and other
                similar tasks.<br><br>
                2. Transportation services for the lord: These include carting goods to the city, the forest, and to the
                manor.<br><br>
                3. Manual labor services: Such as work on the manor, in the garden, during hunting, fishing, and other
                activities.<br><br>
                Services imposed by the sovereign, which mainly pertain to public order, are not considered here.
                <br><br>
                In "modo præstationis," there is primarily, with regard to agricultural work, the difference that either
                the peasant is
                assigned a specific piece of land to cultivate without any determination of time, or the service is
                specified in days
                with so many horses and people, but the lord of the manor, or his steward



                <br> 99)<br>
                or tenant, applies the service where he sees fit. The latter seems to deserve preference; however, one
                should mainly
                adhere to the customary local method, but it would also be possible to establish the determination of
                services in either
                way on an equivalent basis and give the parties the choice. Whether the performance is to take place on
                the one or the
                other basis, a general ratio between the lord's land, in so far as it should be cultivated by the corvée
                labor, and the
                peasant land, in so far as its inhabitants are obligated to cultivate the former or to be used there,
                should first be
                established and indicated in the princely ordinance.<br><br>
                Regarding the other two main branches of corvée labor, one will quickly complete their regulation if one
                bases it on the
                distinction between the needs of agriculture and matters unrelated to agriculture. The maintenance of a
                rural residence
                for the lord of the manor and the farm buildings, the provision of firewood from the forest, and
                transport to the town



                <br> 100)<br>
                with crops to be sold are matters related to agriculture. Which ones are not, I need not say. The matter
                is most easily
                resolved if a general annual total of unpaid manual and draft labor is stipulated for these various
                matters concerning
                agriculture, without specific details, so that it is left to the lord of the manor to decide how to use
                the stipulated
                service. Additionally, a fair tariff should be set, according to which the lord of the manor, if he
                requires more of
                such services for his own and direct use — without excluding rural pleasures, hunting, and fishing — may
                expect payment
                from his peasants. If, on one hand, it is fair that the peasant should not be overburdened under
                numerous pretexts, and
                if it is generally advantageous for the state that he is not diverted from agriculture, his true
                calling, by side jobs,
                then, on the other hand, it is also not unreasonable to ensure modest pleasures for the lord of the
                manor and amenities
                that make his stay on the estate pleasant. What should be included in thisangenehm machen können, zu
                sorgen. Was dazu
                gerechnet werden




                <br> 101)<br>
                cannot be specifically stipulated, but if nothing is reserved, there is also the risk that the peasant
                becomes insolent
                and refuses everything that is not explicitly stipulated as an obligation, but should be an act of
                kindness. The best
                remedy is a tariff for such services; thus, the lord of the manor can enjoy his pleasures, but since it
                involves costs,
                he will not easily misuse them to oppress the peasants.

                    Taxes must be assessed in kind, not in money.

                </h2>
                With the presumed permission of my favorable reader, I would like to conclude this concern with two
                reminders.
                <br><br>
                The first is that one must always be careful not to evaluate payments that are determined or should be
                determined in
                kind in terms of money.

                <br><br>
                Namely, one must not set a permanent price for these payments. You can, if you wish, receive them in
                money, but
                according to the price of the commodity at any given time. Thus, the above-stated principles of taxes
                from a portion of
                the lord's land and a peasant farm should not be specified in money but according to a customary local
                measure of the
                crop that is the main product of each estate, or, to speak arithmetically, the unit for calculation
                should not be the
                customary local unit of currency (e.g., a thaler) but the customary local measure of agricultural
                produce (e.g., a
                barrel of rye), and it should be stipulated once and for all that this unit should each time be
                calculated in money
                according to the market price of the time.
                <br><br>
                In earlier, and not so very distant times, taxes were paid in kind,



                <br>103)<br>
                which is also natural, as the subject gives what he has, namely the products with which he is occupied
                in producing and
                gaining, and from this come the still-used names of the various units by which the taxes are calculated.
                <br><br>
                With increasing trade, which reduces all goods to money, the common measure of all goods, the same thing
                also happened
                increasingly with regard to taxes, to the advantage and convenience of both sides. For the government,
                the collection
                and all financial operations became infinitely easier, and the subject on his side retained the
                permission to sell his
                goods, which could easily be converted into money through trade, thereby choosing the most convenient
                and advantageous
                market.
                <br><br>
                That would be quite good if only the world circumstances to which trade is subject, and from whose
                influence no state
                can escape, were not so changeable, and if the total amount of circulating money remained in constant
                proportion to
                goods and industries, and if the measure of goods always remained the same. But that has not happened
                and will never
                happen in this sublunary world.

                David Hume, who in recent times has eagerly emphasized this not entirely new, but quite natural and
                easily agreeable
                reminder, has been contradicted in various ways, particularly by arguing that a hundred other factors
                interfere with
                price determination; but Hume can admit this and still be correct in the main point. It is not a
                consequence that if our
                supply of money were doubled overnight, all things would soon be twice as expensive, but an increase
                does occur wherever
                money accumulates; that is certain and undeniable.
                <br><br>
                Not only has the absolute quantity of precious metals accumulated in Europe in general since the
                discovery of America,
                and would have accumulated even more without in the least increasing prosperity in Europe, if it had not
                been partly
                exported again to India—something those who reject trade with India do not consider, because it must be
                conducted with
                silver, and they themselves do not know what they want with their pious sighs. Not only, I say, has the
                quantity of
                precious metals accumulated, and with it, the old measure of goods changed, but this change


                <br> 105)<br>
                in the measure has also been further driven by paper money and excessive circulation, to the
                considerable confusion of
                the world.

                <br><br>
                England's current difficulties, particularly regarding high prices—whose cause, as the authors of the
                Göttingische
                Gelehrten Anzeigen say, one searches for in vain in heaven and on earth—stem from this source. And
                because most European
                states, to a greater or lesser extent, are on the same path on which Great Britain has progressed
                further, I ask for
                permission for a slight digression, if indeed it is a digression in the context of the prevailing
                subject.<br><br>
                Everyone has the word "circulation" on their lips, and few consider the analogy. Just as surely as there
                is a
                circulation in the human body that one calls a fever, so surely there is a feverish circulation in the
                state. Only that
                circulation which arises from widespread trade and commerce in the state can be compared to the healthy
                warmth and
                circulation in the human body, and only that is healthy blood which has been processed along its proper
                paths in the
                body.





                <br> 106)<br>
                Who would induce a fever in a weak body to achieve stronger circulation, or fill it with foreign fluids
                when it seems to
                lack blood? No, one should simply strengthen the body and facilitate its functions, and its circulation
                will rise on its
                own, and it will start to produce healthy blood.
                <br><br>
                And just as surely as not all fluids in a human body must or should circulate, but rather that the
                separated fluids
                stored outside the paths of circulation give the body its fullness and good appearance, yet disappear
                again—and with
                them prosperity—when a violent fever melts them, or dropsy transforms them into a slimy liquid and thus
                puts them back
                into circulation, so not all money in a state must circulate, and even less should its remaining wealth
                be converted
                into money and circulated. Great Britain is in such a condition. Its national debts are sums that,
                without invigorating
                commerce, have come into circulation, whereas they should and would otherwise be a dormant asset. They
                annually take
                away four million pounds sterling in interest from the fruits of the land and industry,




                <br> 107)<br>
                and bring these also into circulation, as mentioned, without stimulating labor and industry, but rather
                to their
                detriment, by accumulating all the money in a few hands and making everything more expensive for
                most.<br><br>
                For a long time, complaints have been widespread from those living on fixed incomes, as it has become
                increasingly
                difficult for them to make ends meet; but nearly all governments are in the same situation. On the one
                hand, their needs
                have risen beyond the natural wealth of the states since the introduction of the standing army; on the
                other hand, their
                fixed revenues have been significantly reduced by the decrease in the value that money should have
                against all needs.<br><br>
                This inconvenience could have been foreseen, for it has long been noted, as mentioned, the gradual
                change in the general
                standard; but that is how it goes—theory almost always comes later, and now this problem, like other
                imperceptibly
                growing problems, has become so large that it is time to think about a fundamental remedy for it in
                financial science.<br><br>
                I leave this for now to the financiers, but I strongly advise against making the same mistake in




                <br>108)<br>
                the current matter, and not to harm future generations by any hasty determination of the products of the
                estates and the
                imposition of taxes in money. Whatever happens, it is always most natural to demand from the farmer what
                he has—the
                products of the land—and that is also the fairest from all sides. If it continues in the world as it has
                for a long
                time, with money losing its value in relation to the goods of the world, then the future owners of
                estates would have
                cause to complain about the present ones if they fixed the taxes in money during the planned change, and
                they would seek
                to overturn the constitution again. On the other hand, should the price of the country's products fall
                below the fixed
                tax rate, which is generally less likely but still possible under certain circumstances, the farmers
                would not be able
                to survive, and thus neither would the constitution.

                <h2>
                    Considerations regarding changes to the tax registers of estates and properties, once established
                    for the adjustment of
                    sovereign dues.

                </h2>
                My second remark concerns these considerations, and because one could easily be tempted to think of
                changing such tax
                registers in the context of an intended change in the constitution of the peasantry, I cannot help but
                advise against
                it.<br><br>
                1. Firstly, it seems to me that the timing of this undertaking is the most inconvenient for a change in
                the tax
                registers, and I suggest considering whether such a change, with the intention of improving the
                constitution of the
                peasantry, would not appear contradictory in the eyes of the public.
                <br><br>
                2. At any time, a new determination and evaluation of properties is a concerning step and cannot occur
                without
                revolutions in the fortunes of individuals. Everything in the state aligns itself with the levies. If
                these
                determinations, once introduced, are changed, it seems to most people that




                <br>110)<br>
                arise from it, a very troubling and unfortunate notion that can have very harmful consequences for any
                state. If this or
                that estate, this or that farm, seems to be assessed too low in consideration of its profitability, one
                must consider
                that perhaps its current owner has paid so much more for it precisely for that reason, or that it has
                been brought to
                its present flourishing state through the diligent efforts of its owners and significant beneficial
                investment. And if,
                on the other hand, another estate seems to be over-assessed, its owner may have acquired it so much
                cheaper, or perhaps
                it has become less profitable due to the fault of its owners. Perhaps what has happened, which is the
                case with most of
                these burdened properties, is that from time to time, plots of land have been sold off from one estate
                and added to
                others without being charged their proper pro-rata share of levies, which should never have been
                allowed. In general,
                however, whatever the case may be, the current circumstances are circumstances that everyone knows and
                acts upon; but
                government regulations that change all circumstances, yes, if one must fear them,



                <br>111)<br>
                "then one no longer knows what to rely upon," and consequently, many people will undoubtedly become
                disconcerted.<br><br>
                3. I am particularly concerned that the diligence in agriculture may be undermined at its source. Mere
                compulsion is a
                poor driving force for diligence and never takes it far, certainly never beyond the bounds of
                mediocrity. Quite
                differently works the drive for expanded prosperity, combined with the thought of being free and secure
                against
                objections. These drives and ways of thinking, like many other harmless types of opinions that do so
                much in the world
                and imperceptibly, like time, promote and thwart government measures, deserve, in my opinion, a
                government’s respect and
                consideration. I doubt that those who are inclined to think and say, "Why should we strive to improve
                our estates if it
                only results in new taxation for us?" will be appeased with the argument that most of the fruits of
                their labor will
                remain with them, even if the government demands a part of it. And I fear the reply would be that




                <br>112)<br>
                they would not only have to improve their estate through contemplation and speculation but also through
                considerable
                expenses, and that they would wish to know a limit to the taxation.
                <br><br>
                4. And in general, the establishment of a new land register is such a delicate matter and is so closely
                intertwined with
                the overall financial system that I hope it is never undertaken without prior consideration of the
                entire financial
                system (consideration based on theory and not mere routine).
