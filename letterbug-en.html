                Councilor Ryberg will have informed Your Esteemed what I wrote to him last Sunday. Since then, I have
                received a
                long-awaited letter from Count von Holmer dated 31 Dec., in which he states that "regarding the royal
                permission for
                Mr. Wessel, a ministerial note was sent 10 days ago from him (von Holmer) to the Royal Danish envoy
                Count von Moltke
                in Copenhagen, and he hopes we will soon receive a response."<br>
                Since Your Esteemed noted yourself that the contract between Mr. Wessel and me cannot be signed until
                the permission
                is received, the draft of the contract, which I sent to Eutin for further processing, is temporarily
                withheld and
                will be returned to you.<br>
                I will be informed immediately when Mr. Wessel returns from Norway to Copenhagen, and I repeat that it
                would be
                useful to be informed of his opinion regarding the residence here.<br>
                I thank Your Esteemed for the kindness in allowing us to borrow Your geographical instrument and
                ensuring that we do
                not encounter any difficulties. Your assistance with our entire matter will certainly not go unnoticed,
                and I ask
                for Your continued support.<br>
                Should it be necessary to pay Mr. Ahl for some of the ordered work already completed, to motivate him to
                complete
                the rest, I ask to be informed. Your Esteemed mentioned in the first letter which instruments are
                necessary for the
                triangulation observatory: now I ask for a note on what Mr. Ahl is currently working on and the cost of
                each part,
                both to plan the finances and to assess what should also be ordered for use by the surveyors from Mr.
                Ahl.<br>
                With wishes that the new year may be blessed, I remain with respect,<br>

                Esteemed
                Honorable Sir Professor<br>
                Through a response received with the last post from Eutin, I am authorized to enter into further
                negotiations with
                Your Esteemed regarding the surveyor Mr. Cimber. Also, the establishment of a small observatory for Mr.
                Wessel and
                the purchase of the clock and (…?) with stand, which Your Esteemed kindly offered, have been
                approved.<br>
                I therefore reiterate the request in my last letter to arrange the shipment of these two items before
                the (…?)
                sailing, as indicated via Kiel and Altona.<br>
                For the contract with Mr. Cimber, I enclose an appendix. Count von Holmer's excellency will
                ministerially secure
                royal permission. Should any difficulties arise from Mr. Cimber's side, I remember Mr. Wessel mentioned
                and praised
                a Mr. Johnson.<br>
                In anticipation of a prompt response, I remain with respect,<br>
                Your Esteemed

                </h2>
                As we continue to await the royal permission, no significant step can be taken in the matter with Mr.
                Wessel.
                Despite the kind intentions and persistent efforts of Your Esteemed, Mr. Professor! and from Mr. Count
                v. Holmer, I
                believe the entire matter will be abandoned. As long as it is not ministerially secured, I do not
                consider it
                proper, in Mr. Wessel's interest, to take further measures. The unpleasant situation Mr. Wessel finds
                himself in
                does not allow it, as it is dangerous for his health to remain here for an additional 8 weeks, so he
                plans, as he
                has informed you, to go to Norway. He may not be seen here again unless there is a change. What we can
                do in the
                current situation, without taking further action, is to request permission from Mr. Count von Moltke,
                and I cannot
                propose more than to present Your Esteemed with a draft and contract for kind review and signature, and
                then await a
                final decision on the entire matter, whereupon I await your commands while I hold myself back.<br>
                Finding another in Mr. Wessel's place will hardly be possible, and time does not allow it. Moreover, I
                have no
                instruction on it, and I do not consider it appropriate either. The recognized Mr. Cimber, whom I was
                recommended in
                this context, did not wish to be subordinate to the geodetic officer here, but only to act
                independently, and his
                approach would require a disproportionately large sum of money.<br>

                Esteemed
                Honorable Sir Professor!<br>
                Trusting in Your Esteemed continued friendly interest in our surveying work and Mr. Wessel's operations,
                I take the
                liberty to request a kind notice of Your observations of the lunar eclipse on 10 and 11 September and
                enclose Mr.
                Wessel's report of his observation. He also observed the immersion of two of Jupiter's moons on 16 and
                17 September
                but was prevented from observing the emersions on 23 and 27 due to illness, and hence does not mention
                these
                remarks.<br>
                I also request a kind notice of remarks regarding Jupiter's moons on the mentioned days.<br>
                According to Mr. Wessel's triangulation operations, the longitude of Bremen differs from that here by
                2´´20´´52´´´
                time: but as far as we know, no reliable value for Bremen has been indicated in any letter.<br>
                Oldenburg's latitude, according to Mr. Wessel's determination, is 53 08´ 23´´, and Bremen's (Ansgard
                Thum) 53 04´
                53´´ 04´´´.<br>
                I am very sorry, not only for our work but also out of true friendship for Mr. Wessel, that the brave
                man is a
                little ill and suffers from quartan fever, and not only he but also his wife. Otherwise, he has made
                good progress
                this summer.<br>
                I recommend myself and our work to Your continued friendly participation and remain with respect,<br>
                Your Esteemed

                <p>
                    I thank Your Esteemed on my own and Mr. Wessel's behalf for the provided information in Your
                    valuable letter of
                    27 Dec., and simultaneously request a kind notice of observations regarding the occultations of some
                    (…?) of the
                    moon mentioned in Mr. Wessel's enclosed memorandum.<br>
                    In his future observations, as he noted long ago, Mr. Wessel will also be motivated by Your Esteemed
                    admonition
                    to conduct measurements as well as such precise corresponding observation from Your observatory. We
                    assume that
                    the observations from Göttingen, which Mr. Wessel received, will also not be insignificant or
                    uninteresting to
                    him. We kindly request the return of Mr. Wessel's memorandum at your convenience. I now hope that
                    Mr. Wessel's
                    health condition and the weather will be favorable for his projects, and I have good hopes, as his
                    health has
                    significantly improved, and the fever only occasionally gives small symptoms, which the doctor
                    prefers to
                    tolerate rather than suppress the fever forcefully. His appearance has improved, and he has regained
                    energy and
                    strength to work.<br>
                    As one can often make a virtue out of necessity, it is also the case with our triangles, which we
                    must take as
                    they are due to the character of our land. This disadvantage of the short distances is compensated
                    by the
                    advantages that the triangulators are not hindered by high obstacles, as with large distances, which
                    were
                    impeded last summer by a strange dry haze. With the short distances, such obstacles do not stand in
                    the way, and
                    the work of the surveyors is supported accurately by the amount of trigonometrically determined
                    points. The
                    corrections are generally smaller than Mr. Wessel first feared, and the difficulties with the
                    results are
                    mitigated, especially also by the extensive chain of triangle series, by Mr. Wessel's great care. In
                    my eyes, it
                    is also an advantage that I can choose and mark entire triangle series in advance and thus pave the
                    way for the
                    triangulator, so he, without wasting time choosing points, can proceed directly with his
                    observations from point
                    to point.<br>
                    I recommend us and our work to Your continued kind participation and remain with respect,<br>

                    Most Noble, Highly Honored Mr. Justiciary and Professor!<br>
                    In order to use the determination of our meridian made by Mr. Wessel through two points, one being
                    the center of
                    our (…?…) improvised observatory, and the other approximately a mile away and marked by a stone
                    pillar, to, I
                    say, also use this meridian for the secondary purpose of regulating our city clocks, we would like
                    to have a
                    well-drawn horizontal sundial. When the observatory, which stands on a bastion of the wall, is torn
                    down, a
                    pillar with a marble plate on top should be erected in its center, in which a line pointing in the
                    direction of
                    the midday line is engraved, so that the clock, which will otherwise be stored in the nearby castle,
                    can be
                    taken and placed on the marble plate and, as often as necessary, check the accuracy of the public
                    clocks against
                    the true time indicated by the sundial.<br>

                    Mr. Ähl will hopefully be moved to make this clock according to the accompanying drawing by Mr.
                    Wessel and the
                    associated instructions, and also the valuable verbal instructions that Your Excellency will kindly
                    give him at
                    my request, in the specified size. He will also consider the usage and indicated circumstance that
                    the clock
                    should not remain in place but be set up and taken down as needed, and therefore give the brass
                    plate the
                    appropriate thickness and strength, and give the (…) serving (…) the necessary firmness, and give
                    the edge of
                    the hypotenuse, which indicates the shadow, the necessary sharpness, and also pack the whole clock
                    for shipment
                    in such a way that it cannot be damaged during transport, which unavoidably partly goes overland
                    from Kiel to
                    Altona.<br>

                    Mr. Conference Councilor Ryberg will have the kindness to handle the payment and the shipping,
                    assuming that he
                    does not have to deal with the packing, which is the responsibility of the craftsman. I ask Your
                    Excellency to
                    agree on the price with Mr. Ähl and to attest his bill. The making of the clock is not urgent, as
                    long as it is
                    in Altona before Michaelmas. Drawing and case will then be returned.<br>

                    Mr. Wessel has had much to do with the bothersome fever until this hour. Due to fog, the low
                    position of the
                    moon, and the sun being covered by it, not a single observation of multiple occultations has
                    succeeded
                    throughout the winter. Perhaps it will go better on May 6, where I do not know how such a threat, I
                    do not know
                    which (…?) will occur.<br>

                    If, as I hope, Mr. Ähl takes on the work, I also request that he be informed of the price through
                    Mr. C. R.
                    Ryberg; otherwise, please return the drawing and instructions with the case.<br>

                    I have the honor, with the recommendation of Mr. Wessel, to remain,<br>
                    With respect,<br>
                    Your Excellency's
                    most humble servant,<br>

                    Honorable Sir Professor<br>
                    The interest that Your Esteemed holds for our dear Mr. Wessel's local enterprise, and especially
                    also the common
                    benefit presented in the enclosed memorandum's proposal, leads me to have no doubt that Your
                    Esteemed will
                    recommend the imminent combination of the local triangulation center with that over there, and to
                    make
                    arrangements in the spring. Should Your Esteemed wish for ministerial support for the matter, I
                    kindly ask that
                    you inform me, as I will immediately do my best to secure it.<br>
                    I await with hope for a prompt reply, with respect,<br>
                    Your Esteemed
                    most humble servant<br>
                    Gl. Oeder<br>

                    Esteemed
                    Honorable Sir Professor!<br>
                    Through the post, I have received information that the observations our dear Mr. Wessel carried out
                    last year,
                    as well as the ongoing measurements, have now resumed. His long stay in Copenhagen is the cause of
                    the extensive
                    delays in the work, which we are very sorry about, but he is back and active again, and I hope that
                    our work
                    will now be able to continue with faster progress. I await with anticipation and joy the results and
                    observations that Mr. Wessel will present, and I am confident that his efforts will be of great
                    value to our
                    common goal. Should Your Esteemed have further requests or instructions regarding our work, I kindly
                    ask you to
                    inform me.<br>
                    With respect,<br>
                    Your Esteemed
                    most humble servant
                    Oeder<br>
                    Oldenburg 18 Feb. 1785.
