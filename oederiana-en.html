                    The last of the four brothers who passed away from Oeder was a man. He had, like every human being,
                    his often prominent
                    flaws. He was of strict moral principles. Great talents cannot be denied him by envy, nor by the
                    father and the other
                    three brothers. And — what anyone who has known him well must and will confirm, he was a loyal
                    subject, devoted to his
                    prince, and a — truly honest man. He was everything that Chamberlain Suhm has said about him to the

                            <b> I hate pen battles.</b> If one knows, the belletrists write calendar makers about
                            Lessing, how
                            much he sought truth, how
                            much he detested everything that blocked his path, how he despised people who sought to
                            imprison reason. Is it
                            surprising that he became involved in serious disputes? And has not each of them had a
                            beneficial impact on us? From his
                            conflict with Gottsched and Lange to his final dispute with Gözen, how much interesting,
                            useful, and fruitful material
                            have we gained from them! How many grains of truth, buried under rubble and stones, did he
                            uncover, purify, and present
                            with a smile? — A proof that pen battles can also have their uses. Atqui, ergo.

                            <b> Just as verbal quarrels.</b> These are very unpleasant and almost intolerable in the
                            company of
                            civilized men, especially
                            scholars, in worldly interactions. The author knew this from experience in his younger
                            years. How notorious were the
                            verbal and physical disputes among the Philanthropists throughout the entire Holy Roman
                            Empire. The Orthodox still place
                            great value on this hands-on teaching. It should rightly not be practiced. But how can it be
                            eradicated or punished? I
                            do not know. — With a competent strainer.

                            and yet
                            there is no remedy to
                            escape them, other than to steer them towards the truth, as Herr von Oeder did with great
                            composure — to heroically
                            admonish them.

                        knowledge, though not in
                        genius. Oeder only became a botanist in Norway, and Holm was forced to abandon his beloved
                        science, to which he had
                        dedicated his whole life, for another field he knew nothing about and first had to learn. Out of
                        frustration and
                        dejection, he fell ill before he could embark on his new journey, and he died as a martyr of the
                        nation on foreign soil
                        in the prime of his years.

                            answered by von Oeder. Oeder was
                            young, and apparently, Holm was even younger. Oeder had studied botany alongside other
                            medical sciences as a future

                            years? Is the noble young corporal the same as the general? Was Mr. Fabricius already the
                            man he is now when he left
                            Edinburgh? He should examine himself and confess. And is every scholar questioned and
                            utilized according to his favorite
                            study in the state? How many preachers would then refrain from entering the pulpit, and how
                            many advocates would gladly
                            avoid burdening the courtroom with all sorts of nonsense, yielding the battleground to the
                            miserable tongue-twisters? A
                            very unnatural and, given the pitiable state of affairs in the states, impossible demand
                            that Mr. Fabricius is making
                            here. However, that Mr. von Oeder was a botanist has been proven to all impartial Europe
                            with his Flora Danica, and this
                            same Europe has not overlooked his merits in botany.

                        Before I speak further with Mr. Fabricius as my former friend and advocate of the right of
                        indigeneity (for he attacks
                        me on the occasion of discussing indigeneity), I must contradict his account concerning the
                        facts. Anyone who reads what
                        Mr. Fabricius has written cannot help but think that Holm and I were rivals for the same
                        position and that he was
                        displaced because of me – perhaps even by me. None of these three assertions, however, is true.
                        We were never
                        competitors for the same position, and if it had not pleased King Frederick the Fifth to
                        establish a botanical
                        institution funded by his private chamber, with the admittedly (as the professor knows, through
                        whose fault it failed)
                        thwarted aim of later merging it with the university, and if it had not pleased the king to
                        commission a work on the
                        native plants of his European lands and to employ me for both of these undertakings, it does not
                        follow at all that the
                        late Holm would have been appointed for the same. For it is certain that, regarding both
                        projects, at least at court, at
                        the time the gracious king took me into his service, these plans were not even conceived.

                            <b> Facts. </b>If they are accepted as truths, which one cannot help but do, then the story
                            of this
                            attack is, to say the least,
                            rather poor.

                            been better informed.
                            However, Holm's fate and the interest intertwined with it ought to have been revealed more,
                            as the public is still far
                            too uninformed about these secret stories, even to this day. Both in the attack and in the
                            defense, there is thick
                            darkness, and Mr. Fabricius is now the only one who could shed light on this story if the
                            public, which I hardly
                            believe, should care about it. Both Holm and von Oeder rest.

                        Likewise, it does not follow at all that because only one path opened, which was not Holm's
                        path, such that we could not
                        meet on the same, he was thereby forced to abandon his favorite science, which, according to Mr.
                        Fabricius's words, he
                        had dedicated his life to (though it was still the life of a young man just beginning to find
                        his way in the world), to
                        exchange it for another. For within an entire monarchy, there is likely room enough in this
                        field for two, and nothing
                        prevented Holm's patrons from working on his behalf as well. Thirdly, I no longer precisely
                        remember the later fate of
                        the man, nor was I ever aware of his intentions and measures. However, I still clearly remember
                        that during the one
                        visit he granted me in his life, where he seemed willing to open his heart to me, it was, as
                        mentioned, easy for me to
                        demonstrate that it does not follow that if I had not held my position, he would have held it. I
                        recall quite well, as I
                        said, that I am not aware of having hindered anyone's progress but rather have supported more
                        than one, all of whom were
                        natives, in advancing their careers. Regarding the rest about myself, I respond, without
                        expecting Mr. Fabricius to
                        acknowledge my stance, only as information for our readers, that I was indeed a young man upon
                        entering the king's
                        service, who only truly made botany the main focus of my attention once it became my calling.

                        As unfounded as the attack is in fact, equally unexpected is its manner to me. For several years
                        I maintained a friendly
                        relationship with Mr. Fabricius and his honorable late father, and I am not aware of having
                        given him cause to break off
                        our friendship. He knows that I, just as reluctantly as I was drawn away from botany, was
                        equally reluctant to leave
                        Denmark entirely, which I considered my second homeland, having spent over twenty years, the
                        better half of my life
                        until that point, in its service. And I continue to wish all the best for the state where I
                        enjoyed so much good,
                        certainly not because I am no longer in its employ. Likewise, I flatter myself to still be held
                        in good memory among the
                        many honorable residents whom I was fortunate to call friends. Mr. Fabricius and I agree on
                        principles regarding
                        population, and before him, I have in a known, printed, and now reprinted work on freedom and
                        property within the
                        peasant class, and in business generally, ardently written in favor of proper freedom in trade
                        and movement. He knows
                        that, following the 1769 census and per an official order and calling, I expressed my views on
                        the population of Denmark
                        and its associated states. So what moves him to attack? The only plausible reason that remains
                        is that Mr. Fabricius, as
                        an advocate of the right of indigeneity, has believed it necessary to cast a sour look and an
                        unfriendly word after a
                        man who has ceased to be a royal servant. Certainly without considering that such an unprovoked
                        and thus willful attack
                        on one transferred to the service of another friendly prince, in the company of so many
                        honorable men and servants of
                        the king, would not be well-received.

                            <b> Dissolution of Friendship. </b>Perhaps the entire attack by the professor on Oeder and
                            other
                            upright men was nothing more
                            than a whim. At that time, I would have said to Mr. Oeder: Why would you want to separate
                            from good company? Just stay
                            with them. We’re all on the same path. Mr. Fabricius insists on it.

                            <b> On being withdrawn from botany.</b> The professor knows best about this. The Danish
                            author of a
                            biography of Struensee has a
                            different opinion, pages 41–42. The finance councilor necessarily had to go down a
                            completely different path than the
                            botanist. Events proved it.

                            <b> Leaving Denmark altogether. </b>That seems very believable, and I am convinced of this
                            truth.
                            But why could things not have
                            been brought into a better state after Struensee’s fall? Certainly, this is a question that
                            only Mr. Oeder could have
                            answered. Enough—it’s certain that among everything he proposed under Struensee’s ministry,
                            and afterwards, until he
                            left office, there were no vague, but true, substantial, and beneficial projects. Among all
                            these stories, it
                            particularly struck me that the one person who enjoyed the most trust from the unfortunate
                            minister was, among all his
                            clients from the ruinous faction, the only one spared—a very remarkable case!
                            <br><br>
                            <b> To wish again for the good.</b> This is commendable and noble. Yet, Mr. Oeder owed his
                            future
                            well-being to the state he
                            left with great reluctance, and so, with every other good person whose fate was decided in
                            those times when a bitter
                            faction held sway, he should have thought—perhaps he did: Ubi bene ibi patria ("Where it is
                            good, there is my country").
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Legacy.</b> This is somewhat debatable. It may or may not be. I will not and cannot
                            investigate
                            this matter. I do believe,
                            however, that Oeder left friends behind. At least the chamberlain von Suhm, to the shame of
                            those who sent him almost as
                            if to Tomis across the Elbe, has done him justice.

                            <b> Commerce and Trade.</b> Iusti also hinted at this as early as 1757, if I’m not mistaken,
                            but he
                            was soon sent back home,
                            where he came from. Thus, the true key to why so many worthy and talented royal servants
                            were displaced in those times
                            must still await future generations. Meanwhile, these kinds of outbursts, like this one, are
                            surely unwelcome.

                        Mr. Fabricius states in his preface on p. 8 that he has sought to choose the examples of persons
                        and matters mentioned
                        so that they indeed illustrate the topic but without causing harm or discomfort to anyone. On p.

                            <b> Cited.</b> The coryphaeus of letter reporting is supposed to be named St. Germain. I
                            will remain
                            with him alone; others may
                            be guessed and understood by others. Of this man, I will only say this:
                            That Count St. Germain was a deserving, if not great, general, the whole world will admit to
                            me, and his last scene in
                            France should have convinced the entire world that he was a man of merit. When he entered
                            Danish service, Denmark had a
                            formidable enemy to expect. Why did the state believe it necessary to have a foreign
                            general? The army already had
                            generals. But it was evidently considered necessary to entrust the supreme command of an
                            army that had seen no action
                            for so many years to a foreigner. Did even one of the existing generals complain about this
                            or become dissatisfied? Why,
                            then, would one disparage a deserving man after his death as highly dispensable? How can a
                            scholar sitting in his study
                            even begin to judge a general? Here I consider the Count of St. Germain purely as a general.
                            That he was a worthy and
                            brave commander can be proven by the testimony of more than one general who gladly served
                            under him. And who here would
                            not praise the sophist of Ephesus and Carthaginian Hannibal?
                            In what ways he may have contributed little or nothing to the improvement of the state in
                            peacetime is another question
                            entirely. Suffice it to say, as a general, he does not deserve such direct censure
                            pronounced from the pulpit. And
                            similarly, the hundred foreign subjects already mentioned, and kept in mind, could well be
                            defended.

                        abide by it. But if the
                        king, like Frederick the Fifth, considers it wise to allow competition from foreigners and opens
                        his arms to them, he
                        grants them the rights of natives, which can only be withdrawn through punishable conduct if
                        they are found guilty of
                        such.

                        Therefore, their existence as subjects and servants should not be begrudged, and still less
                        should their loyalty,
                        integrity, and sense of duty toward the state, which has accepted them and become their second
                        homeland, be called into
                        question. When every position attained by a foreigner is complained about as if it were a theft,
                        when the question is
                        raised in each case whether the position might not have been better filled by a native, this
                        language in the mouth and
                        pen of a native is not patriotism but envy and a spirit of persecution. The foreigner may lament
                        his position, but
                        should also say to the native: do not argue with me, but with the king; and who among Danes
                        could bring themselves to
                        argue with Frederick V in his grave?

                            <b> Against Foreigners.</b> The best admonition in the world, if only Professor Fabricius
                            would heed
                            it. However, if this way of
                            thinking—which, for almost 20 years now, has become, one might say, a fashionable way of
                            thinking concerning
                            foreigners—should still persist, as it has not diminished, then in later generations,
                            particular consequences may arise.
                            What benefit can there be in the world from pitting subjects against fellow subjects, making
                            them contemptuous of,
                            embittered against, or distrustful of each other? I am not the only one who thinks this way;
                            Mayor Bruyn in Schleswig
                            shares this view. See his remarks on p. 15.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Government.</b> The professor is truly rather harsh and unmerciful with foreigners, whom
                            Moses
                            tolerated among his people.
                            Why? I would really like to know. His language is not patriotism. What is it, then? Let
                            impartial Danes answer this
                            anew. I would seem biased if I tried to defend every former foreigner who was solemnly
                            granted the rights of natives.
                            However, Professor, why, in these very times, have we called Mr. von Schirach, Mr. Bergrat
                            Abich, and others back from
                            abroad into the kingdom? Couldn’t even more be called? This would surely be possible.

                            But for heaven’s sake, should
                            Denmark be the only nation in the civilized world to detest everything called “foreign”? The
                            recently deceased Count von
                            Schimmelmann, Count von Bernstorff, General Huth, and so many other meritorious men in
                            Danish service are not natives.
                            Are all these men harmful to the state? Not a word more.

                            The state must also extend justice to foreigners. Has the monarchy at no time had malicious
                            natives? There are surely
                            still enough to be found. I don’t wish to dwell on details, otherwise—but on this point, the
                            impartial, non-native
                            Danish subject rightly observes a deep silence. He does not wish to fan the flames but far
                            prefers to extinguish them.

                            not doubt the loyalty of a
                            foreigner whom your own fundamental law has made a native. Love your foreign neighbor; he
                            will gladly make it his duty
                            to love you again as his brother with all his heart.

                        This injustice, of which I speak, is something Mr. Fabricius has fully committed in his writing.
                        Holm, he says, had to
                        yield to Oeder, meaning: Oeder, as a foreigner, should have had no position at all—for, as
                        stated above, we—Holm and
                        I—were not competitors.

                        Mr. D. Cramer, says Mr. Fabricius, can perhaps still be accepted as prochancellor of the
                        university, but according to
                        Mr. Fabricius, he is perhaps the only one who has treated the nation justly, and who, out of
                        love and gratitude to a
                        nation that appreciated him, genuinely sought to familiarize himself with it and to highlight
                        its positive qualities.
                        The others (p. 80) looked down on every native as though they were half-Greenlanders, speaking
                        and writing in foreign
                        languages.

                            of the

                            still can; von Oeder has been,
                            or rather, could have done so. The public, to this day, knows nothing of the whole story and
                            its context. Even the
                            defense provided by Professor Fabricius in the preface to the first part of his
                            Polizey-Schriften has, at least for me,
                            not sufficiently clarified this story.

                            friendly evening together. I
                            gained Danish friends whom I could readily name, who later showed me more courtesy than some
                            of my own countrymen, to
                            whom I had rendered quite genuine services during my stay. I do not write as a hypocrite; I

                        more power than I
                        desired, and how I subsequently used it in a manner that was honored with high praise. Mr.
                        Fabricius, if he considers it

                        been a little less grand,

                            refutes in one stroke the lamentable outcry over this poet, otherwise loved by everyone who
                            is somewhat familiar with
                            the native language. Ewald, however, was unfortunate by his own doing. He was, as the entire

                            Günther; nonetheless, he was always a genius. It was told in Copenhagen that, in his
                            sickbed, even amid the most
                            intense, persistent pain, he could not let go of the thought that he was an image of
                            eternity because his twisted and
                            shrunken body nearly formed a circle.

                            far from them and, even if he had wished it, could not harm them? That would indeed be quite
                            incomprehensible.

                        achieved the level of
                        Schäfer. Regarding E., I might well ask Mr. Fabricius if it is Klopstock’s fault that Ewald, who
                        attained fame and
                        recognition long after Klopstock, did not also receive a pension? Could not further funds flow
                        from the same source? And
                        has Mr. Fabricius thought through where his tirade ultimately leads?
                        <br><br>
                        Mr. Fabricius states on pp. 80 and 81 that our scholars must necessarily lose heart, and our
                        geniuses be oppressed when
                        they see all foreigners basking exclusively in the minister's sunshine. Mr. Fabricius speaks in
                        the singular and does
                        not name names. I will be fully explicit and not only mention B. and M., but also two ministers
                        whom he may mean: the
                        late Count von Bernstorff and the still-living Count von Moltke. Both held great influence under
                        Frederick V., and the
                        monarch regarded them as friends, just as they were friends with each other. Concerning
                        Bernstorff, I still have a few
                        more words to say. As for the still-living Moltke, I leave it to him to respond to Mr.
                        Fabricius, or, if the Count finds
                        it unnecessary, I leave Mr. Fabricius to account for himself to the Count. But in the names of
                        both ministers, I fully
                        and emphatically refute the bold expressions of Mr. Professor Fabricius.

                            <b> Where is his tirade leading? </b>A Vestris makes, before one even realizes, a leap, a
                            sidestep,
                            or a counter-jump. A scholar
                            inflamed by patriotism also performs a pirouette or something similar.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Our Scholars.</b> I did not notice this in my travels, and all those mentioned by Prof.
                            Fabricius on p. 83, among them Gram,
                            Holberg, Ancher, the von Hoffmann brothers, Erici, Carstens, Müller, and several others who
                            should not be forgotten,
                            have always been appreciated and highly respected by foreigners familiar to some extent with
                            Latin and the national
                            language. This respect persists to this day. Only the stubbornness and fanciful partisanship
                            of a small number of
                            eccentrics now deny these indisputable truths.
                            Who among German literary scholars has denied the Danish poets Tullin, Wessel, Ewald, and,
                            in recent days, the entirely
                            new poet Bagge? Has not the latter’s charming Danish poems already been translated into the
                            German Musen-Almanach? Has
                            not even Miss Biel’s plays, as well as the late Dr. Bastholm’s sermons, been translated into
                            German? What more can one
                            demand, what more can one ask of this nation?
                            Should they revere every Danish pamphleteer, whose scribblings are hardly read beyond the
                            Colde Valley, while they
                            disregard their own pamphleteers?

                            <b> Bernstorff and Moltke.</b> The still-living Count Moltke may respond to the professor's
                            attack
                            as he sees fit. He seems to
                            have played Uncle Toby with the fly. The late Count’s reputation will neither be destroyed
                            by the professor nor by the
                            cleric Clausen of Tonslet on the Isle of Als. The latter’s pamphlet has long been forgotten,
                            and may it rest with him.

                            <b> The Colonial Project.</b> I am surprised that Mr. von Oeder did not mention the
                            well-known work
                            that Ludwig von Hess
                            published as Count Bernstorff’s personal defense. This work thoroughly and decisively
                            refutes all the accusations made
                            by Count Danoeskiold, who, being reliably weak and agitated by intrigue at the time, sought
                            to burden Count Bernstorff
                            with responsibility for the colonial matter. I would only wish that the professor, who,
                            along with others, asserts so
                            confidently that Count Bernstorff was solely responsible for this failed project and its
                            instigation, could also prove
                            it.
                            In my view, the reasons for the colonial failure are still buried in the darkness of
                            Tartarus, and a clear light will
                            never shine on them. I have seen glimpses of light, but not nearly enough to say more about
                            it. How is it even possible,
                            in the light of sound reason, to maintain such views about Count Bernstorff? I have always
                            found it incomprehensible.
                            But if someone chooses not to see, what can be said against it? That is also the case here.
                            Count Bernstorff is
                            supposed, once and for all, to be the scapegoat. Yet he is, once and for all, not one.

                        And now a promised word on Bernstorff, my special benefactor, whom I therefore have no desire to
                        extol unnecessarily.
                        First, Mr. Fabricius offers a deep bow on p. 79: the good, the honorable, the gentle Bernstorff.
                        P. 58: The colony
                        project was truly worthy of the great minister who first proposed it. And then he says: Even
                        Bernstorff was only great
                        so long as he worked in the foreign department. As soon as he engaged with the internal affairs
                        of the country and the
                        livelihood of its inhabitants, he was always unfortunate. It was natural. He knew neither the
                        land nor its livelihood
                        and therefore had to rely on others, who perhaps did not think as honestly as he did.
                        <br><br>
                        How can Mr. Fabricius, in a work where he rightfully preaches the necessity of freedom and
                        property within the peasantry
                        to improve and populate the state, fail to mention the example Bernstorff set on his estate of
                        the same name? And in
                        general, Mr. Fabricius, the zealous champion of the peasantry, who so boldly says on p. 78: —
                        "We have seen foreigners
                        as heads of most of our nation’s departments, and Denmark especially owes them a part of its
                        current weakness," — he
                        should ask himself, and publicly if he dares: Who is responsible for the impediments to the
                        constitution and improvement
                        of the peasantry in Denmark? Foreigners or natives?
                        <br><br>
                        According to Mr. Fabricius, Bernstorff neither knew the country nor its economy. Should
                        Bernstorff not have learned to
                        know what he spent so much energy trying to understand? I can personally testify that he
                        encouraged me to pay special
                        attention to the livelihood of Norway and directed me for several years towards involvement in
                        the economic affairs of
                        the land without departing from my botanical career. Even at his departure, he was working on my
                        transition to a new
                        career, as those who know the true circumstances of my path well know.
                        <br><br>
                        As a witness to part of the events and the concerns the honorable man went through, I might
                        remind you that he did not
                        take care to separate his part from others' contributions in such affairs but let himself be
                        overly pleased that
                        everything was credited to him. But indeed, the gentle Bernstorff, as Mr. Fabricius rightly
                        calls him, thought little
                        that one day such accusations would be made against his memory, as Mr. Fabricius now does.
                        <br><br>
                        Bernstorff, says Mr. Fabricius, was always unfortunate as soon as he engaged in the internal
                        affairs of the country and
                        the livelihood of its people. Has Mr. Fabricius, as he so boldly wrote this claim, considered
                        the significant change in
                        trade with the Danish West Indies, facilitated by releasing it through the dissolution of the
                        company? The promotion of
                        shipping in the Mediterranean and all other freight trade? The exemplary Frederik's Hospital?
                        The educational
                        institutions specifically directed toward the livelihood of the people? And these and many other
                        measures and
                        institutions that he, as a citizen of the state, namely Copenhagen, should have known about and
                        as a professor of
                        economics should have known, arise wholly or partially from Bernstorff and his distinguished
                        collaborators.<br><br>

                            <b> Unhappy in every way.</b> This has been very thoroughly refuted by von Oeder and Mayor
                            Bruyn on
                            p. 190 and following. I
                            shall therefore say nothing further about this point but let it pass.
                            <br><br>
                            <b> Foreigners as Leaders.</b> This must be proven much better. The following thoughts
                            against
                            foreigners are universally
                            insulting. Yet—accusing is far easier than proving.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Denmark's Part of Its Icy Weakness.</b> It is quite easy to throw such a thought onto
                            paper, but
                            proving it fully would
                            likely be quite difficult. Anyone who wishes to properly assess the ministers and heads of
                            the colleges from the death
                            of Frederick IV to our days will not see Denmark’s weakness under its leadership as a
                            result. However, if all misfortune
                            is to be attributed once and for all to foreigners, then one is evidently, in the highest
                            degree unjust, or one cannot,
                            again in the highest degree, see. Who can therefore refute such unfounded statements? The
                            professor may, if he only
                            thinks seriously, judge for himself in what error he has fallen by tossing this idea onto
                            paper along with several
                            others that he will never be able to prove.

                            <b> On the Obstacles to Improving the Peasant Situation.</b> Why did Professor Oeder not
                            engage with
                            this entirely reasonable
                            demand, either then or in any of his subsequent writings? There is still time. Who is still
                            seeking in modern times to
                            hinder the freedom and property of the peasants throughout the realm? Why not cast a stone
                            at the ingrained sinner as
                            well? To be partisan and only wish to suppress does not mean to spread light.

                            <b> Neither the Land nor the Food Situation. </b>Knowledge of the food situation in the
                            country has
                            certainly been written about
                            by many, as here, and how would it appear if one were to be exactly informed according to
                            the author’s own knowledge? It
                            is neither the right place nor the right time for me to delve into this matter in detail
                            here. I would only wish that
                            Professor Oeder would strictly answer me this one question: In which towns of the realm can
                            one observe a flourishing
                            food situation, and why does the decline of the food situation already manifest itself in
                            some towns of the duchies?
                            Haderslev, for example, is no longer the town it was thirty years ago when frigates built in
                            its harbor attracted the
                            curiosity of Peter the Great. Where does this come from? Whoever can explain this to me,
                            erit mihi Magnus Apollo (may he
                            be my great Apollo) regarding the food situation in Norway. There is indeed much to be said
                            about this matter. It always
                            seems to me
                            that certain outdated and in modern times reasonably no longer applicable political
                            principles have stood in the way of
                            the improvement of the food situation in Norway, in favor of others that are quite incorrect
                            but advantageous for a
                            certain kind of people. Lifting them has, according to public reports, made a fortunate
                            beginning with the Crown Prince,
                            and the continuation of these improvements is to be wished for.
                            A dark murmur from the ever-busy lady Fama might, of course, know secretively about the
                            world that the Councillor
                            Mortefeld has become sad about the obstacles to improving the food situation in Norway,
                            Elias, and about the improvement
                            of Iceland. What a Norwegian can achieve is told by Professor Fabricius himself in his
                            travels to Norway on p. 276 when
                            he provides news about the industrious and highly respected Niels Justensen, who is also
                            honored by the Agricultural
                            Society. He has, in a word, acquired his own estate solely through his diligence, where he
                            can harvest over 100 tons of
                            grain in addition to the livestock he keeps, which is a very large amount in this area. The
                            patriotic Count von
                            Schmettow wrote about the year 1764, when he was the commanding general in Norway, to
                            someone: "I must confess that I do
                            not believe there is a better land than Norway in the world. There are areas here where many
                            a farmer alternates sowing
                            corn, barley, or oats for 15 to 20 years without allowing the land to rest for a single
                            year, and some fertilize it more
                            than once. There is much to be done here if only the common man were a bit more diligent,
                            and if those appointed to him
                            had more regard for the common good, etc." The Chamberlains and officials of Adler and
                            Moltke, as well as Chamberlain
                            von Löwenschiold, will, as I hope, also in this realm contribute to the benefit of the Crown
                            and the state along with
                            the industrious Niels Justensen and others of his kind, following the blessed beginning of
                            improving the food situation
                            in Norway. Von Oeder, and even the professor himself, have both not concealed this matter
                            and their opinion on it as men
                            and patriots. However, whether both gentlemen deserve great thanks for certain Norwegian
                            towns cannot be further
                            investigated. At least von Oeder declined to become the district commissioner of Bergen,
                            even though he accepted
                            Trondheim, wisely so. Meanwhile, the depopulation of Finnmark and the northern regions,
                            compared to the population in
                            the mid-centuries and so on, still remains a striking contrast.

                            <b> The Concern of the Righteous Man. </b>As it seems to me, I will leave the judgment to
                            the
                            reader; thus everything from von
                            Oeder has been said here, certainly somewhat dark and hidden, that can be said in defense of
                            Count Bernstorff as an
                            apology, concisely and succinctly stated. One sees, as soon as one knows that von Oeder
                            truly held the minister’s trust
                            to a considerable degree in recent years, that he was scarcely guilty of the failed colonial
                            project or of other more
                            failed enterprises, but that he, because he truly was the gentle yet magnanimous Bernstorff,
                            did not want to divert
                            these matters, which were far weaker but equally powerful friends, away from him with much
                            fuss. It would be reasonable
                            not to disturb the ashes of this well-deserved minister of Denmark but, as would be proper,
                            to honor them without
                            exception.

                            <b> Conference Councilor Fleischer.</b> From the sound of the name, Mr. Conference Councilor
                            Fleischer is originally of German
                            descent, as is indicated in the Kiel Magazine for History. In the second part of the first
                            volume, in the essay:
                            Information about the Kongsberg Silver Mine, a councilor Fleischer is mentioned and is taken
                            to be a Saxon, but one who
                            remained in Denmark and settled there. Whether Mr. Conference Councilor descends from this
                            presumably remained councilor
                            in Norway, he will best know; I only thought it appropriate to mention this discovery in
                            passing as relevant to the
                            matter.

                        well known, and rumor has it that, as earnest as his promises may have been—those he made on
                        paper about abolishing
                        manor estates and introducing freedom and ownership—yet when he was offered a large estate as a

                        with the sole condition that he implement his plan there at his own expense, he did not dare to

                        sums accruing interest, and
                        yet he did not dare to attempt this himself on an estate gifted to him free of charge.

                            The reader may forgive me this small digression, which must justify my future thoughts in
                            pursuit of the proper
                            justification of Mr. von Oeder.
                            <br><br>
                            Since the revolution of 1772, a party of people has particularly emerged among the writers,
                            or rather scribblers, who
                            immediately consider anyone who does not wish to fantasize according to their imagination as
                            an extraneous and useless
                            member in Denmark, much like the Christ's vicar on Earth regards those who do not want to
                            kiss his slipper as worthy
                            heretics deserving of the fire. Anyone who has had the opportunity to seek and find the way
                            of thinking of those men,
                            who were in a sense, perhaps not willingly, the original source of this phantom, will regard
                            this party spirit not as a
                            wonder, but as a common meteor, patiently waiting for its disappearance. He can, he may
                            hope.
                            <br><br>
                            Above all, I must remind my readers of what von Oeder himself also says. I will quote his
                            own words. As he writes in the
                            appeal on p. 215, the entire outcome would likely have remained unknown to me if it were not
                            for foreigners among the
                            Danish public, whom I respect in this public as they do me, and I therefore acknowledge
                            their kind care with gratitude,
                            having informed me of it. If von Oeder, as can be seen here, did not still have unprejudiced
                            friends who did not know
                            how to appreciate his merits in Denmark, as they should have, he would have fared with this
                            writing just as with many
                            other Danish pamphlets and libels from the local mischievous Lucile, stans pede in uno. He
                            would not have been aware of
                            them; for aside from the life story written by the councilor himself, as far as I know, his
                            other writings have not
                            become further known in Germany. Thus, the German, and understood by the Germans, von Oeder
                            would, without being able to
                            defend himself, have been one-sidedly condemned by the readers of the councilor's writing
                            and found guilty without
                            rescue like Atahualpa before his Spanish judges. And so it goes, as I will soon show, with
                            the whole host of unnecessary
                            foreigners, which have once emerged from the magic lantern of Denmark, who, if sought, could
                            be found nowhere.

                        Just as the entire incident would presumably have remained unknown to me had not friends within
                        the Danish public, who
                        value my standing in this public as dearly as I certainly do myself — for which I gratefully

                        mentioned public, in full trust of its fairness, without taking up my pen, if it were not

                            The Lord Chamberlain Suhm, certainly a notable patriot, has rendered complete justice to the
                            deceased von Oeder as a
                            convinced friend of his merits and talents, as is fitting, and men who think rightly and are

                            will think the same as he. But I wish to mention just a few more writings of this sort,
                            which cannot sufficiently inform
                            their countrymen about this specter, pretending and misleading them; I will name just two
                            authors who can suitably be
                            compared to the enraged in France in their manner. The first is a periodical publication
                            adorned with a rather
                            dishonorable vignette, titled "Rigsdaler Sedlens Haendelser," published in Copenhagen in
                            1789. The second:
                            "Maanedsskriftet Kiöbenhavns Skilderie," published in Copenhagen in 1788.

                        baseless falsehood, and I make this declaration with an appeal to the high royal ministry, to

                            Both writings are imitations. The first imitates the English publication of events in
                            Guinea; the second follows the
                            "Tableau de Paris." To what extent these authors may match their models will have to be
                            taught by time. I do not foresee
                            much good. The young Laps, the sanctimonious administrator, and some other previously
                            mentioned characters may be read,
                            but they do not at all match the characters of their model, and to find a Danish Mercier
                            among the author of the
                            "Skilderie" would be even harder to assert. In both writings, however, the Germans are
                            depicted with the colors that
                            only an absurd, exaggerated hatred can impose. Denmark is portrayed as being flooded by
                            foreigners, particularly
                            Germans, as if by an Egyptian plague. There is even a map included to illustrate the
                            phantom, showing how the foreigners
                            press into the land of Goshen, just as the Spanish adventurers once surged into the New
                            World. Yes, I may not be wrong
                            to say that the ridiculous hatred even attacks the esteemed indigenous poet Bagge in Denmark
                            as well as abroad, calling
                            him the Germanizing Bagge. Thus, does von Oeder not rightly point out in the expression of
                            Herr Conferenzrath
                            Fleischer—one knew the Germans—what nonsense. How indecent, worthy of a Bavus and Maevius,
                            the writing style in these
                            writings is, in which all proof is lacking and which only breathe hatred, I will not seek to
                            elaborate further here, as
                            I must be brief.

                            It should be enough for me to simply say about the writers, as well as about Herr
                            Conferenzrath, that they lack all
                            proof; that they merely display a ghost from the magic lantern to their countrymen with the
                            exclamation: Beautiful
                            rarity! That their writings, written with such self-love, will only be read along the
                            present shores of the Coldinger
                            and Nipsaue; that they reveal their quite tiny world knowledge almost on every page; that
                            they only make their
                            unprovoked countrymen—a nation that has never offended them—innocently hated, lead them into
                            a harmful delusion, and
                            create not the slightest benefit, except perhaps for themselves, through the entire, one
                            would believe, bought empty
                            noise. That is all that can be said about these and many other much smaller scribblers of
                            their kind. The same applies
                            to the many writings with which Herr Conferenzrath has blessed us from his
                            "Acker-Catechismus," which even Danish
                            countrymen, to whom he has given it out of good intention from a German for their
                            instruction, have found no particular
                            taste in, according to their opinion, but have discovered much that they did not wish to
                            practice. Such writings are not
                            known abroad, and their industrious authors believe, because they naturally anticipate no
                            refutation or critique, that
                            they may, like Herr Conferenzrath here, trust such things to paper, quicquid in buccam
                            venit, and boast like Thraso.

                            The Herr Stifts-Amtmann von Oeder himself, prompted by friendly Danes, declares the
                            statement about the Germans, with
                            full justification, to be a Lucianic true story. Moreover, as far as I know, Herr
                            Conferenzrath has allowed the appeal
                            of Herr von Oeder, both in Danish and German, to remain with the public for judgment. The
                            same applies to his
                            associates, whose mischievous, untruthful, and often very dull mockeries that insult an
                            entire respectable nation, even

                            coarse wit, read this entire
                            story for their further enlightenment in the new Dunciade, for their much-needed
                            improvement. They too deserve the

                        rather peculiar expression
                        of a "Danish-thinking public" and no doubt intends it as a compliment. We may indeed name a
                        particular audience after
                        the place of residence of those who comprise it, particularly when referring to certain local
                        matters, about which one

                        reasonable audience around the world and does not allow for local differences. Thus, my appeal

                        reasonable public in Denmark, whose approval is valuable to me—a former resident of Denmark, who
                        long regarded it as his
                        second homeland, and whose departure can likely be attributed to his fervent defense of truths
                        now subjected to such a
                        solemn examination. To a public, I say, whose approval is of great worth to me, and to whom I
                        offer my sincere respect,
                        conscious that I count no small number of honorable individuals among its members as friends,
                        which outweighs many

                            <b>Danish-thinking public.</b> In advance, so that I do not fall into the same error as Herr
                            Conferenzrath and his companions,
                            I declare that I have never, ever, when speaking of the specific language used by him and
                            his companions, referred to
                            the entire Danish nation as he and they have, but rather only to those Danes who constantly
                            speak and write scornfully
                            of the entire German nation, which they do not know at all. I present them in my viewpoint
                            here as I write down my
                            explanation of what it means to think Danish and what it should truly say, leaving it to the
                            reader's judgment. Only to
                            him and his companions, not to the respectable nation of which I am a native and almost
                            fifty-year resident, do I try to
                            present my truths without further embellishment.
                            <br><br>
                            What Herr Conferenzrath seems to mean by "Danish thinking," in my view, can be explained
                            quite naturally by a recent
                            experience of mine.
                            <br><br>
                            I live quite isolated, and my contact with my Danish neighbors is somewhat limited because
                            my age, health, and personal
                            disposition do not make frequent visits very convenient. Be that as it may, it so happened
                            that I recently rented a
                            young boy from a nearby village for field work over the summer. The lady from the capital
                            who recently arrived at the
                            local vicarage heard of this and said to the boy who had just done her a favor, "What are
                            you doing with those people?
                            They are just German folk. How good can you have it with them?" When she was later told that
                            not only the boy but also
                            the other servants were entirely content with the German folk, her response, with a noble
                            toss of her head, was reported
                            to be: "Hm! I will go to those people myself and see what sort of folk they are." Now, this
                            young, beautiful woman—cast
                            upon the wide Jutland heath and by all appearances (for her language betrays her) of a very
                            sophisticated nature—wishes
                            to bring fortune upon my humble home, albeit uninvited. Since this loving threat was made, I
                            prepare each day to offer a
                            humble “bacio le mani.”
                            <br><br>
                            But I am inclined to believe that this not-insignificant, though raised-in-the-capital, lady
                            pastor—like other similar
                            sisters scattered throughout the provinces, whom I have met on my travels—believes she is
                            visiting a Polish dancing bear
                            before she actually meets a German man. The language this lady pastor and her otherwise
                            gallant associates use seems to
                            me to embody precisely what Herr Conferenzrath Fleischer and other writers like him call
                            "Danish thinking." Without any
                            rebuttal, let it be said: fishwives are not found only in Paris. Thus speaks the lady
                            pastor, with all the sisters of
                            her hall. Thus writes Herr Conferenzrath with his companions.
                            <br><br>
                            But of course, such things can be expected from a writer who addresses his audience with the

                            could assume such an audience would have special knowledge. But the manner of thinking is
                            the same among every
                            reasonable audience around the world and does not allow for local differences. Thus, my
                            appeal is directed at the
                            reasonable public in Denmark, whose approval is valuable to me—a former resident of Denmark,
                            who long regarded it as his
                            second homeland, and whose departure can likely be attributed to his fervent defense of
                            truths now subjected to such a
                            solemn examination. To a public, I say, whose approval is of great worth to me, and to whom
                            I offer my sincere respect,
                            conscious that I count no small number of honorable individuals among its members as
                            friends, which outweighs many
                            adversities.

                        nation, or any nation for
                        that matter, into an insult! This serves only to degrade oneself to the level of the common
                        rabble among the Danish
                        nation, where such outbursts, alas, are known to be proverbial.

                        property rights, as far as
                        possible, in Denmark. And from you, my friends in the Danish public, even from those who know my

                        <b> A significant estate as a gift, free and unrestricted.</b> As for the claim presented as
                        fact, I
                        have already refuted it;
                        now, a few words about its likelihood. Where, indeed, is a writer, who merely recommends a
                        certain structure for rural
                        organization, ever gifted a domain for the purpose of experimenting with its implementation?
                        <br><br>
                        What minister would dare to propose such a thing, and what prudent man, in my former position,
                        would reach for such a
                        dubious gift? If a proposal of this kind—namely, for conducting an experiment—had ever been made
                        to me, which it
                        absolutely was not, either in writing or verbally, I would, as a matter of reason, only have
                        considered it on the basis
                        of being appointed as an administrator. And I hope, with God's help, that, in the face of such a
                        proposal, I would have
                        retained enough prudence to avoid slippery ground and to negotiate sufficient freedom of action
                        and safeguards against
                        obstacles deliberately placed by people—obstacles that are always infinitely more challenging
                        than those inherent to the
                        nature of the task itself—which were necessary, given my position, especially at that time, for
                        the potential success of
                        the endeavor.

                            A respectable estate offered as a free and unencumbered gift. Herr von Oeder rebutted this
                            excessively bold falsehood
                            simply by stating that, if such an offer had indeed been made to him—which was not the
                            case—he would only have taken on
                            the management of such an estate as an administrator. In that case, he believes he would
                            have implemented measures to
                            realize his proposals that could not possibly have failed. One may take his assurance at his
                            word, for Herr von Oeder
                            was no idle project-maker, nor has he ever been regarded as such by the Danish or German
                            public, except by those who are
                            either unwilling or unable to recognize true talent. Moreover, the highly improbable offer,
                            which could have only been
                            concocted in Herr Conferenzrath’s head filled with lofty Ossianic fantasies, has thus
                            turned, as did Nebuchadnezzar's
                            metal statue, into dust and ashes—indeed, into nothingness.
                            <br><br>
                            Suppose, however, that the so-called German—of whom all these absurdities originated (what a
                            way to write!)—was offered
                            a respectable estate as a free and unencumbered gift. What would a man of simple common
                            sense have thought about such a
                            peculiar and slippery offer? Herr von Oeder only states that he would have accepted such an
                            offer solely in the capacity
                            of an administrator, and that would indeed have been the safest means of guarding against
                            any contingencies. Who, for
                            all the world, would want to accept an estate without knowing the capital to fund the
                            necessary—and in this case even
                            conditional—improvements? Gudumlund has been improved, but according to records, the
                            improvement of this estate cost
                            Herr Chamberlain von Buchwald a loss of 25,000 thalers, despite the government’s significant
                            support. Herr von Oeder,
                            had this offer been made to him, certainly did not have such a fallback. He was no
                            project-maker either and, therefore,
                            would naturally have recited the Lord’s Prayer at such a tempting offer: “Lead us not into
                            temptation but deliver us
                            from evil. Amen!”
                            <br><br>
                            Moreover, if Herr Conferenzrath tells us anything about people whose well-being and
                            livelihood depend on a dearly
                            purchased estate, in which large sums that must earn interest are often tied up, it would
                            certainly be better and more
                            desirable if good, even large estates were not so frequently sold, resold, and resold again
                            on the islands, especially
                            in Jutland.
                            <br><br>
                            This frequent reselling is the true ruin of estates. Rarely does the buyer invest even a
                            third, often scarcely a fifth,
                            of the purchase price from his own resources into the estate—sometimes nothing at all. Hence
                            the large, money-consuming
                            interest payments. From an already poorly managed estate, the interest, the agreed repayment
                            of the purchase price, and
                            a lifestyle befitting the estate’s value are expected to be maintained. Improvement of the
                            estate is often neglected for
                            lack of desire, knowledge, and, worst of all, the essential nervus rerum gerendarum (the
                            wherewithal to act). Thus,
                            after living a few years as a landowner, one resells the estate—if fortunate—or, as often
                            happens, one declares
                            insolvency, and so, as one might say, the comedy ends: let us go to the table and eat.
                            <br><br>
                            I myself once resided on such a dearly bought estate in Zealand; it barely lasted a year
                            before the buyer, likely unable
                            to pay, shot himself dead. However, the islands and the state of estates and lordships there
                            are less familiar to me
                            than Jutland and the duchies. I have observed enough in my travels, however, to note a
                            notable difference between the
                            countryfolk on the island of Funen and those on Zealand. In Funen, the farmer was
                            well-built, clean and neatly dressed,
                            lively, active, and not sluggish or slow at work. The houses were quite nice and tidy. It
                            did not seem the same in
                            Zealand, however.
                            <br><br>
                            But as a traveler, I may have mistaken or misjudged some things. Suffice it to say, the
                            dwellings of the countryfolk
                            seemed very poor and barely habitable; their residents struck me as downcast, unclean, much
                            less flexible, and not
                            particularly inclined to work. I attributed this whole scene to the oppressive system of
                            serfdom, and without this
                            appeal, I would not have recalled this comparison. As for Jutland, let me say only this:
                            large and productive estates
                            lie in this very spacious and potentially populous stretch of land, but how most of these
                            estates appear can be fully
                            grasped from Herr von Buchwald’s records, if one has not seen them for oneself. But until
                            all these estates are treated
                            like Gudumlund, how can one hope for improvement? How can one hope for this when living at
                            the borders of Jutland, where
                            one sees noblemen or landowners coming and going? It is true, their entourage displays the
                            wealth of a satrap of old;
                            but as for their way of life? When one looks more closely at a man who has just become
                            noble, especially if he has by
                            various means obtained the chamberlain's key, or otherwise examines the highly titled
                            landowner more deeply than his
                            outward appearance, one can confidently say, with the poet:
                            <br><br>
                            "Certainly, he is a lord. But if I had command,Verres would, in truth, be herding swine. His
                            coachman would sooner carry
                            the steward's staff,I'd put him in the carriage and Verres on the box."
                            <br><br>
                            In general, I believe I can rightly claim that most estates in Jutland are in the hands of
                            people whom the world knows
                            nothing of, and that it will never learn that they could serve the country with sword, pen,
                            or useful enterprises. And
                            these people dare to threaten a kind, law-abiding government.

                            know at all (I am quite certain that Councilor Fleischer has not judged von Oeder by his

                            experience, and even less by his heart), yet dare to write scornfully about them. Would it
                            not be possible that from
                            such hasty and unjust judges certain traits might also be revealed, which, if made public,

                            mushroom loved by gourmands, but the humble mushroom, standing there beside the puffed-up
                            champignon, unnoticed perhaps,
                            also has its uses. Both remain earth mushrooms; and so it is with many sublunary souls.

                            Anyone who can accuse von Oeder of baseness is welcome to step forward. This person will
                            certainly find staunch
                            defenders among fair-minded Danes and impartial Germans. Von Oeder was no god. In certain
                            matters, he displayed striking
                            faults; for that, he was one of Adam's children. But to accuse him of a base disposition is
                            an offense. Just one example
                            of his way of thinking: On his last visit to Copenhagen, he recounted to a friend, with a
                            smile that suited him well and
                            a twinkle in his eye, the following story. When I, he said, was appointed as the chief
                            deputy in the Nordic Chamber, I
                            was soon met by a very prominent man who, during the time I lived at Friedrichs Hospital,
                            had been my neighbor across
                            the way but had never deemed it worth his effort to cast an eye on me. But as a deputy of
                            the Chamber, his eyes must
                            have seen me in a completely different light. This prominent man suddenly rushed towards me,
                            boasting as he greeted me
                            of his longstanding respect and friendship for me, and invited me to consider his summer
                            palace, located not far from
                            the city, as my own for the season, offering it with all its comforts for my leisure and
                            needs as a sign of his
                            eagerness to serve. I was taken aback, said Oeder, who was proud of his accomplishments, and
                            made a frosty response,
                            avoiding as best as I could a company that was deeply unpleasant to me. Such friendships,
                            expressed merely due to the
                            circumstances of the time, have no value to me. I detest them. So thought von Oeder, and the
                            one who heard this story
                            from his own mouth wishes to share it with the world as a testament to his way of thinking.
                            Can Councilor Fleischer
                            still call von Oeder despicable? Then let him. But who will, who can, who wishes to believe
                            him?

                        Proposals — should be followed. — At no place, at no time, neither as a writer nor as a member
                        of the Commission on Land
                        Management have I made proposals concerning the use of property that should compel landowners to
                        act. I have
                        deliberately sought on every occasion to demonstrate what should be done by command and what
                        could only be achieved
                        through example.
                        <br><br>
                        The principle from which I proceed, and from which every discussion on the relationship between
                        the landowner and the
                        peasants belonging to the estate must proceed, is that the peasant is, according to Danish law,
                        a free man. If he could
                        now fully enjoy this personal freedom, if he had the power to thrive and contract with the
                        landowner as a free tenant on
                        mutually agreeable terms, then the King could leave these contracts solely under the protection
                        of common justice.
                        However, as circumstances still require a transitional period with wise limitations on said
                        enjoyment, a period which
                        must be shortened as much as possible, the King is not only authorized but obligated by justice
                        to intervene by command
                        to aid the contracting party who is clearly in a disadvantaged position—the peasants,
                        particularly concerning the
                        regulation of compulsory labor.

                        Anyone who speaks and acts as I have spoken and acted, within the scope of my responsibilities,
                        does not deserve to be
                        opposed; it would be incomprehensible that I have been opposed in this way if it were not for
                        the power of prejudice,
                        which makes much understandable. And it truly takes intention for those who refuse to recognize
                        the prevailing spirit of
                        moderation in my considerations and additions to them.

                        The esteemed public to whom I speak, allow me to make two more remarks. The first is this: For
                        us on this side of the
                        Elbe, who are originally from countries, or who know countries where a better system of land
                        management and peasant
                        status has been established and maintained for generations, further debate on the matter is as
                        exhausting as any dispute
                        over settled issues. If the gentlemen proprietors among the Danes, especially the writers among
                        them, wanted to limit
                        their arguments to the notion that progress from the lesser to the better must be approached
                        gradually, always
                        cautiously, and above all, not violently, then that could be heard, and one could discuss the
                        best procedures. But when
                        they tout the state of their estates and the peasant system as excellent, indeed unchangeable in
                        all seriousness, it is
                        met with either a smile or with boredom, and one feels as though one were hearing Linguet's
                        praise of slavery among the
                        Greeks and Romans.

                            <b>Refusing to See or Acknowledge Deliberately.</b> Von Oeder rightly writes a little
                            further on:
                            “For us on this side of the Elbe, who either hail from lands or otherwise know them where
                            the constitution of the country and the peasant class have been established for generations,
                            another dispute is as exhausting as any dispute over settled matters.” And for this reason,
                            I also wish to conclude my small observations about this petty, though in a certain sense
                            compelled, bickering with von Oeder and say just a little more about such people who, in the
                            pathetic clamor of complaints about the misfortunes and harms foreigners have brought to
                            Denmark, and who, if not driven from the country (I believe that the zeal of these Danish
                            enragés would gladly have all those still living among them who are not natives march, like
                            Philip III did with the Moors in Spain, his most diligent and loyal subjects, across the
                            Elbe, as he sent them to Africa—if only the better-informed and more humane government would
                            share their mindset).
                            <br><br>
                            Yet, thank Heaven, there are not many Danes who outright, like Mr. Councilor Fleischer (he
                            can see it), out of moving reasons, perhaps out of blind loyalty, refuse to see or
                            acknowledge.
                            <br><br>
                            There are also many who genuinely cannot see, only think they can see—among them, I
                            particularly count the author of the previously mentioned text Rigsbank Dollar Bill
                            Events—and among those who, unlike Councilor Fleischer, the chamberlain von Lüttichow, and
                            other property owners, really can see but refuse to acknowledge the truth, I will, to avoid
                            verbosity, refrain from further discussion here and will not try to offer reasons why they
                            refuse to see, as these are already well-known and must become even more so. For this
                            reason, I will limit myself to a few words about the author of The Rigsbank Dollar Bill and
                            his ilk, who truly cannot see and, driven by a small, willful yet quite mundane
                            understanding combined with a very low-grade hatred (which they cannot justify) against all
                            that is foreign, consider it true satire, and then let the little barkers bark and howl in
                            the future.
                            <br><br>
                            Of the few issues that fell into my hands (for, as mentioned, such writings do not reach me
                            like the songs of Bagge or Bastholm’s sermons on the Coldinger and Nips Aue—this, these
                            slanderous gentlemen know all too well), I will highlight only a few passages and leave it
                            to every impartial reader to decide whether I am right or wrong in comparing such Danish
                            writers to the enragés in Paris. I will demonstrate that many of these gentlemen, like Mr.
                            Councilor, can indeed see quite well but, out of moving reasons, refuse to acknowledge,
                            while many other writers, like the one I am referring to, truly cannot see, and with that, I
                            will, though I could say much about von Oeder’s thoughts, nevertheless conclude my judgment
                            and hope that the completely irrational, exaggerated hatred and the low-grade mockery
                            against everything German—indeed, even against their German-speaking fellow citizens, which
                            is somewhat punishable and certainly not in accordance with the duties of a faithful subject
                            who loves his royal father of German descent—might finally, if not cease entirely, at least
                            remain within the bounds of common decency. For, indeed, in many passages of The Rigsbank
                            Dollar Bill, I could not restrain myself from exclaiming: "That was coarse and very
                            boorish!"
                            <br><br>
                            Here are my small observations, which I do not hesitate to lay before the public for
                            judgment, whether I am right or wrong.
                            In The Rigsbank Dollar Bill Events, No. II, pp. 117–121, the author of this imitative
                            periodical introduces a German professor who, if he had graduated from Prima, a poor town
                            school, could hardly think or act more poorly or miserably. Must one not rightly ask: Dear
                            author, is this German professor you are describing and portraying to the reader truly a
                            scholar based in Copenhagen? What is this man’s name? In which faculty does he teach? The
                            German men who take the podium and teach in Copenhagen are known to the world as true
                            scholars and upright men. They do not make such a miserable figure as this utterly wretched
                            professor you have introduced on stage. Confirm for us, the German readers, that in
                            Copenhagen there actually is a man like the one you have described who mounts the podium.
                            What will you answer? If the man indeed exists, name him. Then the whole world will wonder
                            how His Highness the Hereditary Prince of Augustenburg, along with his accompanying academic
                            commission, could appoint such a wretched creature as a professor, and how the entire body
                            of professors at the university, bearing among themselves one crow adorned with peacock
                            feathers, could tolerate and call him a colleague. If this professor, which any reasonable
                            person would hardly doubt, sprang from your imagination like Milton’s Sin, then what is to
                            be said? Is it not plainly malicious to bring forth a ghost from your brain as if it were a
                            man from a nation worthy of respect? What have you gained?

                        The other remark is this: Among all European states, England is the one for which Denmark has
                        the most cause to imitate;
                        the gentlemen Danes cannot deny the excellence of the English system of land management and its
                        greater profitability
                        for the landowners. Nevertheless, the structure of land management in England has also been
                        similar to that in Denmark
                        until 1660, when the forced labor in that country was abolished by a royal decree. However, I
                        advise the King of
                        Denmark, a completely absolute lord, not to seek an absolute abolition but only a determination
                        of the forced labor, a
                        regulation of what is unreasonable and arbitrary, against which every sense of right and
                        fairness opposes itself. In
                        doing so, I recommend comparing the history of the forced labor regulations with pages 62 and 67
                        of my writings, which
                        summarize the history of the regulations concerning the national troops, to gauge what an
                        impartial historian might
                        eventually say about Denmark. I, no longer a servant nor subject of this state, but a German
                        sincerely wishing all the
                        best for it and its rulers, conclude with the assertion that nothing will come of Denmark that
                        could be until it reaches
                        the point where, as in England, the terms tenant and peasant become synonymous in practice, as
                        they already are
                        according to the intent and meaning of Danish law. Until then, in every part of the
                        administration, at every step, even
                        with the best intentions and the wisest measures, they will encounter the inevitable
                        consequences of an unfavorable
                        consideration of the class that constitutes three-quarters of the nation.

                            even possible? Imagine a fellow countryman who, in one breath like this German professor,
                            alternates between the accents of Zealand, Funen, North Jutland, and South Jutland. Is it
                            possible to even imagine such a person? It is common experience that one's homeland's accent
                            remains distinctive, no matter how far one is thrown into the world. Your professor speaks
                            first as a Lower Saxon, then immediately like a Swabian, then as a Thuringian, and soon
                            after as if he were born in Quedlinburg or by the Saale. What, dear professor, have you
                            truly achieved with your so-called satire? Nothing, absolutely nothing, except to show that
                            you have no ability to distinguish between German provincial accents. This is forgivable,
                            but please, admit openly that your professor, who doesn’t actually exist, is nothing more
                            than a complete chimera.
                            <br><br>
                            In the comedy Virtuosen, issue No. 13, p. 143, you let your hero, under the name of Spazier,
                            speak poor Danish as a German, while his master, Mr. von Borgen, speaks poor German as a
                            Dane. Whether a figure as ridiculous as Mr. von Borgen has actually existed among your
                            countrymen is not for me to investigate. However, I utterly deny that your Mr. Spazier, or
                            any German or other foreigner, has ever suggested the outrageous notion of killing healthy
                            cattle along with the sick and burying them, skin and all, in the ground or even burning
                            down the barns if cattle disease was suspected. My dear author, research the country’s
                            history a bit better before taking pleasure in burdening people of other nations with ideas
                            that have never occurred to them. Such unfair and utterly false accusations against innocent
                            people are not becoming of a gentleman, which you strive to be.
                            <br><br>
                            Your criticism of the foreign virtuoso in No. 14, p. 216, is entirely unjust and offends all
                            politeness. It reveals your exaggerated and utterly baseless, ill-considered hatred, even
                            against foreign artists of merit, who are not here to make a fortune but merely to display
                            their exceptional talents, which neither the French nor the British dismiss. When the state
                            allows such an artist to perform, it simply acknowledges the foreigner’s talents, if he has
                            any. If the government permits a virtuoso to hold a concert to be evaluated by the public
                            and to earn an income, this income rightly belongs to the artist. Seeking to secure my
                            property is no sin. Courtesy is what virtuoso Hommel showed by granting the theater
                            collector his share. For him to insist on having an observer beside him was neither
                            unreasonable nor impolite; the virtuoso merely sought to confirm his property rights. Among
                            other nations, such an act would never inspire the kind of hateful mockery you, with your
                            bitterness against anything foreign, intentionally heap upon it.
                            <br><br>
                            Furthermore, what the author hints at very obscurely in those same issues on p. 288—I had
                            already thought of it when, after Frederick's death, I saw the model for the statue of
                            Frederick V with its attributes and noted that it turned out quite different than planned.
                            Similarly, I criticize when the world is informed that a very important work on Denmark is
                            being written, and this much-anticipated work is finally presented to the public, but not by
                            the scholar whom the world expected. Such performances by foreigners, who are called upon
                            and well-compensated, do indeed give grounds for criticism, and to withhold from a native
                            the right to such fair criticism would be unjust. In cases like these, the author, in my
                            view, is entirely justified in criticizing foreigners, whether they are Germans, French, or
                            Gentoo.

                            The war with foolish and rather unintelligent parasitic princes will likely soon be
                            forgotten, and peace will be made between the parties. One crow does not peck out another's
                            eyes. In the meantime, the author of the Rigsbank Dollar Bill Affairs writes unfoundedly,
                            unpleasantly, and insultingly.

                    Under the headings of some economic-political observations regarding Norway, which I intended to
                    address when I have
                    more leisure and motivation, there is also one about a city in the Northern Lands, of which I will
                    set down some

                            <b> Incentive. </b>That this treatise deserves all possible attention is certainly not to be
                            doubted
                            by any of our countrymen.
                            Therefore, my good or bad demon has led me to leave one thought or another about the mention
                            of this city on paper. Even
                            if they are not entirely necessary to be said, I hope they will not be entirely
                            insignificant.
                            <br><br>
                            The author of this writing is indeed unmistakable, and I have the just hope that, if I take
                            the liberty of prophesying
                            his fate after his death, likening it to Milton's with his lost paradise, I will not have to
                            fear being cast out from
                            the guild of prophets.
                            <br><br>
                            Upon the very composition, I noticed something about "Incentive" in the first period.
                            Neither the cosmopolitan nor the
                            patriot needs to demand an incentive to make known a thought for the good of the fatherland.
                            The cosmopolitan dares to
                            express it out of love for humanity, out of love for the common good, and without making
                            himself suspicious of being a
                            project maker; he says it and—remains silent. The patriot states it plainly; he has done his
                            duty and saved his soul.
                            However, when I consider the position of the author and know that what he wrote he presented
                            to the public solely as a
                            cosmopolitan, one could indeed, if one found taste in his suggestions, which, as the passage
                            of time has taught, were
                            not entirely written in vain, demand a certain incentive as a scholar serving above the
                            Elbe. Since he mentions many
                            other writings, of which, however, only a few have appeared in the collections of Mr. Prof.
                            Heinze, it remains very
                            probable that precisely due to the lack of incentive, the other certainly valuable
                            treatises—especially what he wrote
                            about the Widows’ Fund in Copenhagen, as well as about the one in Hamburg, where he, if I am
                            not mistaken, expressed an
                            incentive pro studio & labore—might still have been left lying in the desk. Fragments may be
                            found here and there in
                            other hands, but nothing complete. It would be desirable for a friend of the widow to
                            recommend sharing these surely not
                            superficially elaborated but thoughtfully composed, with insight and knowledge of the
                            country, works with the world.
                            <br><br>
                            Since this treatise was already written in 1763, my doubts will at least not be offensive.
                            The proposal was submitted to
                            the government in 1763, but was only made known to the public in the year 1786. It therefore
                            seems that the government
                            found it necessary to deliberate for a very long time before engaging with the proposal. It
                            was probably regarded only
                            as a political project because, in certain individual cases, there may always be reasons
                            according to the opinions of
                            the interested statisticians that have deemed it advisable to refrain from taking action on
                            the work. Nevertheless,
                            according to public reports, this proposal, with some changes, will no longer be a problem
                            for the true fame of the
                            author and as clear evidence of his knowledge.

                            In civil status, there is a deficiency. However, if the author claims that there is a lack
                            of improvement in Norway and
                            Denmark, both in the peasant or rural status as well as in the civil status, I will here
                            only point out that King Olof
                            Kyree (the peaceful) had already established this beneficial and unique fundamental
                            principle for all kingdoms whose
                            constitution should be built on a solid foundation. This king, amidst a series of warlike,
                            plundering, and half-barbaric
                            kings, the greatest adventurers of their time, did what still today insightful writers of
                            Denmark have no hesitation in
                            praising. He engaged himself, without ever thinking of a military campaign, in the internal
                            organization of his realm.
                            Around this time, about 1080, he sought to contest a monstrosity that must still be
                            contested anew by paternal-minded
                            rulers in 1791. I mean serfdom. Denmark could make significant peaceful conquests within its
                            territory, says a foreign
                            writer, but all improvements are mere soap bubbles as long as serfdom weakens this beautiful
                            kingdom. Should Christian
                            VII not, like a northern Hercules, with the help of Friedrich, as a faithful Iolaus, finally
                            eradicate this hydra from
                            his blessed kingdom and consigned it to eternal oblivion in Phlegethon? This beneficial
                            endeavor shall also be reserved
                            for the execution of his reign.
                            <br><br>
                            In the meantime, I will not forget to mention, for the sake of excess, what Olaf Kyree had
                            already conceived at his time
                            regarding the legislation of Norway. Olaf Kyree, it is said, the son of King Harald
                            Hoodraade, a half-brother of Olaf
                            the Holy, reigned from 1664 to 1687. Various of his ordinances can be found in the
                            Gulethings Lov, but one cannot
                            distinguish them exactly from others. His arrangements regarding the hospitality towards
                            foreigners at his court, as
                            well as various other initiatives, testify to his intention to educate his countrymen by
                            introducing foreign customs. To
                            make them agreeable, he established the St. Olav guilds; he built large stone houses for
                            them in the trading towns and
                            forbade that anyone should drink at their neighbor's home as before. He granted these guild
                            halls their own laws; the
                            clergy, even the bishops themselves, had to be present to oversee and suppress disputes. The
                            kingdom thus gained
                            significantly in terms of internal peace. To help commerce, he founded the trading town of
                            Bergen in 1670, presumably
                            also Stavanger and Konghella. With the same intention, he sought to abolish serfdom. He
                            ordered that in each district
                            (Sylcke) one man should be freed each year, and should be paid for by the common man. These
                            individuals understood a
                            craft, and when they were free, they moved to the cities that thereby emerged. To arrange
                            the ecclesiastical structure
                            more orderly, he provided bishops with an annual salary. He assigned them certain districts
                            and mandated that each
                            peasant should give them an "Oertug," that is, 1 ½ Danish shilling. Thus, he laid the first
                            foundation for their
                            permanent residence in Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger, and Oslo. He also decreed that the
                            people in each district should
                            build a church; he himself built Christ Church in Bergen and began the construction of the
                            one in Trondheim. These laws
                            were given by Olof Kyree in the tenth century, and I cannot therefore refrain from
                            mentioning the following observation
                            of this author here, when he writes about the government and legislation of the Norwegian
                            King Hogen Magnussen, the
                            second son of Magnus Lagabøte, who reigned from 1299 to 1319: When one compares these and
                            similar decrees of this king,
                            indeed even various older ones, with what was done around the same time in Germany, France,
                            and England, in short, in
                            most European countries regarding the administration of justice; it will surely not escape
                            the notice of any attentive
                            observer that our North during the entire period from the 11th to the 14th century was
                            indeed far more enlightened, far
                            more civilized, and truly also more orderly with respect to the state constitution than most
                            of the rest of Europe. What
                            are we at the end of the eighteenth century? </i> </p>

                        The influence of civic trade on agriculture becomes evident when it is placed in close and
                        multiple connections, as one
                        can observe upon approaching large cities. This observation is generally true and applies also
                        to Norway. The mines, the
                        sole branch of civic trade in the country’s interior, serve as proof of this; each one is, in
                        its area, the foundation
                        for the existence of numerous farms. In short, wherever a significant branch of civic trade has
                        established itself,
                        barren lands become fertile, while regions with naturally rich soil, without trade, remain poor
                        and only moderately
                        populated.

                            From another noble patriot, I once came across the following thoughts about Norway. I
                            believe they are in the right
                            place here. — This patriot from Norway wrote around the year 1764, “I must almost believe
                            that, instead of traveling
                            north, I have come closer to the equator; for in the last few weeks, and almost the entire
                            time I have been here, it has
                            been extraordinarily warm, and little or no rain has fallen. For three or four weeks, we
                            have had a real drought. I can
                            say that I have only been one day in Norway, for in two months I have not seen a single
                            night. I would gladly give up
                            some of my days if I could receive something in return in three or four months.
                            Nevertheless, Norway is an excellent and
                            beautiful country, which could still be much better. Thank God, we are free from livestock
                            disease here; it is a true
                            blessing of Providence, for if the plague were in this land, the distress would be
                            unspeakable. The milk is very good.
                            We have excellent strawberries and melons, and I have already harvested exceedingly good
                            sugar peas from my garden.
                            <br><br>
                            People are lacking in Norway, and my focus is primarily on increasing the population, for
                            which I propose a very simple
                            means, namely: to allow an Odelsman or Odels owner to divide his estate among three or four
                            sons and to exempt him and
                            his children from military service if he wants to designate a farmhouse for a soldier. I do
                            not require any ordinance,
                            just a permission that will result in the immediate promotion of 10 to 12000 men in the
                            first year. Another time, this
                            true Musegai wrote: “I must indeed confess that I must believe there is no better land in
                            the world than Norway. There
                            are areas here where many farmers sow grain, barley, or oats in rotation for 15 to 20 years
                            in a row without letting the
                            field rest for a single year, and some do not even fertilize it. There would be much to
                            accomplish here if only the
                            common man were a bit more diligent and the superiors had more zeal for the common good. To
                            what extent this noble man
                            hit the mark, I leave to the reader’s judgment.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, since the northern lands and Finnmarken, regions that were so densely populated, indeed
                            almost overpopulated, in
                            ancient times until 1300, are now probably the least populated in all of Europe without any
                            dispute — a report states:
                            The northern lands, a large province of 2082 square miles, has or counts only 28 people per
                            square mile, and Finnmarken
                            shares this report, almost unbelievable, with only 5 people — I believe that, nonetheless,
                            at the outset, the
                            excessively numerous and devastating class of beggars in the realm and in the provinces,
                            without further thinking about
                            colonists, would be sufficient to repopulate these fertile regions. At some later point, a
                            shift from the metropolis
                            would bring luxury and joy to these now sorrowful regions and successfully restore their old
                            prosperity under a not so
                            warlike generation, bringing them back to life anew. I find it unnecessary to say more about
                            this for now.

                        All means of sustenance in the state, and with them the state itself, rest on the exchange of
                        goods and mutual services,
                        and everything depends on the variety and speed of this exchange.
                        <br><br>
                        The diverse opportunities for this exchange make every effort and diligence fruitful,
                        encouraging it when everyone has
                        buyers and admirers for their surplus or services, and all are prepared to serve each other in
                        turn. Agriculture in
                        England was once restricted along with the freedom to export grain, and its current prosperity
                        owes much to the
                        encouragement for export. Farming yields countless minor products, aside from the more valuable
                        goods, which together
                        are of great benefit to the farmer if he can readily sell them, but are lost to him if that
                        opportunity is lacking.

                        The speed of exchange saves time, and this unacknowledged, so little esteemed good is, after
                        all, the most important of
                        all goods, for the use of time underpins the use of all other goods. The same benefit that a
                        factory gains from the
                        factory-like handling of goods and labor—where specific hands are employed for specific tasks
                        alone, as this allows each
                        maneuver to proceed most quickly and at the same time most effectively—brings similar benefit to
                        the entire state from
                        the acceleration of trade and exchange among its members.

                        These principles are fruitful in a multitude of consequences, which one can easily deduce for
                        oneself and which I cannot
                        fully elaborate here. Denmark, as well as Norway, are affected by various of these consequences,
                        and although my
                        thoughts are mainly directed toward Norway, I cannot refrain from making a few remarks on
                        Denmark as well.

                            <b> The Flourishing of the State.</b> The author takes as a principle on page 35 that the
                            influence
                            of civil trades on
                            agriculture, when placed in close and multiple connection, is extraordinarily beneficial to
                            the state. He proves this as
                            an eyewitness with the mining towns in the interior of Norway. Since the author also states
                            that he will extend the
                            consequences of his principles to Denmark, it will be all the more permissible for me to
                            speak little about Norway,
                            which I do not know well, but much more about these consequences in Denmark and the duchies.
                            Thus, this advantage of the
                            farmer, being able to sell his goods immediately, constitutes such a significant branch of
                            nourishment according to this
                            principle of the author, that deserts are made fertile through it, and where it is lacking,
                            countries, although endowed
                            with a naturally rich soil, remain isolated, poor, and depopulated. Without further applying
                            this principle from Norway,
                            I will pause at an area a few miles along the western coast of Jutland and make an attempt
                            to see if this principle can
                            be applied not only here but also in many other regions of the realm, which I must leave to
                            other patriots to consider.

                            According to my little experience, I wish to consider the stretch of land from Ribe to
                            Tondern, extending eastward to
                            Haderslev and somewhat south to Flensburg. Once and for all, Mr. Mayor Bruyn must forgive me
                            for not agreeing with his
                            opinion that the duchies were sufficiently populated with the realm. I align myself with the
                            view of the author of the
                            "Lettres sur Danemark" and believe that the duchies, along with the realm, could sustain at
                            least twice as many people
                            as they currently have, given the naturally rich and fertile soil. The reasons why serfdom
                            still finds its protectors
                            and why the potential population continues to be overlooked and neglected are beyond the
                            scope of my profession. It
                            suffices to consider the older times somewhat; when observing the migration of the Cimbri
                            and Teutons to Italy, and
                            seeing Waldemar the Great at the head of 160,000 men, one must believe that Denmark was
                            populated quite differently in
                            both periods than in our days. It is unnecessary to further illuminate and establish this
                            opinion here. Enough, I return
                            to the mentioned region; Ribe was once a populous, nourishing, and, according to the luxury
                            of those times, a
                            magnificent and powerful city. From Ribe, writes the General World History, Vol. XIV, p.
                            341, ships sailed in ancient
                            times to Friesland, Saxony, and England, even as far as the Mediterranean trading places,
                            particularly Alexandria, and
                            finally from Aarhus one sailed to Funen, Zealand, and Norway. The Danish seafarers exchanged
                            beer and linen, which they
                            likely learned to make from the Phoenicians, as well as amber, fish, and other products for
                            other goods and also for
                            foreign money, which is why many Arabic and Roman coins are still found in the burial
                            mounds. Their glory did not fade
                            during the Middle Ages, but Ribe hardly shines now. Maritime trade is negligible compared to
                            those times, and one can
                            hardly notice trade in a town that is so well situated for commerce.

                        When I look at our Danish provincial towns and their inhabitants—villages given the name of
                        cities, and farmers given
                        the name of citizens—and when I consider in Norway the much-praised skill of the farmer in
                        making his household items,
                        tools, and clothing, both serve as evidence to me of an unfavorable constitution in both
                        kingdoms. I find that cities in
                        Denmark lack the opportunity for civic industries and urban livelihoods, and that farmers in
                        Norway should have towns
                        and skilled tradespeople closer to them.

                            The farmer of the Duchy of Schleswig, or rather the subject of the office of Haderslev,
                            possesses land almost near the
                            gates of the city, and yet one does not notice that he seeks to sell his products in Ribe.
                            He much prefers to take his
                            route to Lygum Kloster, Tondern, Haderslev; indeed, he often goes as far as Flensburg. These
                            are towns located three,
                            four, or even six to seven miles away from him.
                            <br><br>
                            Why does he not sell closer to the city? One can only speculate, but nothing definitive can
                            be stated. I shall therefore
                            have only mere conjectures to say and write down. The first reason seems to me to be the
                            different conditions of the
                            realm compared to the provinces. In Ribe, the so-called consumption tax, known in Germany as
                            Licent, is levied, from
                            which the duchies are exempted due to their rights and acquired privileges. This tax holds
                            the farmer back somewhat from
                            this side, but I do not think it is the primary reason for his significant avoidance of
                            trade with this city.
                            <br><br>
                            The most important reason for his avoidance is likely that since Ribe primarily engages in
                            agricultural rather than
                            civic or urban trade, he always knows in advance that he will not be able to sell his
                            products at reasonable prices due
                            to the higher consumption tax. He therefore prefers to go a few miles further, and in Ribe,
                            the citizen feeds more on
                            agricultural than urban economy. However, precisely because of this, the city remains
                            entirely out of consideration as a
                            city. In a word, if trade and commerce, which can alone elevate a city, are stagnant, they
                            contribute to weakness and
                            poverty.

                        When I consider the condition of the peasant class in Denmark, I find that this class is
                        oppressed not only by the lack
                        of property and freedom, but also by the waste or altogether unproductive use of time, which is
                        largely due to service
                        obligations on estates. Anyone even slightly familiar with the countryside must have noticed how
                        little a peasant’s
                        time, how few of his whole days are valued, and how much he becomes accustomed to undervaluing
                        them himself. However, if
                        the peasant were granted property and then given free use of his time, his own benefit would
                        teach him the most
                        productive use of it far better than external insights and regulations could. Meanwhile, to
                        repeat, the use of all
                        resources depends on the use of time; thus, a country in which most hands and the majority of
                        time are spent
                        unproductively will inevitably lag behind other countries, where every inhabitant applies their
                        time and labor to the
                        best of their abilities.

                            It is no better with Hadersleben; even there, the farmer knows that he cannot effectively
                            market his products due to the
                            aforementioned reasons. This once-flourishing city increasingly engages in agriculture
                            rather than urban nourishment.
                            Trade and commerce decline every year, and the city is becoming poorer than it has ever
                            been. Auctions are frequently
                            announced by the drum and the crier. While Hadersleben used to build frigates and had two to
                            three ships at sea, it can
                            no longer hide its decline behind the apparent luxury. Flensburg is far away, and Tundern
                            and Lygum Kloster cannot
                            quickly make use of everything that the farmer could bring, so it remains that if one
                            investigates closely, this entire
                            area is not populated as it reasonably should be, due to the low and uncertain demand for
                            the farmer’s products. One
                            notices all the shortcomings that the author recounts to us about Norway. In the cities,
                            artisans are more farmers than
                            they should be, and in the countryside, the farmer makes do, repairs, and patches his house
                            and equipment as best he can
                            due to the lack of craftsmen, and everything remains, as the Apostle Paul would say,
                            piecemeal. Both classes do not
                            actually know what they are. The rural towns increasingly lose their nourishment and
                            resemble, as the author rightly
                            states, more villages than cities. The perspectives of Danish rural towns in the atlas of
                            the worthy Bishop Pontoppidan
                            provide us, even if one has not seen them oneself, the most undeniable evidence of these
                            truths. And these political
                            errors of Norway and Denmark stand against the population in these and several other areas
                            in the Duchy of Schleswig. It
                            surprises me that the author has noted this political error only in Norway and not in the
                            more southern regions.
                            <br><br>
                            As for what the author says about the metropolis, it is a common complaint and an unyielding
                            rock that cannot be removed
                            or even moved. It remains an eternally established fundamental truth: A metropolis too large
                            for the state body is
                            always a giant head on the body of a dwarf. Iusti sought to assert these truths long before
                            the author did. However, he
                            was soon sent across the Elbe, just like the author himself. This song still offends a
                            powerful party that does not
                            think so. And this party is despotic.
                            <br><br>
                            Now the author comes to the state of the peasantry in Denmark, which I accept as true, and I
                            only emphasize the author's
                            principle on page 77, when he says: Thus, the land in which most hands and most time are
                            unprofitably employed must, in
                            comparison with other countries where every resident applies his time and hands to the best
                            of his knowledge, remain
                            visibly behind.
                            <br><br>
                            This advantage for the farmer, to bring his products and processes directly to the consumer,
                            would be desirable not only
                            for Norway but also for the realm and even for the provinces. How quickly spinning and
                            weaving, and many other trades,
                            would come into practice! Flax cultivation would gradually become more known, and the
                            population would noticeably
                            increase, especially where the best land still sighs under the unproductive heath. But now
                            the poor farmer sighs under
                            the iron yoke of the excessively usurious trader, known as the merchant, and the merciless
                            seller sneaking around in the
                            rural towns. This oppressive usury does not give rise to the farmer's joy, as it does in
                            Silesia, on the Harz, and from
                            Westphalia to the Dutch border, while ours spends summer and winter with a full stomach,
                            sleeping through the afternoon
                            and idly chatting away the evening with the women over a pipe of tobacco, instead of sitting
                            down at the spinning wheel
                            with his children to gain something for their nourishment besides fieldwork. This branch of
                            industry is already
                            completely lost in the provinces for the aforementioned reasons and conditions of the
                            nutritional state, let alone in
                            Norway.

                        With the foundation of these principles, let us now turn to the consideration of the northern
                        lands in Norway.
                        <br><br>
                        The northern lands begin about twenty miles from Drontheim and extend up to Finmark over a
                        stretch of 70 to 80 miles.
                        They consist of islands and fjords, or narrow bays, from whose innermost ends it is nowhere far
                        to the mountain range
                        between Norway and Sweden. These fjords are essentially valleys between high, rugged mountains
                        and are inhabited along
                        the edges of the bays. These valleys extend to the mountain range that runs from north to south
                        in various positions,
                        curves, and branches for twelve miles or more. All the inhabitants of the northern lands,
                        including those in the
                        fjords—at least those whose farms extend to the shore—engage in dual livelihoods on both land
                        and water. Among the
                        islanders and in the northernmost bailiwicks: Troms, Vesterålen, and Lofoten, agriculture is
                        minimal, but in the
                        remaining and most fjords, it is of enough importance to provide half, and in Helgeland,
                        three-quarters of their
                        sustenance.

                        In all of the northern lands, approximately 50,000 people live, according to my estimate based
                        on church records. The
                        population has increased significantly over the last twenty to thirty years, leading to the need
                        to divide large
                        parishes that previously spanned multiple congregations. Many new farms have been established,
                        and the valleys have been
                        settled nearly up to the large mountain ranges.
                        <br><br>
                        The valleys of Vefsn, Nærøy, and especially Salten have forests of fir and spruce, used for
                        firewood and shipbuilding,
                        and it has been wisely prohibited thus far to cut timber for export, a regulation that must
                        continue to be upheld.
                        <br><br>
                        Livestock farming is generally important in the northern lands, especially in the valleys of
                        Vefsn and Nærøy, from where
                        butter, cheese, and meat are delivered to Drontheim and Bergen.
                        <br><br>
                        Since everything in the northern lands is coastal, there are fishing opportunities everywhere.
                        Large fishing events,
                        particularly at two locations, Nusfjord and Værøy in Lofoten, and in the fjord Folda in
                        Namdalen, take place in the
                        winter from February to April, drawing boats from all regions. At Værøy, over 400 boats, each
                        with a crew of four, may
                        gather together.

                            The author estimates the Northern lands to be 70 to 80 miles long, with a population of
                            50,000 people, which, according
                            to his calculations, had already increased by the time he wrote this essay and can thus have
                            grown even more up to the
                            present. Another piece of information I mentioned above attributes 26 people per square mile
                            in the Northern lands,
                            while Finnmark is attributed only 5 people, and yet, without any contradiction, these large
                            stretches of land were much
                            more densely populated in the 13th century. The whale fishery, the now-lost walrus, and
                            other fisheries were conducted
                            most profitably by the inhabitants at that time, and their trade extended to England and
                            beyond. This extremely
                            remarkable point from the description of the Finnish North will irrefutably confirm my
                            opinion about the population of
                            this area in older times. It is said that even before Harald Fairhair, the Finns had to pay
                            tribute to the northernmost
                            Norway. However, Harald demanded it for himself and appointed a lord over Halgoland and
                            Finnmark. The northernmost
                            Norwegians also had reindeer at that time, which the taxable Finns presumably had to tend
                            to. There were also
                            domesticated animals in the land, such as sheep, oxen, and pigs, although not in large
                            quantities, and they cultivated
                            the fields with horses. The walrus was then their usual food. Furthermore, Other, a
                            contemporary of Harald and a
                            resident of Halgoland, states that Norwegians have long gone to Finnmark for walrus hunting.
                            He himself was accustomed
                            to catching walruses, whose teeth were highly valued. In 10 days, he caught 60 walruses,
                            each typically measuring 48 to
                            50 ells long. The Saga of Olaf Tryggvason also mentions that north of Halgoland, many spent
                            time hunting and walrus
                            hunting. This was a great help for the armies and farmers, and one could also become wealthy
                            from it. This walrus
                            hunting has now ceased in all of the Northern lands and Finnmark, which, according to this
                            information, could have
                            sustained armies. The question: why? is as unanswered as the question: why is there no
                            attempt to revive it?
                            <br><br>
                            However, it is undoubtedly the nature of the impoverished situation that prevents this large
                            and advantageous fishery
                            for a maritime state from being pursued along these coasts. To improve and restore this
                            situation must be the greatest
                            focus of our days.
                            <br><br>
                            The Welsh and the associated walrus and stockfish hunting, as well as the sea trade of a
                            maritime state like Denmark and
                            Norway, must be regarded by the government as a very essential and important aspect of
                            trade. No branch of maritime
                            trade attracts bolder and better sailors—sailors whom no other in the world can match, let
                            alone surpass. England knows
                            this great advantage of the state all too well; thus, the state grants all possible
                            encouragements to make this branch
                            of trade even more perfect. The realm that, by virtue of its location, can and should
                            initiate its sailors and coastal
                            residents into these secrets is—Denmark.

                        As for harbors, one does not need to search far in the northern lands, given the abundance of
                        islands and straits.
                        Meanwhile, the island of Dønna in Helgeland, located between the mouths of the Nærøy and Vefsn
                        fjords, appears to be the
                        most convenient location for the establishment of a town.
                        <br><br>
                        This extensive district relies on the cities of Bergen and Drontheim for the sale of its
                        products and for purchasing
                        necessities. Although I am not entirely familiar with the content and scope of the privileges of
                        these cities, I do know
                        that northern yachts are required to load and unload in one of these harbors, and foreign
                        vessels, which sometimes
                        appear in northern waters, are discouraged by the local trade officials, even though preventing
                        this is not entirely
                        feasible.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether this arrangement is legally required or not, it is, in fact, the reality that all trade
                        in the northern lands is
                        directed toward Bergen.

                        They conduct only minimal trade with Drontheim, even though this city lies over 50 miles closer.
                        This is partly because
                        the bay leading to Drontheim significantly delays ship traffic and partly because the
                        Northerners are less certain of
                        selling their goods there than in Bergen. It is, indeed, true that while Drontheim’s trade is
                        stable and no location in
                        all the King's lands has such a solid economy, its commerce could certainly expand further if
                        its merchants were
                        inclined to speculate more, instead of restricting their business to their own district.
                        From Bergen, the closest parts of the northern lands are 70 miles away, while the farthest are
                        120 to 130 miles away.
                        Therefore, the Northerners from the southern districts usually make two trips to Bergen—one
                        around St. John’s Day and
                        the other around Michaelmas. Those from the northern regions only make one trip around the
                        latter date. At these times,
                        when between 100 to 200 northern yachts gather, especially in autumn, these gatherings in Bergen
                        are called the 'Spring
                        and Autumn Assemblies.'
                        The construction and rigging of the northern yachts are such that they can carry large volumes
                        of goods, such as dried
                        fish, but are not well suited to venturing far out to sea, requiring them to stay close to the
                        coast. As a result, their
                        journeys can sometimes be slow.

                        On such a trip to Bergen, one to two months of the short summer are spent, and during this time,
                        the land misses several
                        hundred of its best men, which significantly harms agriculture and farming at home.

                        The most significant part of the northern products consists of fish, a commodity that
                        deteriorates significantly with
                        any delay in handling and marketing, while the price is increased by the number of hands through
                        which the goods pass.
                        <br><br>
                        Consider the time and detours involved before northern fish reaches foreign markets. For
                        example, when the owners of a
                        boat with four men return home from the fishery near Roest and Bern in Lofoden, which takes
                        place from Candlemas to
                        Easter, they must sell their caught goods, which are to be converted into money, to a local
                        fisherman who is often the
                        only one nearby, at whatever price he sets. The goods remain in his warehouse until June, when
                        he heads to Bergen. His
                        journey is not the quickest; as mentioned, the boats do not venture far into the sea. Once he
                        arrives in Bergen, the
                        goods must be unloaded and loaded onto trading ships, and thus the fish caught in February
                        finally makes it to the
                        Baltic markets by the end of July or August. The same applies to fish caught in summer, which
                        experiences even less
                        delay.
                        <br><br>
                        Compare this with the practices of the Dutch in their herring fishery. The northern herring is
                        certainly as good as the
                        Flemish; however, I do not receive northern herring in Copenhagen until November. It has been
                        reported that Bergen's
                        fish has been declared 'bruised' (spoiled) in Danzig, and it is easy to see how this can happen.
                        However, it is crucial
                        that Norwegian fish remains in good condition in the Baltic, as the competition from Sweden
                        becomes significant, and
                        sales to France, Spain, and the Mediterranean diminish greatly or are entirely lost during the
                        resuming fisheries in
                        Newfoundland.
                        <br><br>
                        I have elaborated on the harmfulness of time loss in handling fish products and briefly
                        indicated the detrimental
                        effects of time loss that the inhabitants suffer regarding their other domestic economy.
                        However, one can easily ponder
                        this matter further.

                            <b> Agriculture and Fishing in the Northlands</b>
                            Under which agriculture and farming at home suffer greatly. Professor Fabricius explains
                            this quite evident harm to the
                            state when he elaborates on the brief account of this author in his journey to Norway. He
                            writes: The Northland
                            fishermen have small and large yachts, ranging from 50 to 80 loads, which look particularly
                            impressive, as they stack 8
                            to 10 boards on the sides of the ship and load everything between these and the mast with
                            fish products; since the fish
                            products take up more space than they actually weigh.
                            <br><br>
                            These are indeed burdensome journeys for them, as they must travel about 100 miles to reach
                            their destination. They can
                            make no more than two trips a year, missing out on the majority of the best summer time, as
                            a large number of
                            experienced people have to spend this time on these journeys. Sometimes they also have the
                            misfortune of damaging their
                            yachts on these trips, as the northern coast is so dangerous due to the many shoals and
                            cliffs, and the crew is often
                            inexperienced. Therefore, for the Northern lands in general, and especially for the
                            reception of the northern fisheries,
                            a town or landing place in the northern regions of Norway would be of great importance. I
                            know well that there has long
                            been talk of this, although it has never come to fruition, as it would completely contradict
                            the privileges of Bergen.
                            Bergen, which almost exclusively controls the fish trade, would certainly suffer greatly,
                            losing its wealth and
                            reputation entirely, as it has no other source of livelihood. On the contrary, such a newly
                            established town would have
                            the best effect on the Northern lands. Fabricius, Journey to Norway, p. 303. The testimony
                            of these two men, von Oeder
                            and Fabricius, both of whom cannot easily be dismissed in their good insights for the
                            benefit of the state of Denmark,
                            has at least borne fruit, in that according to public news, the establishment of a town in
                            the Northern lands has made
                            some progress, though the location proposed by von Oeder has been discarded. As for how far
                            the establishment of this
                            new town has come, I have not heard anything more about it in my corner of the world.

                        From both considerations, the necessity of a city in the northern regions becomes clear. Even if
                        we limit our focus to
                        this part of the extensive Kingdom of Norway and its own immediate needs in the establishment of
                        such a city, this area
                        is already large enough and sufficiently blessed by nature to support the existence of a city
                        within its borders. It is
                        only reasonable to provide the inhabitants with the advantages of a close connection between
                        agriculture and urban
                        industries. The number of inhabitants is already quite considerable, has greatly increased in
                        memory, and would further
                        increase with the enjoyment of these advantages.

                        Now I must, before proceeding further, declare my conviction regarding the justice of providing
                        the northern regions
                        with a city. In advance, concerning the anticipated objections against this northern city, I
                        want to express that, in my
                        view, the kind of objections drawn from the privileges of existing cities are of little
                        significance. Indeed, because
                        they aim to prove too much, they actually prove nothing except the truth that exclusive
                        privileges are of no value.

                            I do not consider it unnecessary to compare the state of Bergen, as presented by Professor
                            Fabricius, with the author's
                            opinion. He writes about Bergen as follows: — The city's sustenance consists solely in
                            maritime trade; it is its only
                            source of livelihood. Without products, without supplies from the land to support their
                            trade, they have managed to
                            appropriate the greater part of the northern fish trade, which constitutes the largest and
                            almost the only industry of
                            the city. Every summer, the inhabitants of the Northlands, the Sundmøre islands, and almost
                            the entire coast bring their
                            dried fish, train oil, and similar goods to Bergen on many large yachts, which are then
                            exported from here all over
                            Europe. They, in turn, provision these yachts with grain and other foreign goods, which they
                            bring back with them. For
                            Bergen, this arrangement is of utmost importance, and it enriches itself at the expense of
                            the Northlanders, who are
                            compelled to transport their fish on a long and arduous journey. They miss out on a large
                            part of the best summer season
                            during these journeys, and the benefit of exporting their own goods to foreign countries is
                            also lost. But —

                        My intentions go much further than just the northern regions alone; for I am of the opinion that
                        this northern city
                        would be the best location for our Icelandic, Faroe Islands, and Finnmark trade, and it could
                        serve as the seat of a
                        entrepôt trade with Archangel. And all this together would provide enough commerce to establish
                        a city.

                            Unfortunately, Bergen does not even solely enjoy the benefits of this arrangement but almost
                            shares them with all other
                            nations. Few of the goods brought to Bergen are exported by the local merchants for their
                            own account and with their own
                            ships; instead, the Dutch, English, Swedes, and other nations take the largest part of these
                            fish goods, carrying them
                            to their own countries or to the Baltic or Mediterranean for their own profit. Because of
                            this, the nation loses not
                            only the benefit of shipping and freight (for which northern shipping has noticeably
                            declined in recent times) but also
                            the commercial gain with distant nations. Furthermore, these foreign ships bring back all
                            kinds of goods that Norway
                            needs, especially grain, thus earning double freight. This makes a considerable difference,
                            as Bergen supplies not only
                            the surrounding region but almost the entire coast with grain. It would therefore be highly
                            desirable to find a way to
                            boost our maritime trade and secure this gain in commerce and transportation of our own
                            goods for the nation.
                            <br><br>
                            So far, Professor Fabricius. This focus on our maritime trade could be achieved by
                            establishing a new city in the
                            Northlands. As far as I am aware, the professor had accurate information on this long before
                            Oeder's proposal was
                            submitted. However, it seems that the professor chose not to mention Oeder's proposal here,
                            possibly because it was
                            deemed best to leave Oeder’s contributions in their former obscurity, for reasons unknown.
                            <br><br>
                            According to this description of Bergen, it does not follow at all (for what the professor
                            says about the disadvantage
                            Bergen might suffer from such a state-beneficial city is merely, as he often expresses, an
                            impulsive discontent) that
                            with the establishment of a new city in the Northlands—and, should the state wish, another
                            in Finmark, as the professor
                            suggests elsewhere—Bergen would completely lose its wealth and status. The trade only needs
                            to become more native to
                            Bergen and wrested from foreign hands so that Bergen can remain a prosperous city without
                            draining the resources of the
                            inland and Northlands.
                            <br><br>
                            If the merchants are encouraged to focus on foreign markets and to accept a more modest
                            profit than they have so far
                            drawn effortlessly from the poor and truly burdened Northlanders, and if they are willing to
                            endure a bit more effort
                            and commercial hardship, then the trade stimulated in the Northlands will bring them more
                            profit than loss. The
                            Northlanders will still maintain trade with the Baltic Sea, even if, with future ships, they
                            can reach the open sea. In
                            this way, Bergen can still serve as the main depot for their goods. But what the merchants
                            of Bergen lack is what the
                            author also observes of the merchants of Trondheim, and indeed, what the entire kingdom’s
                            merchants lack—true
                            enterprise.

                        The location of the northern regions provides a natural basis for all these intentions.
                        Finnmarken begins where the
                        northern regions end and is essentially just one and the same stretch of land extending to the
                        Russian territory. Small
                        and larger vessels can conveniently make the journey to Archangel several times a year along the
                        coast, and Russian
                        ships often come to the northern regions, engaging in a trade that is very pleasant for the
                        inhabitants, albeit
                        contraband trade with Russian goods, especially flour. The distance between Bergen and the
                        northern regions is quite
                        small, and this distance is completely negligible against the previously mentioned delay of
                        Norwegian fish products
                        before they arrive in Bergen and from there.

                            As far as I know, it is a principle that there should be freedom in trade, such that
                            everyone, whether native or
                            foreign, is entitled to trade in any goods they wish. This fortunate principle prevails
                            fully in England, yet each
                            trader must also submit to established trade laws; for an excess of freedom in trade does
                            not make the state prosperous
                            and does not benefit commerce either. Following England's example—as undoubtedly the
                            greatest commercial nation—and even
                            emulating it, seems to me something that cannot harm any nation, especially those whose
                            geographic situation has so much
                            in common with it.
                            <br><br>
                            With these principles in mind, I will venture just a thought in passing, merely a thought.
                            For many years I have never
                            quite understood—nor do I yet understand—why in our realms, trade between Iceland, Norway,
                            and Denmark, and between
                            Denmark and the German provinces, is so severely restricted. Regarding the German
                            provinces...
                            <br><br>
                            (page 126-127 is missing)
                            <br><br>
                            A trade can be beneficial to individual citizens, but still be clearly harmful to the nation
                            or state as a whole. This
                            is surely the evident case with the two cities of Bergen and Trondheim, with respect to
                            commerce and the improvement
                            through increased population of such a splendid area—an area as richly cultivated in earlier
                            times as the Northlands and
                            Finmarken. Moreover, this restrictive control is merely an apparent benefit to these cities.
                            What they gain, the state
                            loses in double measure. Trading cities should gain from foreign lands, not exclusively from
                            their own country with
                            which they are fraternally bound. This should, in the truest sense, be the ultimate goal of
                            both cities if they wish to
                            truly promote the well-being of the whole.

                            The harm suffered by the Northerners in terms of their domestic economy, which indeed every
                            conscientious patriot must
                            criticize, in light of this forced trade, has been fully exposed by Professor Fabricius in
                            his northern travels. I must
                            repeat it: if the inhabitants of Bergen and Trondheim, as true patriots, consider the
                            welfare of the whole rather than
                            that of a few individuals, they should not behave like the Jewish merchants of Danzig in
                            1400, when thick darkness still
                            veiled the North, and one could justly quote Voltaire’s words:

                        It is known that before the establishment of the city of St. Petersburg, most maritime trade
                        with Russia was conducted
                        via Archangel, and that this trade has partially, but not entirely, shifted since then. The main
                        reason for this is that
                        the voyage to the Arctic Ocean is only open for a small part of the year and requires large
                        ships and equipment for
                        profitable travel. However, if there were a location in the northern regions designated as a
                        depot, I firmly believe
                        that Russian goods would be eagerly collected from there by other nations and distributed by the
                        Norwegians themselves,
                        in turn providing the Russians with European goods at a profit. It is well known how easily
                        winter affects the supply in
                        the Russian Empire, and that, for this reason, most goods from the interior of the empire can
                        reach Archangel just as
                        easily as they can reach St. Petersburg.

                            wealth, the virtue of governing, to make a stretch of land spanning so many miles, which has
                            so far languished under the
                            iron restraint of our privileges from ancient times, happier than it is." Would you not
                            marvel at such patriots? Men of
                            Bergen and Trondheim, be Norwegians.

                            What is further said by the author about Iceland indeed bears the seal of truth, and, if I
                            judge correctly, since the
                            government is earnestly striving to support the still very unfortunate Iceland and to
                            provide all possible assistance,
                            then the author would likely have been able to contribute with his knowledge and experience
                            even in those times. He
                            should have been employed, but why he was not used has remained a mystery amid the many
                            changes that occurred soon after
                            the proposal was submitted. Nevertheless, it could have been enough for the author that,
                            even though removed from Danish
                            service, he saw that his proposal to establish a city in the Nordlands was, in a sense,
                            taken seriously by the
                            government, bringing him some satisfaction.
                            <br><br>
                            I am further tempted, before I conclude, to add a few thoughts on population growth in
                            states where it is needed. This
                            is truly a way to make great, benevolent, and lasting conquests without bloodshed. The
                            internal strength of the state is
                            its true aegis. What did Frederick, the great man of Prussia, do? One reads:
                            <br><br>
                            According to a not overly exaggerated estimate, this all-encompassing spirit, Frederick the
                            Unique, has built over 500
                            villages and settlements and established around 45,000 families on new grounds. Calculating
                            five people per family, the
                            state thus gained an increase of more than 215,000 people. Through considerable sums that
                            the king either gifted to many
                            nobles and landowners or lent at 1 or 2 percent (with these interest payments allocated as
                            salaries for rural
                            schoolmasters or pensions for the widows and daughters of poor officers), they were enabled
                            to cultivate and improve
                            their land and establish colonies on it. The great king has separated more than 400 farms
                            and estates from his large
                            domains and districts and given them as hereditary leases to various types of farmers.
                            "This," says Mr. von Herzberg,
                            "is one of the best and fastest methods to promote population growth, as the more people are
                            fed, the smaller and more
                            divided the properties are." Should it be shameful to imitate the great Prussian?
                            <br><br>
                            The yield of properties, says another writer, Mr. L. A. von Soden in his Cameralistics, is
                            driven much higher when the
                            estates are divided than with large estates, and at the same time, the population grows, and
                            with it, consumption
                            increases in equal measure. But, he concludes, as long as the wealth of the state is not
                            properly distributed, as long
                            as one does not know how many people one has to oppress, as long as fields lie fallow, as
                            long as chambers are filled
                            with jurists and profit-makers, no good and purposeful outcome can be expected. Whether the
                            man is right, the reader
                            must judge.

                        Iceland is originally a Norwegian colony, and it always seems to me most natural that the
                        daughter would adhere to or be
                        directed by the mother. Copenhagen is, after all, too far from being a trading post for
                        Icelandic commerce; all company
                        trade inherently yields fewer advantages than private hands do. However, Iceland is akin to
                        Peru, and all closed trade
                        places restrictions and obstacles in the way of human endeavor and enterprise. I know that
                        sympathy for the Icelanders
                        is the reason why people are concerned that the inhabitants would suffer from a lack of grain
                        and other necessities if
                        there were a free trade without any obligations to supply them. But is this concern justified
                        enough, and does one not
                        genuinely harm the Icelanders by depriving them of the benefits arising from competition,
                        ensuring them safety from
                        starvation but also keeping them in a constant state of poverty? They are compelled to accept
                        all prices of outgoing and
                        incoming goods, along with the amount of outgoing goods, which depends solely on the discretion
                        of the buyers. The
                        trickery of the Dutch, with which they occasionally deal with Iceland, is in my view evidence
                        that something must be
                        done. It is certain that one cannot know what Iceland is capable of until a free trade allows
                        the industry of the
                        inhabitants to fully flourish; at least no money can circulate among the inhabitants as long as
                        all their trade consists
                        of a constrained barter of goods in kind, making it unlikely that liquidation ever occurs to the
                        point where they would
                        receive a surplus paid in cash. The attempt to determine to what extent Iceland could be left to
                        the fate of free trade
                        will always be considered dangerous, and I do not deny that caution must be exercised in this
                        matter. However, one could
                        first free one or another port and maintain a small supply depot for the king’s account in
                        readiness for emergencies,
                        should trade and supply not meet expectations. In my humble opinion, this would be the greatest
                        and most beneficial
                        service the king could render to his subjects in Iceland.

                            I conclude with the wish that the compassion for Iceland, indicated by the author of the

                            its editor, may soon be subject to a beneficial change. In the conviction that Iceland must
                            still have many unknown and
                            very advantageous opportunities for trade, I am also sincerely content with the hope that
                            Iceland may, in time, shine
                            like a precious pearl in the crown of the Danish monarchs, fully realizing this, as soon as
                            the One who holds the
                            balance of the growth and decline of kingdoms in His hands may will it.

                            Iceland and other unfortunate
                            lands, which have sighed and still sigh under the abhorrent yoke of merchant governments,
                            has hopefully given the world
                            sufficient warnings. They have not even spared their subjected peoples from the horror of
                            famine. Rather, they have
                            caused this plague.

                        However, let them say what they will, and whether trade with Iceland may remain free or closed,
                        it seems to me that
                        Norway, and especially the Northlands, are more convenient as its seat than Copenhagen. This is
                        because communication is
                        closer, the distribution of Icelandic products is easier directly from the North Sea rather than
                        first to Copenhagen and
                        then away from there, and with less risk for the perishable Icelandic products. Furthermore,
                        Iceland can be supplied
                        from Norway, but not from Denmark, without excessive costs with essential goods, specifically
                        timber for houses and
                        fishing boats. The same can be said to some extent regarding iron.

                        One might ask me how Norway, particularly the Northlands, which must purchase grain themselves,
                        could supply Iceland.
                        But the answer is simple, namely through trade, just as Holland, which cannot satisfy even a
                        tenth of its population
                        with its own crops, still has bread for other nations. This is what makes trade advantageous:
                        the ships that export
                        products must always bring something back home; and in the speculations that profit encourages
                        merchants to engage in,
                        as it teaches them to invest in grain storage, a country like Norway always finds a ready means
                        for emergencies,
                        provided that it costs the merchants’ neighbors a little more.

                        Finnmarken, as mentioned, constitutes a single land and coastline with the Northlands, and the
                        trade with the Faroe
                        Islands is of the same nature as with Iceland, and thus the same considerations apply regarding
                        the trade. However, I
                        must make a note about this coastline from Drontheim to Vardehuus: that in the event of a war
                        with Russia, the entire
                        coastline is exposed to attack by the galleys from Archangel, which cannot be effectively
                        defended against with warships
                        but requires a similar armament. Therefore, along with the proposed northern town, a fortified
                        galley harbor should be
                        established.
                        <br><br>
                        I have stated that the main focus of this town should be on trade with Archangel, and we must
                        not overlook the Swedish
                        Lapmark that borders the Northlands along its entire length. After all, there are four, albeit
                        small, Swedish towns on
                        the western shore of the Bothnian Sea, engaged in this trade with the Lapps, and how much easier
                        it must be for a town
                        on the North Sea to provide these people with the goods they desire, especially since the Lapps
                        are present on the
                        Norwegian side in the summer.

                        If the project of establishing this town in the Northlands were ever to be realized, the area
                        around the mouth of the
                        sea bays, Rauen and Wessen, would deserve special consideration, and in general, when choosing
                        the site, attention
                        should be paid to a good harbor and the proximity to the better cultivated districts of the
                        country. The already
                        existing scattered yacht skippers and so-called burghers or merchants would immediately
                        constitute a considerable number
                        of families as a foundation, and soon the necessary professionals would arrive. It is likely
                        that merchants from some
                        other towns, for example, Christiansund, which is too close to Drontheim, and from Bergen, as
                        well as traders from
                        Copenhagen, would seek to try their luck in this new city, where it becomes difficult for them
                        to thrive among the more
                        established families. The Finnmark trade would have to be completely relocated there, and the
                        Icelandic and Faroese
                        trade would partly follow. Finally, if one were to consider a entrepot trade with Russian goods,
                        this new town would
                        have to be made a free port, which would undoubtedly attract the factories of the Hanseatic
                        cities, the Dutch, and the
                        English.

                    <br><br>
                    I am assured that we cannot expect any enduring establishment of our military system unless the
                    King allows his Civil
                    and Military Ministries<br>
                    1) to work on it in concert. I still hope that Your Excellency will
                    <br>
                    2) find an opportunity to guide the matter in that direction.

                            In those times and from the year 1763 onward, one could reliably sing in Denmark:
                            <br>
                            Ministers patch up the State,<br>

                            Doctors patch up hands and

                            Oh, Jobsen! Oh, Jobsen! what do you patch up?<br>
                            You patch up the ministers, judges,
                            doctors, and teachers, torn
                            shoes.<br><br>
                            They patch and often patch poorly,They patch and patch incorrectly,And tear what they still
                            try to patch,The good
                            back into pieces.Oh, Jobsen! Oh, Jobsen! what do you patch up?You patch with skilled
                            hands?The shoes of all kinds of
                            people,So very tightly.
                            Around this time, a supplement from the then-Prussian minister von Bork to the Danish court
                            with assistants also fell
                            into my hands. Since it does not seem to have become particularly well-known, I had no
                            hesitation in adding it to these
                            reflections. It deserves to be shared with the public. It is said to come from a man who
                            remained in negotiation with
                            the Danish court until his death.
                            <br>
                            These reflections, which are now shared with the world, come from the pen of a man who, as
                            he himself admits, was not a
                            professional. Yet, the author sincerely wished to help with the patching. His good
                            intentions, therefore, are more to be
                            praised than criticized, and I must admit that in his essay, one finds far more good,
                            useful, and applicable principles
                            than in many other essays, which, under the grand title of “by a distinguished officer,”
                            have been trumpeted to the
                            public.

                        In this matter, there are many things to consider, and it is precisely in the fact that the
                        various considerations,
                        which need to be examined and combined, have not been weighed from a unified perspective, and
                        that actions have been

                        the measures taken since
                        1763.<br>

                        benefit for the truth from oral conferences, especially between people who still need to agree
                        on principles.

                            So, my intention is actually not to criticize. The author deserves no criticism; for what he
                            has written, he has
                            committed to the pen with the best of intentions and for sound reasons. I only wish to
                            mention what seems different to
                            me; and that includes the author's first assertion:
                            <br><br>
                            That no establishment of military organization would be expected to be firmly grounded
                            unless the King of Denmark had
                            his civil and military ministries working on it jointly.
                            <br><br>
                            Why not? Let the military budget be set directly by one or more perceptive officers
                            experienced in their field and
                            especially knowledgeable about the entire country, and the entire organization will surely
                            become a true military
                            budget. The King and his actual State Council must consider only the whole and not the
                            parts. The civil minister will
                            always, in the correct and immutable principles, bring about a stable military budget to its
                            perfection, lacking
                            sufficient experience with it, and often wavering on principles that must be applied
                            strictly. In general, I am not at
                            all a supporter of mixed commissions, a reality that the author himself came to understand
                            more significantly than
                            desired over time.

                            However, it probably doesn't need to be proven that, in the times when the author wrote his
                            essay, the establishment of
                            the military budget was not conducted by those working on it in a way that corresponded to
                            the nature of the matter and
                            the situation of the kingdom, as there was too much meddling involved.
                            <br><br>
                            One must have a true understanding of the great St. Germain if one wants to gain a proper
                            understanding of the
                            frequently changing arrangements of that time. One must also not forget certain men who may
                            have, with all likelihood,
                            misused the trust he may have placed in them, given that he was completely unfamiliar with
                            the country and its
                            constitution. I have been reliably informed of the following details about this unusual man
                            by a high-ranking officer
                            who served under the count in foreign services and, until shortly before his departure from
                            Denmark, also served with
                            pleasure in Danish service, valued his talents, and even brought him, in some measure, into
                            Danish service, though he
                            could not praise his recent actions.
                            <br><br>
                            Count St. Germain was the son of a nobleman from Franche-Comté, who was a colonel of a
                            regiment of militia—certainly not
                            a son of Emperor Charles VII. In his youth, he was educated by the Jesuits and trained as
                            one. As a second lieutenant,
                            he got into trouble during the war on the Rhine in Strasbourg, over which he had to leave
                            French service. Prince Eugene
                            assigned him to his nephew. He became a dragoon officer and a captain during the Hungarian
                            War. When in the first
                            Silesian War in 1741, the future General Buccow, who was then a younger captain than he,
                            became a major (if I’m not
                            mistaken, due to the surprise of Cosel), St. Germain left the Austrian service, and
                            Seckendorf, who had known him in
                            Austria, appointed him as a major or lieutenant colonel in the Oettingen Dragoon Regiment,
                            where I first met him in
                            1743. He was often used in detachments. He made a successful retreat through Bavaria. In
                            1744, when we marched back to
                            Bavaria, we took Donauwörth together. St. Germain commanded the main attack, and I led ten
                            grenadier companies forming
                            the second attack.

                            We besieged Wasserburg. I was to lead this siege under the Prince of Hildburgshausen. St.
                            Germain, who was detached with
                            a corps, crossed the river at night, and the enemy had to retreat hastily, which made it
                            easier for us to take
                            Wasserburg, which the enemy abandoned. Shortly thereafter, he captured Burckhausen. A fine
                            enterprise. He commanded
                            during the winter at the border; I commanded the infantry under him. We captured
                            Reichenhall, where I remained in
                            command, and I had the posts on the Salzburg and Tyrolean border under my orders. In the
                            spring, the enemy attacked the
                            Hessians, who had the left wing, and scattered them, after which we retreated. The army
                            converged at Landshut. St.
                            Germain and his corps gave the others renewed courage. He made a fine disposition, and we
                            captured Landshut. Throughout
                            this entire war, he served with great distinction, and I was very pleased to serve under
                            him. Our friendship was very
                            strong during this and the following times and remained until the time when I drafted the
                            document you are now seeing
                            concerning his crazy projects regarding Norway. A commission set up, which even included v.
                            G., had to unanimously agree
                            with me. This did give me free hands in Norway, but now Count St. Germain became my sworn
                            enemy: he fell for the first
                            time, and yet I was good-hearted enough to faithfully help him so that he returned to power
                            in 1767. Count R. and Count
                            G. gave me their word of honor that if I would help that St. Germain be reinstated in his
                            lost position, then v. G.
                            would not be used again, and I would keep everything in Norway as it must be. St. Germain
                            himself saw that he was in the
                            wrong. Hardly three days after he was back in charge, v. G. was called again and suggested
                            to me to carry out the crazy
                            projects, etc.

                            The reduction of the two fine cuirassier regiments of Zealand and Oldenburg was the
                            beginning and equally unforgivable.
                            Even stranger was the reduction of the newly established hussar regiment. It was the first
                            regiment of this kind in
                            Denmark. The persistent rumors suggested that this reduction occurred solely because the
                            Count hated its colonel, von
                            Trimbach. It was a poor initiative in critical times when light troops are indispensable to
                            any army, to immediately

                            they were stripped of all their military supplies, and it was finally heard that the entire

                            incomparably organized, was to be abolished, even half of the fleet sold to France, the
                            patriot no longer knew whether
                            the entire state was being turned upside down or whether there was an intention to eliminate
                            it from the list of states
                            in Europe. If these projects had also flowed from the brain of the man whom the aggrieved
                            writers assumed, no impartial
                            person could still say what title this man could be honored with as a native, even in his
                            grave. It is unbelievable.
                            Enough, Count St. Germain may have always been a good, brave soldier and a worthy general in
                            the field, but in peace, he
                            was certainly no general for Denmark; this will remain an eternal truth. The state rid

                            better because of that? This question is thoroughly answered in this writing when its author
                            says: I would advise anyone
                            who has to do with this to put their thoughts on paper, because I do not expect any benefit
                            from oral conferences,
                            especially between persons who should still agree on principles, hardly—compatibility.
                            <br><br>
                            But how will the civil and military state come to an agreement on established principles
                            under the still prevailing
                            circumstances? I say once again, under the still prevailing circumstances, never. Since the
                            man from the civil state,
                            due to his excessive weight, looks at and considers a man of the military standing with
                            entirely different eyes. The
                            author did not need to be a prophet to think that no compatibility could be hoped for. It is
                            not to be hoped for, and
                            precisely for this reason, the form of the war budget should also be determined solely by
                            experienced, practical
                            military personnel, and not by any mixed commission, which will never be able to unite. What
                            the author says about his
                            contribution and other efforts can be assumed to be true and correct, and it was commendable
                            that he also wanted to use
                            his strengths and insights for the good of the whole. Whether he received a reward for this
                            remains unknown to me; fame
                            was enough for him to have meant it well and thought truly patriotically.

                        the contradiction than this: that one can be a very good general in the field and yet establish
                        an organization in

                    In our state, the military estate is so intertwined with the civil estate as in hardly any other
                    European state.
                    Presumably, our generals rely on the axiom that one must trust a man in his field of expertise, and
                    with this, they mean
                    to justify excluding our civil ministry. However, this axiom should never be extended beyond
                    questions that can be
                    decided solely on the grounds of science.

                            Wishes that are surrendered to the air are indeed free. Thus, our states, as they are now,
                            should be defended from the
                            Elbe and Trave up to the tip of Jutland.

                            A land force like we need, along with a fleet, cannot be maintained on a recruited basis,
                            the author states somewhat
                            vaguely, for the fleet has nothing to do with recruitment at all. For the protection of the
                            country, he calls for 70,000
                            to 80,000 men and believes that Denmark, with all its might, can hardly maintain 20,000
                            recruited soldiers, concluding
                            correctly that these 20,000 men could neither help fully nor partially.
                            <br><br>
                            We must, therefore, first consider closely how our land forces should be structured; this
                            should be our primary focus.
                            <br><br>
                            In an essay shared with me in 1778, the entire Danish land force is noted to consist of
                            78,015 men in peacetime. I will
                            now briefly point out that according to this plan, the cavalry in both realms should consist
                            of:
                            In Denmark and the duchies: 10,830 men.<br>
                            In Norway: 6,337 men.<br>
                            In Norway: 4,490 men.<br>
                            Thus, the Danish cavalry, in the year 1716, saved the realm from a significant threat;
                            Frederick IV alone had such a
                            cavalry on Zealand, which made Czar Peter I reconsider his thoughts of leaving Zealand. It
                            was 12,000 men strong. The
                            State Councilor Christian Frederick of Holstein offered to bring the entire Russian force
                            under the king’s control
                            within two hours using this excellent cavalry. The late Count von Ranzau zu Aschberg's idea
                            was that Denmark should not
                            undertake anything offensively given the present state of affairs. Our cavalry would always
                            serve as bait to foreign
                            powers to engage with Denmark, as long as it was not neglected. Whether this thought is
                            entirely valid, I shall leave to
                            statisticians and politicians to judge.

                        military affairs to the state as a whole. Even the King of Prussia, who is both king and
                        commander, cannot avoid this
                        order of thoughts. He must first consider the state of his country, the course of world events,

                        of the state, and determine the purpose and goal of his military force—how large it should be,

                        In 1763, when I saw that our Military Ministry sought to separate itself from its connection
                        with the Civil Ministry, I
                        immediately became concerned about the consequences that could arise from this and have since
                        feared other outcomes as
                        well. I shared my concern with Mr. Justice Counselor L. … I said to him: 'A status in statu (a
                        state within a state)
                        will arise—an eccentric whirling force that will revolve around its own axis, rather than around
                        the common center of
                        the state constitution.

                            According to the aforementioned plan, the infantry without artillery in Denmark and the
                            duchies would consist of 34,954
                            men,Norway without artillery would consist of 29,122 men,thus totaling
                            64,076
                            men,and as the author elaborates later in his thoughts, he wishes that the majority, and
                            hardly more than 20,000 men,
                            would be recruited from nationals.
                            Furthermore, our author states a little earlier: We must seek the necessary forces within
                            the nation itself. The
                            national troops must be the main force, while the recruited ones should be a secondary
                            force. Our generals should
                            demonstrate their skill in this and seek their merit for the state by utilizing the national
                            troops, drawing on the
                            resources that nature has bestowed upon us, to do everything possible, while also accepting
                            what can be done when one
                            cannot do what one might wish.

                            All this would indeed be very good, but in my opinion, the author, in adopting this
                            principle, did not consider the
                            population of our state or at least did not account for any war.

                            Assuming our army stands, as he suggests, on the footing that the national troops outweigh
                            the recruited ones twofold,
                            the country can peacefully dedicate them to service and the state in peacetime. However, if
                            we were to engage in war, it
                            might take on a completely different appearance, especially under the current state of
                            affairs. I will make only one
                            observation. I am very familiar with a district of two hordes in the duchy of Schleswig,
                            measuring about 6 to 7 miles in
                            length and breadth. This not insignificant district has, among those registered for service,
                            14 to 36-year-old land
                            committee members, rarely or perhaps never more than 400 men. Whether it should have or
                            could have more is a demand that
                            does not fall to me to decide. How much manpower can such a district yield annually, without
                            the population suffering
                            noticeably?
                            <br><br>
                            Let’s assume that only 50 men march in the first campaign. Whether the campaign is bloody or
                            not, it is always
                            devastating, and of those 50 men, hardly 30 will return fresh and healthy. How will it look
                            when another 50 men are to
                            be deployed in the third campaign, considering that no account can be taken of those
                            registered at 14 years of age?
                            Miserable. This observation has been overlooked by the otherwise well-meaning author, who
                            has only considered the army
                            in peacetime as his focal point, and for other reasons, he could not make this point. And
                            how would it appear in such a
                            region, where there are already a shortage of necessary hands, if the war were to last only
                            four years, regarding
                            agriculture? Miserable.
                            <br><br>
                            Now the author continues and believes that the generals must demonstrate their skill in
                            forming the national troops, and
                            that the proper formation of national soldiers costs nothing but the diligence of the
                            officers and the will. Here, it
                            seems to me that the author demands something from the generals that they cannot achieve,
                            nor should they be expected
                            to. How and when are they supposed to demonstrate their skills with the nationals? It is a
                            must, a thing that cannot be
                            changed, that the national soldier be present as little as possible with the regiment, or in
                            his military service in
                            general, during peacetime. The general cannot show his talents until the great maneuvers.
                            Under the current and quite
                            necessary regulations, the national soldier is only assigned to train with the regiment for
                            17 days in the spring; what
                            can he learn in 17 days? Marching, wheeling, and performing the necessary maneuvers are all
                            that can be expected from a
                            young farmer in this time. In these exercises, the skill of a general cannot be
                            demonstrated, but rather the skill of
                            subordinate officers up to the rank of colonel can shine. It seems to me, however, that it
                            would be far more advisable,
                            as it was in the past, to have the land committee member exercise diligently every Sunday in
                            his parish, instead of just
                            wandering around on Sunday afternoons, visiting the tavern, and perhaps playing bowling,
                            especially in the summer. There
                            is still plenty of time to enjoy oneself in the tavern. Every spring, before the necessary
                            fieldwork begins, the
                            battalion commander could seek to instill his skill and discipline into the battalion, and
                            by the third year, the
                            battalion could be integrated into a regiment, and then during the maneuvers of an entire
                            corps, first through the skill
                            of the generals, could be set in motion for the execution of large tactics. This would be my
                            suggestion.

                            the will of the proprietors
                            equally present? Are the conditions of the committee members always such that, even if the

                            that the author would like to set for Denmark at 45,000 men can be summoned immediately? In
                            the study room, many things
                            seem easy, which, when put into practice, present insurmountable mountains before one.

                            One must be somewhat acquainted with recruiting; otherwise, one can be instructed very
                            differently. Often, in two or
                            three areas, there is not a single eligible man for service. How this misfortune arises, and
                            whether it can be remedied,
                            is certainly another question that does not belong here. However, assuming the troops are
                            available, the state should
                            not provide for them; rather, they should provide for themselves. How can the officer
                            demonstrate his diligence when the
                            land soldier stands under arms for only 17 days in the entire year and is not often taught
                            how to handle the weapon?

                            the state and the fatherland will not detract from the law in the least; and thus the
                            subaltern officer could show his
                            diligence and skill in fulfilling his duties, forming good national soldiers and true
                            defenders of the fatherland.
                            Moreover, he forgets, along with the national soldier, what they should actually be

                            also provide 45,000 men, which I, without much calculation, assume to be correct, and that

                            duty from serfs? Were the
                            world conquerors under Alexander, under the Romans, Scipio, and Caesar serfs? Hence, I
                            cannot agree with the subsequent
                            conclusion he makes from Norway to Denmark until serfdom is completely abolished both in the
                            kingdom and in the
                            provinces, and the free man with his acquired property willingly and freely submits to the
                            Danish scepter, just as the
                            Englishman can kiss it.
                            <br><br>
                            I have known since the year 1762 that Norwegians are inflamed with patriotism when we
                            actually rushed to confront the
                            approaching Russians with complete seriousness. Ten sick men from the recruited regiment
                            Sydenfield did not want to stay
                            back in the quarters and wait for their recovery; instead, they hastened their deaths during
                            the night marches and early
                            movements. But I recall an old man who had been a slave in Algiers for 14 years, who, after
                            recounting his rather
                            unfortunate experiences there on a noble estate in the duchy of Schleswig, concluded his
                            narrative with a deep sigh:
                            "What more is there? In Algiers, I was a slave, and here, at the age of 70, I am still one."
                            The humanity of the noble
                            gentleman, as the owner of the estate, was certainly not his greatest virtue. Whether a serf
                            can think passionately of
                            love for the fatherland is a question that those who particularly defend serfdom in our
                            realms and lands might answer.
                            Therefore, the author states without ambiguity: "The obligation to defend the fatherland,
                            which is imposed on every
                            farmer in Norway and recognized by all, is not stronger there, nor weaker in Denmark and
                            Holstein. It can only be
                            recognized there." But can a peasant, who already trembles at the mere mention of the word
                            'soldier,' recognize it? Does
                            he take pride in saying, like the Norwegian: "I am a King's Croat?" In certain conditions,
                            one can be taught entirely
                            differently if one wishes. Yet, patriotism is a Proteus; it often changes its true form.

                            The connection between the military and civil state in Denmark should have been reasonably
                            proven to be unbreakable.
                            However, that the economy, especially when operated solely by the civil state, can cause a

                            non-military principles, is demonstrated all too well by the French armies during the Seven
                            Years' War. One can also
                            find enough examples of such in the Danish army. In 1711, due to a wretched economic
                            arrangement of the war
                            commissariat, the entire campaign was lost because the artillery intended for the siege of
                            Stralsund could not be
                            shipped. In the campaign of 1762, an old officer was sent from a regiment to retrieve
                            ammunition as per the orders

                        A consistently sound plan is based solely on the coherence of truths and their intrinsic value.
                        It requires not only no

                            Why, then, in Denmark alone, are these two estates so intertwined that neither can achieve
                            anything without the other?
                            This cannot be easily explained, and the writings in which these entanglements are somewhat
                            developed have likely either
                            not been read or, if read, did not make the impression they should have. Despite the
                            author's modesty, it seems to me
                            that he is very inclined to attribute to the civil estate the power to solely shape the
                            military estate, and for this
                            reason, one could indeed use the axiom he presents here against himself.
                            <br><br>
                            In the establishment of the military estate, one must place more trust in the man of the
                            craft than in the man of the
                            pen. A Herzberg would willingly yield the leadership to General Möllendorf in a similar
                            case, and both are equally
                            beneficial to the fatherland, and both can receive the highest degree of trust from their
                            monarch. In this case, it
                            appears that the author's reasons seem somewhat forced. However, I will leave the judgment
                            on this to the reader.
                            Suffice it to say that I am convinced, from experience and from very compelling reasons,
                            that the man of the pen,
                            without having first been a soldier himself, will never be particularly qualified to benefit
                            his state in the
                            establishment of the military estate.
                            <br><br>
                            What the author relates regarding the measures a king should take with or without counsel
                            concerning his military power
                            are good general rules, which, however, do not seem to be properly applicable to the
                            circumstances of the time. The
                            Danish army was there. It had maintained itself strongly enough to confront a true and
                            bitterly hostile adversary
                            without foreign alliances and connections with other powers. The storm (thanks be to
                            caution!) had passed. The truly not
                            insignificant army came from Mecklenburg, having had no hesitation in confronting the enemy
                            until then. The monarch
                            could know how his military power should be. He must also know where to obtain money and
                            people in the future.
                            Therefore, the question was not whether the army should be increased; that was not
                            necessary. However, it seemed to me
                            that the question was whether it could be advantageously reduced without losing our
                            previously held weight in the
                            balance of European states. As the author later shows, unfortunately, it was reduced to such
                            a degree, not to the honor
                            of the state, that even the nation, and one could not blame her for it, became restless with
                            these very noticeable
                            innovations.

                        It is always offensive to the public when ministers cannot hold differing opinions without one
                        or the other being
                        removed; this leads people to conclude, quite rightly, that personal influence rather than
                        reason prevails.
                        <br><br>
                        In all matters within the military establishment, an especially high level of animosity has been
                        all too evident; the
                        overly common forceful mentality of the military mindset has shown itself, which can be
                        beneficial when facing the enemy
                        but ruins everything in peaceful deliberations with fellow citizens. It is inappropriate to
                        always say, "It must work"
                        when the question is whether an arrangement is suited to the nature and circumstances of the
                        country. Nature cannot be
                        forced, and one must not forget that the King's reputation and authority are always more or less
                        compromised in such
                        cases if it is invoked as proof rather than through reason. Such argumentation is offensive to
                        anyone who would never
                        presume to doubt the King's authority.

                            noted as an anecdote, which in itself does not warrant further consideration. However, I
                            find many causes and reasons to
                            doubt whether the intentions of Count St. Germain and his favorite were indeed to establish
                            a status in statu. It was
                            always very noticeable to me and to many others, endowed with a bit of common sense, that
                            neither Prince of Hesse, Duke
                            of Brunswick, Generals Count Ahlefeld, nor Count Schmettow, to whom one could attribute very
                            useful military talents and
                            a thorough knowledge of Norway, were utilized in any regard. Of the latter, a foreigner
                            wrote from the metropolis in
                            1778: "You are right, my friend! This man should be used. But for what purpose? He is
                            entirely a soldier, commands
                            willingly; wants to prescribe laws and instruct others who do not wish to be taught. So off
                            with him. He will remain an
                            author and will be forced to wait for this profession, albeit not in his true sphere." I
                            have also had the opportunity
                            to see and read many useful memoranda and proposals from Count Ahlefeld for the benefit of
                            the poor, especially
                            regarding their support. He was placed in Oldenburg, in a post that was the opposite of him,
                            and his truly good and
                            beneficial proposals were probably never considered.

                            The birth of all these innovations during these times seems to me to have had a completely
                            different origin, and I do
                            not want to hide my opinion on this. If I am mistaken, then I am not the first to err in
                            matters that still lie hidden
                            under a thick fog and may perhaps not be brought to light until the third generation. It
                            seems to me that this is how it
                            is.

                            Let Count von Bernstorf speak on page 55 in his Apology. He, not exactly the best choice for
                            a finance minister in those
                            very money-consuming times, was no Sully, but far more a Fouquet. He was—yet those who know
                            him better and some of his
                            confidants, some of whom may still wander this earth, can praise his merits to posterity,
                            not I. Enough, the Apology of
                            Count von Bernstorf clearly states that under his stewardship, the finances of the realm
                            fell into great disorder.
                            Indeed, not the best posthumous reputation.

                        1) The National Army must be the primary focus.
                        2) With the enlisted troops alone, we may try as cleverly as we like, but nothing will be
                        accomplished.
                        3) There is an immense difference in the relationship between the king and his servants, and
                        that
                        between a private person
                        and their servants. The king’s absolute power, which is not usurped but entrusted, is more
                        securely founded on the
                        subjects’ sense of duty than on any other support.
                        4) For us, there is no need to focus on internal security when establishing the military system,
                        but rather to concentrate
                        more on external threats.
                        Regarding the first three points, it seems to me, Your Excellency has been led to waver.

                            In the year 1762, the empire had fallen into great debt, and one wanted and needed to save.
                            Following a long-established
                            and commendable practice, which had made the predominance of the civil state a habit, the
                            army was once again the true
                            corpus delicti. It, along with the two lower estates of the empire, was supposed to bear the
                            burdens of it, while the
                            nobility contributed nothing, and the clergy very little. Enough, to save on the army would
                            therefore be the beginning,
                            even if it meant facing its destruction. Whether Count St. Germain did not see this, could
                            not see it, or did not want
                            to see it; whether his favorites abused his trust, or he was blinded by weakness, can be
                            left to that. Enough, to see
                            the military state nearly transformed into a non-entity was not a new but rather a
                            long-accepted state principle of
                            those in power, who still found it very useful and worthy of imitation to maintain the
                            fathers' ways from the year 1648,
                            even though entirely different noble families had done so. As hidden as these principles
                            might have been from the
                            public, they were nonetheless directed by invisible superiors, even if St. Germain and all
                            those who thought differently
                            opposed them, such that they could not escape the trap set for them. Invisible powers rule,

                        to the entire world on
                        its own soil, and I am further firmly convinced that any nation, as long as it is populous
                        enough to be called a nation,
                        can maintain such independence.
                        <br><br>
                        However, it must also adhere to the system of militis perpetui (perpetual military) that is
                        common in Europe. It must
                        not rely on its enlisted standing troops alone for its defense.
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, as I intend to contest this system, I will, to avoid excessive detail, focus solely
                        on the inadequacy of the
                        militis perpetui system for defense, without delving into other domestic inconveniences of this
                        system, such as the fact
                        that state revenues never suffice, or that militis perpetui provides an endless source of many
                        of Europe’s wars, and so
                        forth.
                        <br><br>
                        I must expect objections from both the civilian and military sectors. The former will be
                        addressed in future notes;
                        regarding the latter, I ask that, at first, we remain focused on the question of where our
                        manpower should come from,
                        until we can consider the question of its quality.
                        <br><br>
                        I do not wish to enter into a formal investigation of this system, which is flawed in so many
                        respects across all
                        European states. I simply state that, even if it were acceptable in all other states, it does
                        not suit ours, and I ask
                        only this of its defenders: how do they expect us to feel secure under it?
                        <br><br>
                        Should we not dread sharing Saxony's fate? Even with the aid of the mightiest allies, it
                        remained in the enemy's hands
                        from the first moment until the end of the war, from 1756 to 1762.
                        <br><br>
                        Have we nothing to hope for from a national army? And if we have no other recourse than our
                        handful of mercenaries,
                        should we then even pretend to have an army?
                        <br><br>
                        If, however, it is possible to raise 30,000 national troops in Norway and just as many in
                        Denmark and the German states,
                        alongside 15,000 to 20,000 enlisted men; if a system is beneficial in which we can proportion
                        resistance to attacks by
                        leveraging national forces, then we can consider ourselves an independent state, and under such
                        a system, we might
                        expect to remain free from attack, whereas our weakness would otherwise serve as a natural
                        invitation for one.
                        <br><br>
                        One does not easily attack a fully armed nation, but certainly one that relies on 20,000
                        unreliable mercenaries for its
                        defense.
                        <br><br>
                        The defenders of militis perpetui should not resent those who love the king and the land if they
                        do not readily or
                        easily accept the assertion that nothing can be accomplished with a national army. Empty claims,
                        after all,
                        prove—nothing.

                            One circumstance seems to have escaped the author of the essay, or he did not want to notice
                            it: that Count St. Germain,
                            according to the previously inserted message, was once completely removed from activity. Did
                            things get better during
                            this interlude, or when he was reinstated? The changes did not stop when the Count truly
                            left the state; and when they
                            will gain more stability, we must wait patiently, because the best indication that it will
                            happen is present. Enough
                            that one does not always have to attribute everything that has happened in these times to
                            the Count St. Germain, as can
                            be observed more closely; much that was laid at his door does not always need to be blamed
                            on him. The web that
                            surrounded him was too intricately spun to be discovered. Was not the god of war once
                            captured as well? Everything the
                            author tells us in paragraphs 3 and 4 is more than true, and can hardly be said to be more
                            than: it was thus.
                            <br><br>
                            The army in Denmark, which had beautifully returned to its quarters in 1762, was nearly
                            nonexistent by the year 1767.
                            The provisioning, the recruitment—everything had been placed on a different, and
                            fundamentally far more expensive
                            footing. Whoever had seen the cavalry regiments that were still left, as they had been, and
                            saw them now, had to shut
                            their eyes and—be silent.
                            <br><br>
                            Why the Nordic National Army should also be destroyed will likely not be deciphered or
                            resolved by any Oedipus to this
                            day. The worthy Count of Schmettow received the Nordic National Army with the loss of the
                            local command, which was
                            entrusted to the subsequently even more remarkable Count Ranzow of Aschberg, under whose
                            command, as Pastor Wilse
                            informed the public, all that Schmettow had contributed for the benefit of the local
                            military met its blessed end. This
                            one too was soon called back to the metropolis to play an even larger role. In a word, in
                            these times every estate, but
                            especially the military state, was indeed most outstandingly subject to changes; and for
                            this reason, the author rightly
                            asks: What is the whole plan for all of this supposed to be? And what it has been will
                            likely never be determined after
                            so many years.
                            <br><br>
                            It is always unfortunate, as the author laments in paragraph 6: When the great ones in the
                            state make it their sole
                            endeavor to displace each other, bring each other into disrepute, and where possible,
                            suppress one another. This always
                            indicates that such a change will never lead to the better but will likely cause greater
                            confusion. However, whether the
                            author, who here seeks to impose a particularly harmful animosity against the civil state
                            upon the military state,
                            because he always seeks to tilt the balance toward the civil state, has viewed this
                            completely impartially, I will not
                            decide, but I cannot admit it for my part either.
                            <br><br>
                            The animosity existed in both states, and in the civil state for a long time. The changes
                            certainly did not end when
                            Count St. Germain left Denmark. This has been known as well by the author as by anyone else
                            who might observe it, and I
                            will thus rightly, at this very delicate point, place my finger on my mouth like Hippocrates
                            and—be silent.
                            <br><br>
                            However, when the author states in paragraph 7: In regard to the first three seats, it seems
                            to me that Your Excellency
                            is shaken: it seems to me that he would have wanted to attribute the direction of the whole
                            matter to the minister. And
                            that would be too much power and authority entrusted to a single person in the State
                            Council. In general, it seems that
                            the author is very inclined to believe that the military state should nonetheless ultimately
                            regard the civil state as
                            its legislator, and once this happens, one knows what fate awaits it in every state.
                            Examples should not even be used
                            here. The small dispute with Steinhorst can, for those who are somewhat informed about those
                            times and the events as
                            they were conducted, speak very convincingly of how the military state was constituted under
                            the wings of the civil
                            state. </i> </p>

                        I would wish that, with the present considerations, more thought might be given to our naval
                        power—at least for the sake
                        of example—than perhaps is currently done. The history of all our wars and the services rendered
                        by the fleet
                        demonstrate the remarkable and reliable performance of a force drawn from the nation itself,
                        especially in comparison to
                        foreign mercenaries. The example of the naval forces also generally shows the feasibility of
                        relying on our own
                        resources within the land forces, if only the parallels are not overlooked.
                        <br><br>
                        The fleet, along with its equipment and all things that cannot be obtained on short notice, is
                        kept ready, while only a
                        moderate corps of sailors remains in steady service. Meanwhile, the remaining sailors necessary
                        to man the fleet sustain
                        themselves and train on merchant ships until the state calls upon them in an emergency.
                        Similarly, with respect to the
                        land forces, we must have officers, fortresses, and artillery prepared, maintaining a moderate
                        corps of enlisted troops
                        in constant service, while obligating the peasantry—who sustain themselves in peacetime—to serve
                        in emergencies, and
                        training them beforehand so that they are capable of action when the need arises.

                            I want to adopt the sentence that the author assumes in paragraph 8: that any nation, as
                            long as it is numerous enough
                            to be called a nation, can assert its independence at home. However, much more could still
                            be said about this.
                            <br><br>
                            But when the author further states: A nation must remain in the usual system of a standing
                            military, but should not rely
                            on its recruited standing troops for its defense. Quite right. Denmark can certainly
                            maintain its independence with a
                            well-equipped fleet and 70,000 land troops. However, it depends on how many recruited troops
                            should be placed alongside
                            the national army. In my opinion, the least would be half, and thus, instead of the author
                            only placing 20,000, it
                            should be 35,000 men. This number would be the least that the state would necessarily need
                            to maintain consistently from
                            foreigners without being too harsh on its native children.
                            <br><br>
                            When the author continues by saying: Raising 45,000 natives in Denmark and the provinces
                            would cost nothing but—will.
                            When he adds: The natural obligation to defend the homeland, which is imposed on every
                            farmer in Norway and acknowledged
                            by all, is not stronger there and is not weaker in Denmark and Holstein. One can only
                            recognize that. I have already
                            answered this thought above and have demonstrated the difference in the mentality of the
                            people in both realms quite
                            clearly.

                        If we can defend the border, a war from that side cannot last long, and we must not be reluctant
                        or regretful if we do
                        even more than necessary to repel the attack with certainty and extinguish the fire at the
                        outset. However, if we cannot
                        defend the border, the war might also not last long, but the state would be forced to make peace
                        on any terms, and we
                        must recall the years 1629 and 1658.

                        Should we wish to continue the war, how infinitely more difficult would this not become if the
                        mainland part of the
                        kingdom, from the Elbe to the Kattegat, were already in enemy hands. One must consider the new
                        way of waging war, where
                        the natural resources of the defeated state are turned against itself; remember the fates of
                        Saxony and Mecklenburg. The
                        Swedes fought the Thirty Years' War not with their own kingdom’s resources but with Germany's
                        own weapons and forces.

                            The author now seeks to dispute the system: that a miles perpetuus, particularly composed of
                            recruited soldiers, could
                            and must protect Denmark according to the system adopted by Count St. Germain at that time.
                            <br><br>
                            Among the inconveniences of this system that he cites is that the state revenues in the
                            country would be insufficient,
                            and that the miles perpetuus would be an incessant source of wars. Whether this opinion is
                            to be accepted as entirely
                            certain may well require further clarification. However, since we are speaking only of
                            Denmark, brevity here is also
                            appropriate.
                            <br><br>
                            The author now anticipates objections, both from the civil and military states. Before he
                            wishes to address these, he
                            only requests to remain at the question: Where are the funds to come from? Indeed, an
                            important question.
                            He then claims that, even if the miles perpetuus were agreeable for all states, it would be
                            of no use for Denmark in
                            regard to the recruited soldiers. He asks, quite reasonably and insightfully: Should we not
                            dread the fate of Saxony in
                            the Seven Years' War? Do we have nothing to hope for from a national army? He formulates it
                            from 30,000 Normans, 30,000
                            Danes and provincials, and 20,000 recruited foreigners, and holds that Denmark is now strong
                            enough, given the good
                            condition of the fleet, to assert the independence required of it. He tells the defenders of
                            the recruited miles
                            perpetuus outright: Decrees prove—nothing.
                            <br><br>
                            That in no state the revenues suffice to maintain the recruited miles perpetuus is a problem
                            which the establishment of
                            the Prussian state and its millions without debt sufficiently contradicts. Whether the miles
                            perpetuus is still an
                            incessant source of wars cannot be claimed with certainty, as has already been said. 300,000
                            men against another 300,000
                            more seasoned troops will not easily draw their swords, and if they do, peace will soon
                            return, provided that the
                            superiority does not prolong it as it did in the Seven Years' War. This truth has been
                            sufficiently demonstrated and
                            confirmed by the last Austro-Prussian War and through the Treaty of Teschen. Therefore, both
                            statements remain only
                            assertions and conjectures. However, all of this is only a side note.

                        up to 90,000). In short: the defense must be proportional to the emergency and deployed at the

                        fully armed nation can accomplish this. If fewer hands need to be taken from the plow, so much
                        the better; but what
                        prevents us from ensuring these hands are also accustomed to securing a weapon?

                            However, the author now poses the very important question for Denmark: Where are the hands
                            for a national army to come
                            from? This question will be answered further down. It should also be investigated why the
                            miles perpetuus is utterly
                            unsuitable for Denmark.

                        A corps of 15,000 to 20,000 standing troops is indispensable to meet the needs arising in
                        peacetime, to execute
                        government orders, to occupy fortresses, to serve as a training school for officers, and as a
                        model for the troops that
                        are not constantly under arms. I certainly believe it is better for these standing soldiers to
                        be foreign recruits
                        rather than native citizens, as the latter, if left to the plow and their other tasks, bring
                        greater benefit to the
                        state and overall profit than the cost of maintaining standing troops. However, whether the
                        standing troops are
                        foreigners or natives, we can only keep a moderate number, which is insufficient for defense.
                        So, when the need for
                        defense arises, what shall we do? Recruit as many men as we need, as quickly as possible. How
                        should this be managed?
                        Without even considering what we will do with these men, who we neither need nor can afford to
                        keep on salary once peace
                        is restored. Thus, it follows that if we maintain standing troops for regular use, we must also
                        have a national militia
                        prepared for extraordinary needs and defense. In such cases, it is no longer valid to say, “Our
                        citizens are too
                        valuable to be taken away from their useful and profitable work for the state.” No, for the
                        defense of the homeland, no
                        citizen is too valuable, and since we cannot afford nor obtain enough foreign hands, let us use
                        our own.

                            Furthermore, the author asks: Should we not be alarmed by the fate of Saxony? It seems worth
                            taking some time to
                            consider this question. I would like to ask again: Was Denmark in the situation of Saxony in
                            the years when this essay
                            was discussed? Was it so before? And I must answer quite clearly: not in the slightest, and
                            never before either. If one
                            were to ask again: Does Denmark stand in its current relationship with the powers of Europe
                            as Saxony did between
                            Prussia and Austria since the year 1740? I would again answer: No. If further asked: Can it
                            happen in the current days
                            of Europe that Denmark finds itself in the situation of Saxony? Then I would have to answer:
                            Yes, if it is not very
                            careful and fortunate; and if that case were to occur, which is to be wished against, one
                            cannot foresee all things and
                            avert them in time, then the author is entirely right that the use of 20,000 to 30,000
                            recruited soldiers would not be
                            enough to avert the same fate as Saxony's. However, in this case, since it only exists as a
                            possibility, it is not the
                            place to elaborate further, and I wish to leave this thought from the proposed essay for the
                            reader and the politician
                            to ponder.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, the author takes on a somewhat satirical tone when he asks: Do we have nothing to hope
                            for from a national army?
                            And he adds—if we have no other consolation than our little band of recruits, then we must
                            not give the impression that
                            we have an army. And that is indeed a bitter but undeniable truth.
                            <br><br>
                            The author now turns to his main idea. This is to combine 20,000 recruited soldiers, 30,000
                            Normans, and 30,000 Danes
                            and Holsteiners as nationals into the same, thus forming an army of 80,000 men, which would
                            then secure the state's
                            declared independence without dispute with the well-equipped fleet, and would be protected
                            from all attacks with such a
                            constitution.
                            <br><br>
                            For the sake of example, the author rightly mentions the fleet and its victories, and proves
                            through them his assumed
                            principle of forming the greatest part of the power of the state from the inner and entirely
                            own strength of the nation.

                        And why should nothing capable come from the national army? I will not dwell on the greater
                        reliability and loyalty of
                        the national troops, which is hardly disputed, nor on the question of skill. I assume that we
                        place good and competent
                        officers with the national forces and accept what I have always heard from military experts:
                        that it depends more on the
                        officers than on the common soldiers, who can easily be shaped by the former. This must
                        necessarily be the case. For an
                        army renews itself during war in just a few years through recruits who mostly come, raw and
                        untrained, from the plow to
                        the rifle. The essential point is that the common soldier is accustomed early to discipline,
                        subordination, and basic
                        drills. This is, or should and could be, present in our national soldiers. Precision and polish
                        are less essential and
                        do not make the soldier. Whatever may be lacking in terms of maneuvering skill for the national
                        troops while they are in
                        their cantons can soon be made up for when the regiment is assembled and spends a period
                        training daily like the
                        standing troops. After all, we are unlikely to face a sudden attack without any warning,
                        allowing us time to prepare in
                        advance. Furthermore, when we consider that a large part of the standing army undoubtedly lays
                        down its arms for the
                        majority of the year — certainly five-sixths of the year — the question arises: Couldn’t the
                        weekly drills of the
                        nationals, assuming they are not performed superficially, be considered equivalent to the
                        exercises of the standing
                        troops during their training season? The practice that actual war provides for both officers and
                        common soldiers is
                        inevitably missing in a country that enjoys long periods of peace, whether for standing or
                        national troops. It is left
                        to the officers of both types of troops to make up for this deficiency through sound theoretical
                        knowledge and by making
                        use of opportunities that may arise in foreign states during times of war.

                            Just as stated, we must, in regard to land forces, keep officers, fortifications, artillery
                            on standby, and a modest
                            corps of recruited troops on constant pay, while obliging the peasant class, which sustains
                            itself in peacetime, to
                            service in case of emergency, and before the emergency arises, to train so that something
                            can be accomplished with them
                            then.

                            This principle of the author cannot be easily dismissed, although some difficulties may
                            arise in Denmark's current
                            situation. As long as serfdom, so to speak, has not been completely eradicated and
                            eliminated, and the term itself is
                            preserved in the language in Denmark and the provinces, the peasant cannot be obliged to
                            military service as in Norway,
                            according to the nature of the matter. However, this hindrance may, as the patriot can hope,
                            be removed: yet it will
                            still come down to how the peasant, before the emergency arises, can be trained to
                            accomplish something with them, as
                            the author demands. These measures must be taken into consideration by those concerned, so
                            that they are in the interest
                            of the country. It is good advice from the author.
                            <br><br>
                            To merely want to defend the border might be a plausible principle; at least it was not the
                            principle of our generals in
                            1762. What should have been clarified further by the author is the idea of finishing the war
                            soon, rather than doing too
                            little, or, conversely, too much. However, what he says further does not require new
                            explanations to be added. History

                        Whether the difference between standing and national troops is fundamentally as small or as
                        large as it may be, our
                        generals must strive to make it as minimal as possible. And if they know no other way to secure
                        our affairs than with a
                        standing army, then they are not the right generals for us. For we cannot maintain a sufficient
                        standing army for them,
                        and they must not expect us to believe that they can defend us with just 30,000 men.

                            The organization of the army is quite good; however, I would wish, for my part and according
                            to my imagination, for
                            50,000 combatants in the field. Never should, again according to my small imagination, a
                            reserve corps from Norway be
                            sent into the German provinces unless in the gravest necessity. I will concede that the two
                            recruited regiments could,
                            if circumstances allow, be withdrawn from the realm; but for heaven's sake, no nationals.
                            1,000 nationals in Norway are
                            as good as 3,000 in the southern provinces of the realm. Their courage, loyalty, bravery,
                            and activity remain the same,
                            but not their health. It would be far more advantageous in these regions to use money.
                            Certainly: if there is only
                            enough money, people needed in war can always be found. But the nerve to conduct the war
                            must not be cut off.
                            <br><br>
                            The author remains in § 12 still adhering to a favorite but truly quite false idea: that
                            20,000 recruited troops with
                            60,000 nationals would be entirely sufficient to protect the realm. However, he has left
                            much that needs to be
                            considered unaddressed. Let it be. We have this force just as he wants it. Wanting to defend
                            ourselves first at the
                            border would be the most harmful principle in the world. Thus, in order to defend ourselves
                            well, we must seek to
                            confront the enemy as far beyond our borders as possible, and to this end, a decisive battle
                            is unavoidable. Now suppose
                            we strike with 50,000 men; we defeat the enemy, or we are defeated: it is the same.
                            <br><br>
                            At the end of the campaign, we can always reasonably assume that we have lost 15,000 men.
                            How shall these be
                            replenished? From the reserve that remains in the country. Good. Another campaign, fortunate
                            or unfortunate, yields the
                            same amount of loss. Where, then, does the necessary replenishment come from? If the author
                            had wanted to take a closer
                            look at the not entirely settled Austrian war with the Turks in Hungary! Austria has 300,000
                            men. Even as I write this
                            (in 1788), no decisive engagement has occurred; and how does it look with the conscription?
                            Does it not seem that there
                            is already a shortage of men to the point that they are arming Jews? This defensive war
                            recommended by General Lacy,
                            according to his cautious genius, can no longer turn out to be advantageous for the Emperor.
                            Belgrade and Widdin should
                            have been in the hands of the Emperor before the arrival of the Grand Vizier. The defensive
                            war against Frederick II,
                            the victor at the Battle of the White Mountain, was indeed necessary in Bohemia; but here
                            one must fairly say: it is not
                            always the same. Anyone who wants to read and know more about this war, I refer to the
                            translated Polybius, with Folard
                            and other craftsmen's remaining observations.

                        Without a doubt, they have had opportunities, especially in the last war, to observe many things
                        worthy of imitation,
                        but nothing is unconditionally worth imitating. Prussia and Austria, which do not have a fleet,
                        cannot be our models.
                        France would undoubtedly have done better if it had focused more on its naval power rather than
                        its land forces. What
                        some German princes have done for foreign pay does not apply to us. Britain’s example deserves
                        our imitation the most,
                        ceteris paribus.

                        Britain has waged its wars in Germany with foreign troops in its service, but it has established
                        a national army for the
                        defense of its own island. I am very much in agreement that we should also employ foreign troops
                        during wartime, leaving
                        our nationals at the plow as long as foreign troops can be had for money and we have the funds
                        to pay them, i.e.,
                        because this is too uncertain, and the preservation of the state requires a more secure
                        foundation, we must have a
                        national army.

                        I repeat what I have always heard from experts in the art of warfare: that the formation of a
                        good army depends
                        primarily on the officers. Thus, I cannot reconcile this with the reduction measures, which are
                        primarily directed
                        against the officers. Many worthy individuals are clearly being placed in difficult
                        circumstances through no fault of
                        their own. Those who are retained remain in constant fear of suffering a similar fate, and
                        consequently, the desire and
                        love for the profession, which otherwise accomplishes so much good, must disappear.
                        <br><br>
                        If we are to form an army in the future, where will we quickly find officers after a few years,
                        once those currently on
                        pension have gradually passed away? I am not even speaking of good and devoted officers, but
                        simply of a necessary
                        number. Therefore, if a reduction for the sake of economy must be made, the officers should
                        still always be retained,
                        while a portion of the common soldiers could be let go, provided that a national army is in
                        place.

                            With the author's permission, I must add this: Not all wars are fought as one imagines them
                            in the study. How long could
                            we wage war with our citizens if, according to the author's principle, no citizen is too
                            precious to defend the
                            fatherland, which I readily concede? If the author had paid more attention to the population
                            of the state, he would not
                            have regarded this idea as possible. However, when he says: because foreign hands are
                            neither sufficient in number for
                            money (this remains an unresolved question) nor can they be paid by us (that would indeed be
                            bad), let us at least use
                            our own; he can see that with the weak population of our realms, and since Norway need not
                            be sacrificed in any southern
                            war, the recruited troops have indeed always been necessary since the reign of the king who
                            first needed recruited
                            peoples, and they will always be necessary in the current weak population, as has been often
                            said.

                        The main errors in the organization of the National Army on the old model lay in the fact that
                        officers who were once
                        assigned to the Nationals were kept there for life. To be placed with the Nationals meant, at
                        least in Denmark and the
                        Duchies, essentially to be retired or sidelined for life. When an officer thus settled among the
                        peasants, he would
                        easily become like a peasant himself, growing indifferent to his profession, becoming overly
                        familiar with his
                        subordinates, and neglecting his duties due to economic considerations.
                        <br><br>
                        However, this fault could easily be remedied without overhauling the entire system and relying
                        solely on the
                        mercenaries. Service with the Nationals should be established as a path for promotion, one that
                        all officers would be
                        required to follow. Promotion could proceed by staggered transfers from the mercenaries to the
                        Nationals and then back
                        again, as they prove themselves in each role with the Nationals.
                        <br><br>
                        When the common soldier’s obligation to serve is set to 15 years, as it was previously in
                        Norway, this period can be
                        divided into three five-year periods. In the first five years, he would serve as a recruit; in
                        the next, as an active
                        soldier; and in the final years, he would serve as a reservist. In the final year of his active
                        duty, he can be
                        transferred to a mercenary regiment, where he would perform garrison duty. Suitable common
                        soldiers among the
                        mercenaries, or those among the Nationals who wish to spend the final year of their soldierly
                        service, like the last of
                        their recruitment, in a garrison with a mercenary regiment, can be promoted to non-commissioned
                        officers.
                        <br><br>
                        The National soldiers must be mustered and trained diligently, regularly drilled within the
                        parish, and occasionally
                        assembled as companies and regiments for maneuver exercises. For the inspection of the
                        Nationals, inspectors should be
                        appointed yearly from the directorate, but they should not be permanent. If, in this way,
                        officers devote constant
                        attention to the formation of the National soldiers across all ranks up to the inspector level,
                        and the training is
                        conducted earnestly at times that are most manageable for the peasants and not merely for show,
                        it is hard to understand
                        why a National regiment should not be as well-trained as a mercenary regiment, which usually
                        allows a large portion of
                        its men considerable leave for most of the year.
                        <br><br>
                        There is much more to add in detail, but I will refrain from doing so, as I am not an officer,
                        and it would be too
                        lengthy to cover. I will only say that in Denmark and the German lands, as well as in Norway,
                        several National Dragoon
                        regiments should be established.

                            The proposals made by the author in § 13, contrary to the formation of a national army, are

                            and any tradesman who is not biased will find them worthy of no reproach. However, when he
                            states that elegance and
                            propriety are less essential, there is no consensus on this matter. In peacetime, elegance
                            and propriety are indeed
                            necessary to maintain well-trained troops, and experts will concede that the apparent
                            pedantry in the initial formation
                            of the Prussian army under Frederick William I laid the groundwork for the subsequent
                            perfection of the army when it was
                            truly needed under the command of Frederick the Great. Whether the national soldier, who
                            only trains with his rifle for
                            17 days a year, could be equated to the recruited soldier, who, according to the author's
                            calculations—which might not
                            be entirely accurate—spends 5/6 of the year with his rifle, may well be considered very
                            problematic by those skilled in
                            the trade.

                            comes straight from the heart. However, he should not have said "our generals." Only Count
                            St. Germain wanted to protect
                            the state with recruited troops, not our generals, who, as previously shown, especially the
                            patriotic Count von
                            Schmettow, were well aware of how much Denmark needed a national army. Our other generals
                            living at that time could
                            therefore have been good for us, as they were not consulted about what Count St. Germain had
                            done or still wanted to do.
                            <br><br>
                            What the author further says about the completely incomprehensible reduction at that time is
                            entirely correct. If Count
                            St. Germain had not had a penchant for reduction, as he soon showed when he became Minister
                            of War in France, there
                            would have been much more to say about the reduction in Denmark than can reasonably be
                            conjectured now. What did he
                            occupy himself with as Minister of War? With nothing but—reducing.
                            <br><br>
                            What the author says about the officers in the national army must and will be approved by
                            any skilled tradesman, even if
                            it is just a layman's perspective. His advice regarding the non-commissioned officers,
                            inspectors, more frequent
                            exercises, and gatherings will likely face no significant opposition. It would not be a bad
                            idea to, with the soon-to-be
                            abolished serfdom, as it was during the times of Frederick IV, establish some regiments of
                            land-dragoons in Denmark and
                            the duchies, thereby putting our cavalry back on a glorious footing, as might be done in
                            Norway.

                            The lamentations the author raises in § 17 have also been echoed by others. I recall having
                            read a letter in 1778 in
                            which a friend commented on the maneuvers seen near the metropolis: "What I have seen is,
                            for sure, really of no value
                            at all." The inconsistent national soldier, who sheds his red coat at a moment's notice when
                            his proprietor wishes him
                            to, will never be a soldier, nor will he ever become one, and all the camps for him are
                            nothing but uninformative
                            exercises that incur great costs. For the officer, it is informative; but he is not the one
                            who defeats the enemy. In
                            short, this fundamental error will never yield finished soldiers, which can only be expected
                            after 6 to 10 years of
                            service, etc. In another letter, this same person expressed himself as follows: "I did not
                            observe the inspection with
                            much edification because the people, in marching past in a line of 25 men, could not even
                            keep step. I attended the
                            maneuver at Amack. It consisted of a siege that was as slow as that at Schweidnitz. I left
                            before the performance was
                            over. From the so-called great maneuver, which a court majordomo aptly titled, I saw
                            nothing. I am generally not very
                            much for schoolwork. The idea that raw people in wooden shoes can become soldiers in 17 days
                            and learn to march and fire
                            quickly is an affront to all human capabilities and all general experience. Moreover, since
                            the national soldier can be
                            taken away at any moment by his owner, his soldier's life is regarded as more of a burden
                            than a respectable profession.
                            Previously, the drunken peasant could be sought after by his lord; now that he is enrolled,
                            the state must treat him as
                            a runaway and return him to his master, always with the belief that he belongs to the state.
                            A clever economic plan! The
                            national, however foolish he may be, can become anything if given desire and time. However,
                            if he has the first, he must
                            absolutely lose it because he is exhausted in 17 days, and moreover, the desire to fight is
                            beaten out of him with the
                            stick, which he must feel, but he is not accustomed to the bailiff's whip. This is always an
                            infringement against the
                            necessary and honorable soldier's status, etc.

                        I estimate the population of Norway at 900,000, Denmark at one million, and the Duchies at
                        approximately 500,000. I am
                        firmly convinced that the ratio of population is the most natural foundation for military
                        organization. Just as the true
                        strength of a state, in every regard, lies in its population when properly utilized. Although
                        war and the defense of the
                        homeland certainly also require money, they primarily demand hands, which must be taken from
                        where they are and where
                        nature has placed them. Since it is highly unfavorable to seek the necessary number of hands for
                        the defense of the
                        state from outside the state, it is an indispensable duty for every part of the state to provide
                        the proportionate
                        number of hands for defense, and this should not be something that can be bought off with money.
                        <br><br>
                        The advantage of Norway’s structure, where the peasant class has always had a strong national
                        army and where our kings
                        could never assemble a substantial army without them, becomes evident in comparison to the
                        structure of the peasant
                        class in Denmark and the German states. In Denmark, as in all other desirable state reforms,
                        this unfavorable structure
                        of the peasant class—making up three-quarters of the nation—appears as an obstacle that hinders
                        all progress.
                        Incidentally, it should be noted that, if one compares arable land to arable land, Norway is
                        much more densely populated
                        than Denmark, and even more so than Schleswig and Holstein.

                            I cannot bring myself to think in accordance with this man, and I therefore believe that it
                            will be very good that after
                            the long-desired abolition of serfdom, the national soldier will necessarily be better
                            trained under the command of
                            skilled, dedicated officers, rather than, as it was in reality, behind negligent officers,
                            who, like all Sundays before
                            and after church services, exercised him. He could be trained far better than before, and as
                            well as the Nordic soldiers
                            could be. If the author prefers the population of Norway to that of Denmark and its
                            provinces, he must also concede to
                            me that it could still be better despite this. The insightful Count von Schmettow wrote, as
                            I have read myself, when he
                            took command in Norway to a friend: "Norway is an excellent and beautiful country that could
                            still become much better.
                            People are lacking in Norway, and my focus is primarily on increasing the population, for
                            which I propose a very simple
                            means: to allow an odels owner to divide his estate among three or four sons and to free him
                            and his children from
                            military service if he sets aside a place for a soldier. I do not demand a regulation, but
                            only a permission, which
                            would immediately promote 10 to 12,000 households in the first year. At another time, he
                            wrote to the same friend: 'I
                            must confess that I do not believe there can be a better land than Norway in the world.
                            There are areas here where some
                            farmers can grow grain, barley, or oats for 15 to 20 years in a row without letting the
                            field rest for a single year;
                            some do not even fertilize it, but simply alternate planting. There is much to be done here
                            if only the common man were
                            a little more diligent and the leaders had more desire to contribute to the common good. But
                            let’s not dwell on this;
                            such sentiments do not sound harmonious at all. Let the pedal rest.

                        This has created an essential difference, for all positive reasons, between the Norwegian and
                        the Danish or Holstein
                        national soldiers. The Norwegian farmer—whether he is the heir to his own farm, or a poorer man
                        trying to establish
                        himself on a leased farm—must serve a certain number of years, and in doing so, military service
                        becomes a path to
                        establishing himself. He turns necessity into a virtue and feels the weight of his duty less
                        than he values the honor of
                        his status. But the Danish and Holstein soldier? — Yes, this is well-known, and there is no need
                        to specify the
                        contract—
                        <br><br>
                        He would, however, think like the Norwegian if the obligation were the same for all farmers,
                        whether free or unfree, if
                        each had to go into the field and serve his designated years, should the occasion arise during
                        his time.

                            If the author is not unjustly claiming that no commune, when it comes to the defense of the
                            homeland, as is the case in
                            some marsh areas, can buy itself out with money, then it must nevertheless be the case that
                            this rule may have
                            exceptions in peacetime. It is well known that there is a significant shortage of hands in
                            the marshes. The solid land,
                            or the so-called geest, which sends workers to the marsh areas, always suffers in this
                            regard. Those born in the marsh
                            do not create much benefit on the geest. Their food differs greatly from the food in the
                            cities and the much leaner
                            geest. Just as those from the geest cannot tolerate the rich foods of the marsh dwellers,
                            which swim in fat like a
                            Moroccan roast chicken, and their almost indigestible beers, and are soon attacked by the
                            fatal marsh fevers; so too
                            would the well-endowed stomach of those born in the marsh suffer from the much gentler and
                            significantly leaner foods on
                            the solid land. Both types only thrive where their youth has passed, regardless of age.
                            <br><br>
                            In my humble opinion, a different arrangement could be made with the marshlands, to which
                            they could readily agree, and
                            I believe at least they would agree. The marsh dwellers naturally have a high spirit, and
                            through upbringing, they can
                            be formed into soldiers in peacetime and must gather into a corps in wartime and defend
                            their districts, being familiar
                            with the land. Such an institution in the marshes would have been able to achieve great
                            merits for the homeland,
                            especially if, as in the year 1762, it had been the case that an enemy could have landed
                            unexpectedly in the marsh while
                            the army was advancing against it. If these strong and soldier-born brave men were given
                            diligent officers, uniforms,
                            weapons, drums, trumpeters, and oboists, they would indeed perform admirably. What the
                            fathers could do, the living now
                            and in the future must also be able to do and accomplish.

                        Here is Rhodes, here is where we must leap. Without a doubt, our landowners in Denmark and the
                        duchies have as many
                        objections to the introduction of the Nordic military system as our generals seem to have
                        against national troops in
                        general. However, despite all objections from both sides, it remains certain that the most
                        thorough improvement of our
                        military establishment, which would place the state’s independence and security on an unshakable
                        foundation, lies in
                        introducing the Norwegian military system to the rest of the king's territories. How painful it

                        crafted in every respect by Frederick III, Christian V, and Frederick IV, is also being
                        corrupted.

                        It would take far too long to go over each of the landowners' concerns in detail here, but they
                        all amount to the claim
                        that their agricultural operations would suffer too greatly from the proposed system.
                        Therefore, it is enough to consider the alternative: whether they would prefer to support the
                        king through a willing
                        exertion of their resources, rather than being forced to serve the enemy. For if the enemy
                        invades, they can be sure he
                        will take as many hands away from the plow as he deems useful and necessary. Often, everything
                        depends on preventing the
                        enemy from penetrating, and if a standing army is not enough and a national army is needed, then
                        they must also accept
                        providing a proportional number of hands for it, whether it is burdensome for them or not.
                        <br><br>
                        To say that Norway can more easily spare its citizens to bear arms than Denmark or Holstein is
                        either saying nothing at
                        all or something deeply unfair. The Norwegian certainly does not find it easier to make a living
                        than the Dane or the
                        German, and even if Nordic farming is not as profitable, it still requires no fewer hands. That
                        even a small decrease in
                        hands is so burdensome for Danish and German agriculture clearly shows that the landowner has
                        more land in his hands
                        than he can manage. Unfortunately, it also shows that these countries are not populated enough,
                        even in comparison with
                        Norway; but is it right to use one flaw to excuse another? And because Denmark and the German
                        lands cannot provide as
                        many hands for the defense of the state as might be desirable due to their modest population,
                        does it follow that they
                        should provide none at all?
                        <br><br>
                        The fairest, most natural, and least complicated approach is to call upon the hands necessary
                        for the defense of the
                        state within its provinces according to the population of each. Such a call arises freely,
                        without coercion, if all
                        farmers in every province are required to remain ready for a certain period of service to the
                        state. In this way, both
                        the sense of duty and willingness to serve will be clear to everyone. For if the distribution is
                        not based on the
                        natural proportion of the population but on the specific conditions of each province, how
                        extremely difficult it is to
                        judge which province could bear more or less. And no matter how good the reasons the government
                        believes it has, the
                        dissatisfaction of those to whom more is imposed is inevitable. Even if a less populated
                        province must leave some land
                        uncultivated to provide its contingent—or, as I would prefer to believe, must cultivate it less
                        thoroughly—this is still
                        far better than leaving it for the enemy to use due to inadequate defense.

                            What the fathers were able to do, those living now and in the future must also be able to do
                            and accomplish. When the
                            author, among other things, states in § 18: "But the Danish and Holstein national
                            soldier"—yes, it is well known, and
                            unnecessary to elaborate on the contrast. He would think, like the Norman, that if the
                            obligation were the same for all
                            farmers, free or unfree, that everyone would have to go to the field and serve a certain
                            number of years if the
                            situation arose during their time. Yes, it is known, and unnecessary to elaborate on the
                            contrast. However, he would
                            very quickly disappear if only some attention were paid to the matter.
                            <br><br>
                            In this regard, I can immediately present to the reader the example of a rural inhabitant of
                            the Duchy of Schleswig, on
                            the border of Jutland, which will receive the approval of every patriot. The example has
                            already been printed, but it is
                            by no means superfluous to print it again here to prove that the farmer does not always
                            think fearfully. In the
                            Schleswig-Holstein Provincial Reports of the year 1790, in the first issue, page 88, it is
                            reported:
                            <br><br>
                            Our farmer no longer thinks like a Norman; he takes pride in it and says warmly: "I was a
                            soldier. I served the king."
                            Those who are familiar with the land committee sessions, especially those who may feel
                            obliged to show a Christian
                            sympathy for this or that head of household under certain circumstances, cannot deny this.
                            There is still more
                            compulsion than pleasure in being a citizen and a soldier for the protection of the land.
                            Nevertheless, it is still said
                            that there is no rule without exception, and this can, in this case, be confirmed by my
                            account, which bears the stamp
                            of truth.
                            <br><br>
                            I recently spoke during my summer walk with a good and sensible farmer who, during the years
                            1758 to 1762, had served
                            with the former Möenschen, now Oldenburg regiment, and participated in the campaign in
                            Mecklenburg. This man had two
                            young, energetic sons. I asked him, somewhat without intention, because a land committee
                            session was to be held, at
                            which recruits and soldiers would be drawn for the land battalions, what he intended to do
                            with his sons. The answer was
                            short and good: "I served my King Friedrich V. with pleasure. I do not regret having seen
                            Mecklenburg on that occasion.
                            My sons may also serve our good and gracious Christian VII. I will not waste a word to free
                            them, nor will I use other
                            means that I know well." The man kept his word faithfully, and no young man took part in the
                            session with indifference
                            about being taken or not, just like these young men, one of whom now rests in his cool
                            grave.
                            <br><br>
                            I asked this man further and confessed to him that I could not quite understand how so few
                            serviceable young men could
                            be drawn in so many large hordes. He answered me enigmatically: "The mixed noble estates,"
                            he said, "cause much
                            misfortune in some hordes." He also expressed his opinion about increasing the rural
                            population, especially where the
                            farmer evidently owns more land than he can cultivate and utilize effectively, which, as it
                            seems, one may not be able
                            or willing to follow, yet should justly follow if one had the common good and the necessary
                            strength of the state in
                            mind. So much for the mindset of a somewhat experienced farmer who has been acquainted with
                            the soldier's status in the
                            Duchy of Schleswig. Whether he may have many fellow brothers who think similarly, I cannot
                            claim. But they think so.
                            Now, what the author states at the end of his thoughts in § 19 will, on the one hand, be
                            resolved by the abolition of
                            serfdom, and the other inequalities, regarding the fact that some provinces still give their
                            contingent in money, could,
                            as I mentioned above, also be resolved without great difficulty.
                            <br><br>
                            In a word, many things could indeed be resolved in the world and under every government if
                            sometimes many things were
                            not considered harder to accomplish than wisdom and deep thought; and therefore, I conclude
                            my trivial thoughts on the
                            author's far better insights and say: all these and other difficulties can be easily
                            resolved if one only wishes to do
                            so.

                        One may boldly lay before an exalted king the state into which the previous ministry has fallen
                        due to the application
                        of false governmental principles, carelessness, and also partly due to private interests.

                        1) It is no secret that the administration is by far not in the condition it should be. The
                        administration of the admiralty
                        has been very lethargic in recent years, and a single member, the finance councilor Fleischer,
                        who otherwise was merely
                        a subordinate of the college, does as he pleases. It is also rumored that a large number of the
                        royal ships, due to a
                        lack of careful repairs, are unable to undertake long voyages.

                            frigates and other ships—totaling 40 sails. Thus, this complaint can no longer be made; it

                        artillery is in even more lamentable circumstances. An engineering corps exists only in name,
                        and the national militia
                        is in such disarray that it will take years to restore it to proper order.

                            <b>Bringing order. </b> The situation with the recruited infantry now appears quite
                            different. If
                            our cavalry were to be
                            increased—as it was in the time of Frederick IV—with several regiments of national dragoons
                            in Denmark and the duchies,
                            and if the hussars were expanded to two complete regiments, it would regain its former glory
                            and undeniable value, as it
                            once held. During the siege of Stralsund in 1711, Danish artillery contributed significantly
                            to the capture of this main
                            fortress of northern Germany. In 1762, it was said of Count St. Germain that, upon
                            inspecting the artillery that was to
                            accompany him on the campaign, he remarked, ‘I have never seen artillery like this.’ This
                            judgment, being very vague and
                            ambiguous, was interpreted in various ways at the time. If one were to judge based on the
                            limited effect the Danish
                            bomb-galleys achieved at Algiers, the verdict on the artillery might not be the most
                            favorable. However, specific causes
                            are cited for this poor result, which do not attribute any fault to the personnel. With the
                            establishment of the
                            national militia—although much improvement has already been made—once serfdom has been
                            entirely eradicated, the desired
                            order could be restored to perfection.

                            <b>Trade no longer exists. </b> I recall reading something fairly plausible once in the
                            Historical
                            Portfolio about smuggling in
                            Denmark. It is argued, not unreasonably, that despite all the guard ships, smuggling still
                            reaches an incredibly vast
                            extent, particularly along the west coast, where no guard ships are stationed, and far more
                            than on the east side, where
                            these ‘Cerberuses’ can be found. I do not wish to dwell on those reports here and will only
                            say briefly that I have
                            never quite understood why Norway and the provinces are treated so neglectfully by the
                            kingdom, their mother. Up until
                            the times of Frederick IV, I believed I found, or at least thought I had found, some reasons
                            why one might treat the
                            provinces in such a way. But why treat Norway similarly, and even Iceland? And why now, when
                            the kingdom no longer has
                            an adverse situation in the provinces? The only explanation I can imagine is that one might
                            feel bound to follow a
                            certain maxim of governance, perhaps necessary in older times without considering present
                            circumstances, even though it
                            is no longer advantageous or truly applicable. But why not recall the saying: Tempora
                            mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis
                            ('Times change, and we change with them')?

                        France for this kingdom has also stifled the possibility of forming a system; since one wanted

                        France, one had to crawl after this power in all respects; and thus it has naturally followed
                        that at present there is
                        not a single power in Europe from which one can justly and deservedly expect any assistance.

                            and harmful. The rule of ‘let it remain as it was’ has its advantages, but truly, if
                            misused, it also has a very
                            detrimental side. Everything I say here is just my opinion; whether I have thereby grasped
                            the matter is another
                            question, one on which I do not intend to engage in dispute.
                            <br><br>
                            What I do know, however, is that customs officers can live quite well, and that during my
                            fleeting youth, when I was
                            occasionally compelled to stay for some weeks in one of our few good trading cities, I was
                            advised to spend my spare
                            time wisely if I ever wanted to enjoy a fine meal now and then. To do this, I should make
                            myself known to the hospitable
                            customs inspectors there, of whom there were four, and make them my friends. Out of
                            curiosity, I gave this a try, and
                            the advisor had not misled me. And those who serve in these posts may indeed be worth all
                            honor, as even the good folks,
                            who are described so in a Danish book—The Honor-Loving Lady—would likely agree. French abbés
                            form a sort of class of
                            people who seem to have a privilege and license to do nothing, amusing themselves in
                            society. Are our court and chamber
                            servants any different? They have quite shrewdly figured it out. But when there are no more
                            customs or stamp-paper
                            positions available, what then? Then they become inspectors and eat well.

                            <b>A political system.</b> Here, I believe, the author of the memoir—whoever he may have
                            been—was
                            too hasty in his thinking.
                            Since 1720, Denmark has had a quite good political system for maintaining peace in its
                            realms and lands. However, under
                            this peace, the military, both naval and land forces, were too neglected, especially under
                            the rule of Christian VI, and
                            were indeed suppressed by the civil state. Other circumstances could shed light on this,
                            though to examine and analyze
                            them here would be too lengthy and serve no purpose. The peace subsidy treaty with France
                            has done more good than harm,
                            and this can be easily proven. And the secret reports from 1761 and 1762 must have been
                            quite incorrect, as certain
                            knowledgeable but crafty politicians publicly claimed at the time that if the Danes had
                            clashed with the Russians in
                            Mecklenburg, a French army would immediately have come to our aid via Oldenburg. Thus, Peter
                            III, whose command of
                            military strategy was by no means seasoned, might have found himself facing a challenge far
                            greater than he had
                            anticipated. Even though the circumstances of the time required that Frederick II yield to
                            this prince, it is well known
                            that it was not at all in his interest to see Peter III's desires against Denmark fulfilled.
                            Fate and providence
                            resolved the matter at once and halted bloodshed in the north in a wondrous way.
                            <br>
                            For this reason, I also cannot agree with the author that Denmark should not expect some
                            form of support from a European
                            power with a rightful claim. Denmark can justifiably hope for and demand assistance and
                            active support from more than
                            one power in times of need. However, it still seems to me to be wiser for a nation to try to
                            maintain its independence,
                            if at all possible, without any foreign help. All of history confirms the truth that nations
                            that have called upon even
                            more powerful neighbors for aid have, for the most part—indeed, almost always—become the
                            prey of those who came to their
                            aid. And was Denmark not in a similar situation under Frederick IV in 1711, when allied with
                            Tsar Peter?

                        6) The internal constitution of the state is completely proportionate to the preceding
                        circumstances. The King's Majesty
                        is poorly served. Private self-interest is the only driving force behind the actions of most
                        royal servants. The citizen
                        and peasant classes are rightly dissatisfied and discontented and can no longer endure the heavy
                        burdens. The best
                        nobility in the countryside has withdrawn from public affairs because they have seen that if
                        they do not belong to
                        certain families, they cannot advance in service. The positions are mostly filled with unworthy
                        subjects. A four-year
                        inflation brought about solely by the greed of the property owners and their influence has
                        plunged all cities into the
                        most evident poverty. The royal revenues have weakened, and the land has become depopulated
                        after a forty-six-year
                        peace, and what is worst is that three to four families have taken control of all the
                        significant offices in the
                        country, distributing all authority so skillfully that it is almost impossible for the royal
                        authority itself to break
                        these chains and set things on a better footing contrary to their intentions and interests. This

                        true representation of the current state of the Danish state. How dangerous and depressing this
                        view is, all the more
                        honor and glory will it bring to Your Majesty if you are not deterred by it, but instead,
                        through your paternal will and
                        a noble steadfastness, strive to abolish the abuses and show your subjects that you wish and
                        deserve to be served with
                        zeal and loyalty.

                            <b>he internal constitution of the state.</b>T If everything said in this section were to be
                            taken
                            literally, then the kingdom
                            was certainly not in a position to inspire a very contented monarch. Indeed, this truth has
                            finally been confirmed more
                            than enough in a printed work of these times. This work explicitly states: — There was
                            nothing more distressing to the
                            King than attending the Council twice and being present there, and I believe (says the
                            author) the reason lay in the
                            fact that His Majesty, from childhood, developed a certain respect and fear for the Council,
                            which over time became
                            habitual. Since such sentiments were not founded on true confidence, and the inner emotions
                            and lasting impressions
                            conflicted, this aversion could easily arise from it. The King occasionally remarked: when I
                            am of a different opinion
                            than the Council, I immediately notice a certain unease on all faces at the required
                            representations, and I must remain
                            silent.
                            <br><br>
                            However, whether the best nobility of the land withdrew from affairs during this period
                            because certain families had
                            arrogated the power to distribute offices solely among themselves—there is much that could
                            still be argued against this,
                            and, for my part, I cannot accept it as an absolute truth, though there is much to say. In
                            general, certain families
                            have already played a significant role in the later years of Frederick IV. Under Christian
                            VI, only the stage and actors
                            changed, and the same happened again under Frederick V, with the only difference being that,
                            in these latter times, the
                            three powerful families were led by a fourth. I heard with my own ears from a son-in-law
                            within that family that, even
                            without any outward splendor, his father-in-law still held the reins completely alone. To
                            what extent this hidden power
                            still operates, and whether it will continue through the descendants just as invisibly as
                            the invisible superiors in an
                            entire order, is a matter on which I have little reason to place my trust. However, it
                            indeed remained a true maxim of
                            aristocratic sentiments in those times.
                            <br><br>
                            This is evidenced by the aforementioned printed work, which explicitly states: It is a
                            custom-established principle that
                            the King of Denmark is to be removed from all affairs, as he would be discouraged from them,
                            overwhelmed by superfluous
                            mechanical tasks in his official duties, not presented with matters clearly and simply, but
                            with essential points buried
                            in lengthy phrases and declamations. He was unnecessarily drawn into details, rarely given
                            the choice between two
                            opinions, but rather made to decide on those already adopted by others, and ultimately his
                            attention was diverted to
                            minor matters, causing the most important issues to make little impression on him.
                            <br><br>
                            The King had so little personal authority that he had no will even in the smallest matters
                            and was controlled even in
                            his private life. As a result, those who attached themselves to him and possessed his
                            tastes, inclinations, and trust
                            were always lost, while others who held opposite sentiments towards him prevailed.
                            <br><br>
                            These times have changed, and, as no patriot would wish, they will not return.

                        dominated only by self-interest and the pursuit of titles, it is very likely that the best

                        administration, but also the most beneficial.
                        Through this alone, Your Royal Majesty can be positioned to maintain an army proportionate to
                        the expansion of your
                        states, to find credit in times of war to assert your rights vigorously, and to resolve in times

                            abuses can be found as examples in all states. In our time, His Holiness the Pope, the

                            the intrigue surrounding the

                        As for the navy, Your Majesty may still try for some time to see whether the minister to whom it
                        has been entrusted will
                        apply more diligence and zeal in the future than has been the case thus far in order to put it
                        into a properly
                        respectable state and maintain it. If this does not happen, Your Royal Majesty will always be
                        able to find capable
                        individuals within the navy to fill this position suitably. It has already been mentioned that,
                        since the constitution
                        is good, it only depends on its execution.
                        <br><br>
                        In the case of the army, this is not the case. Its constitution has not even been properly
                        determined. The Lord's eye
                        and arm can always determine this, give it existence, and make the service honorable and good at
                        the same time. Thus, it
                        is only a matter of proposing what should actually happen. It seems necessary to abolish both
                        royal directories in
                        Norway and Denmark.

                        Note: The savings from the costs incurred will be sufficient to pay the regiments that are
                        currently proposed for
                        reduction by Your Royal Majesty.

                            However, if an honest, insightful, and patriotically minded minister proposes a diligent and
                            honorable relative who is
                            fully qualified for the position and can benefit the state through his dedication, it would
                            be too much to demand that
                            he refrain from doing so merely because he is a minister. At least, that’s how it seems to
                            me, and I could prove from
                            experience that a truly incapable person from such a family has occupied an important office
                            to no good effect. On the
                            other hand, if another individual, whose entire will is constantly devoted to the common
                            good, were denied an office for
                            this reason, it would be an indescribable injustice.
                            <br><br>
                            Thus, I cannot approve the author’s proposal, according to my understanding. The minister
                            must act with integrity; that
                            is unchangeable. But for him to be prevented, solely because he is a minister and an honest
                            man, from recommending a
                            capable relative for any position would be too much—even Hardenberg would not wish for this.

                        to possess all the qualities to be the head of this office; he has grown experienced in

                            There is nothing further to recall about the fleet. In recent times, the outcry against
                            foreigners, without knowing why,
                            has continued among a class of writers, with whom I would not like to associate Professor

                            I could name several still living—more than one man who could have directed and managed the

                            well as this very aged general. However, the proposal came from a foreigner, and moreover
                            from a man who was still in

                        for the regimental
                        commanders. From the incoming reports, the General Adjutants would need to compile the General

                        present them to Your Royal Majesty, allowing you to see at a glance each month the condition of

                            commanding chief can and

                            However, many chiefs,
                            especially in somewhat recent times, seem to find it necessary to engage in many tasks that
                            would not be needed, solely
                            to give the appearance of work, showcasing their diligence, which it is not, by dissecting
                            things and getting involved
                            in all sorts of unnecessary writing. What the author actually intended to convey with the

                            deputies and the directories is not entirely clear to me. In earlier times, various

                            commissariat officials and the regimental and company chiefs, especially regarding forage

                            understand what the author meant by
                            intrigues.

                            <b>Mindset regarding the Military Affairs.</b> Here again speaks the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs.
                            Not every state can be as
                            tense in its military affairs as Prussia. A work of two great rulers cannot, therefore, be
                            imitated everywhere simply
                            because it exists. Denmark and the Prussian states are too different to be governed in the
                            same way. Denmark is both a
                            land and sea power; Prussia is solely a land power. A significant difference.

                        However, there are far too many other, even more important reasons for which this action must
                        take place, and the sooner
                        the better. For as long as these ministers, who are always divided among themselves and only
                        united against royal
                        authority and the military system, are in power, Your Royal Majesty will never be the ruler in
                        your own land. Weakness
                        and confusion will prevail in all departments. If an investigation were to be conducted into the
                        previous measures
                        taken, sufficient reasons would be found to prosecute all these gentlemen. It is better,
                        however, to simply render them
                        incapable of causing harm and, without engaging in an explanation, to remove them in a suitable
                        manner.

                        It seems to pose no difficulty to dismiss Count Moltke and Privy Councillor von Thott from their
                        duties due to their age
                        and weakness. The former is rich enough not to require a pension, and the latter, who, if he has
                        not caused much harm,
                        has certainly never done any good, would view anything Your Royal Majesty grants him in the form
                        of a pension as a
                        favor.

                        The Privy Chamberlain should be favored by His Majesty, if he wishes to, because he had the
                        honor of being Your
                        Majesty's chamberlain, only by dispensing from the Conseil and the Privy Chamberlain's charge,
                        but preserving his court
                        position along with the associated salary of 4,000 thalers, unless he himself applies to retire
                        to his estates, in which
                        case Your Royal Majesty would certainly do well to accept the request.
                        <br><br>
                        As for Privy Councillor von Bernstorf, he has represented the foremost statesman here for so
                        long that, although it is
                        indisputable that his inclination towards all adventurers, no matter from which part of the
                        world they come, is an
                        endeavor to make daily new and mostly harmful enterprises that have cost the state a
                        considerable sum, and that the
                        negotiations at foreign courts under his supervision have almost all regressed, he still
                        deserves to be treated with
                        more management, especially because he has invested his fortune in royal services. Your Royal
                        Majesty could therefore
                        arbitrarily give him the office of mayor of Oldenburg with a good salary to free up hands for
                        him. The current bailiff
                        of Qualen could easily be compensated by another.
                        <br><br>
                        Thus, Your Royal Majesty could transfer him, for example, to the clerical office currently held
                        by Count von Schack, as
                        it is a disgrace that such a subject should govern a province. The Councillor von Wassersleben
                        would have to follow his
                        protector and would likely receive a position in the Oldenburg chancellery. The young Herr von
                        Bernstorf could be well
                        used in Your Royal Majesty's service, just not in the finance department, as he is fundamentally
                        harmful there, and it
                        would be best to send him to a foreign court, as will be proposed later.

                            statements in this proposal.
                            Firstly, which minister in these times has pushed family nepotism to such an extent that it
                            has led to the decay of the
                            state? The apology and the entire Danish world at that time cannot lay this accusation on
                            Mr. von Bernstorf, and neither
                            has posterity done so. He remains dear to the nation, despite the empty clamor of some,
                            perhaps not even well-informed
                            individuals and writers, and his memory is cherished. Secondly, while there is nothing to
                            criticize about the election
                            of Mr. von der Asseburg, and his great merits in the diplomatic sphere are generally
                            acknowledged, the author should
                            have convincingly demonstrated why the removal of Mr. von Bernstorf was deemed so necessary.
                            The fact that he was
                            ultimately dismissed from his duties was brought about by the cabal regarding the Russian
                            alliance, which he
                            courageously supported, as has been printed.

                            ministry, but rather received his dismissal some time later through another cabal due to his
                            commitment to maintaining
                            and strengthening the Russian alliance, and was completely removed from all his duties only
                            when the council was
                            dissolved, I cannot refrain from mentioning here the following information that I heard with
                            my own ears from a general
                            recently gathered to his ancestors. At that very time, the monarch was almost led, due to
                            the insinuations of Count von
                            Danneskiold, to the point where, had he not been fortunate enough to avert it, he might have
                            placed another old minister
                            along with his son in a sort of detention. The general added that the Count still possessed
                            all the heat and
                            stubbornness of his younger years, but age prevented him from accurately considering the
                            matters at hand, causing him to
                            stumble; thus, one only needed to fan the flames that they wished to ignite with this cabal.
                            He would have caused little
                            benefit but much confusion at the direction of the admiralty. This news is true and is
                            evidence that the Count, in
                            submitting the memoir, only sought to confirm and lend a veneer to what it aimed to achieve
                            and was simply ensnared in

                        suggested for this role? There is no one in Your service who possesses even a moderate
                        understanding of financial and
                        commercial matters, and at the same time has the courage to disregard all personal interests in
                        order to organize the
                        finances in a manner that is beneficial to both the King and the public, especially since the
                        previous arrangement has
                        proven detrimental to both. The qualities required for this minister have already been
                        mentioned. Therefore, it would be
                        necessary to seek someone from foreign services who has the capability to establish and maintain
                        everything in
                        accordance with Your Royal Majesty’s most gracious intentions.
                        <br><br>
                        The organization of the royal Prussian finances is to date the best known in the world. The
                        subjects are doing well, and
                        the sovereign is wealthy. Therefore, this model should be adopted, and someone sufficiently
                        informed about it would be
                        better suited for this position than anyone else. All of this will, of course, be subject to
                        Your Royal Majesty's
                        highest and wise insights.

                            <b>To the Chief of Finance.</b> Whether the author possessed such an exact knowledge of the
                            Danish
                            states, as he boldly claims
                            that, upon submitting his memoir, there was no man in the royal services who had even a
                            moderate understanding of
                            financial and cameral matters. (He should have said 'was known to him.') The men who were
                            not unfamiliar with these
                            matters, and as subsequent events have taught us, were actually present at that time, more
                            than one might have believed.
                            However, they were overlooked in the various cabals of the time, the resulting changes, and
                            many fluctuations in the
                            ranks of officials and the actual government system; they were either not utilized or
                            completely removed from their
                            duties. The reader is free to reflect on this more than I wish to elaborate on it. Enough,
                            time has taught and will
                            continue to teach us more. Otherwise, it seems to me—though I would gladly be mistaken—that
                            the author of the memoir
                            either intended to promote himself or perhaps wanted to appoint a Brandenburg friend as the
                            Danish Minister of Finance.
                            As to how useful or harmful this would have been for the kingdom, I leave it to the reader
                            to make the final judgment
                            and—remain silent. </i> </p>
