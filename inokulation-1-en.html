                Upon my dismissal from the botanical institution, which had been dissolved by royal resolution of June
                9th, 1770, it was at the same time indicated to me that His Majesty had most graciously designated me
                for other purposes; and shortly thereafter, as a beginning of this new appointment, I was entrusted with
                the supervision of those experiments in the inoculation of the cattle plague which the Royal College of
                Economy and Commerce intended to undertake.
                <br>
                <br>Just as it is of concern to me — since my involvement in this matter has become publicly known
                through the writing referenced below *) — that this involvement of mine, which emerges only incompletely
                from the said document, should become fully known to the public, so I may also presume that it will not
                be a matter of indifference to the public to see what the person whose experiments are at hand was
                thinking when conducting them; and that both what I still have to offer in elucidation of this
                undertaking, as well as my present thoughts on the matter, will not be unwelcome.
                <br>

                the experiments, to the Royal College of Economy and Commerce as an essential part of my report, now

                    History of the Inoculation in the Year 1770, in General.
                </h3>
                As the pernicious cattle plague still raged violently in several provinces of Denmark, and continued to
                spread more and more despite all applied remedies and measures, the Royal College of Economy and
                Commerce resolved, at the beginning of this year, to conduct trials of inoculating healthy cattle with
                the disease, according to the method of the renowned Mr. Camper in Groningen.
                <br>
                <br>The Dutch physician communicated the details of his procedure to His Majesty’s personal physician,
                Mr. Councillor of State von Berger, in a letter dated May 11, 1770. In order that the reader may
                perceive to what extent the Camperian method was followed in the Danish inoculations, it shall be of no
                disservice to insert the entire account here, translated from the French.

                <h3>
                    General Observations.

                </h3>

                "We have observed that calves do not withstand the disease as well as young cows that have not yet
                calved; and these in turn not as well as cows or oxen of three years of age. The most advantageous time
                for inoculation is in cows one or two weeks after calving. Pregnant cattle are unfit for it, as they
                almost always miscarry prematurely; and the closer they are to calving, the more surely they perish from
                exhaustion or other consequences of such premature miscarriage.
                <br>
                <br>Inoculation must be performed in only a single spot. For this, one uses a few threads of common
                cotton, or spinal cord, or something similar. We allow the hair cord to remain in place; then we draw it
                out. It suffices that it merely passes through the skin. We have, in fact, let it remain for the entire
                course of the illness: this causes no severe consequences, though it does give rise to festering boils
                that are difficult to heal."
                <br>
                <br>"A sign that the infection has taken hold is this: that the skin around the site of inoculation
                swells greatly, and that the pus, which is soon produced, emits a dreadful stench."
                <br>
                <br>The matter we make use of must be taken, in the first days of the disease while it is still fluid,
                from the nostrils of an infected animal.If the matter is collected only when the disease nears its
                crisis, or the animal is already recovering, it is no longer contagious, and the inoculation will not
                succeed. It makes no difference whether the animal from which the matter is taken dies or recovers: we
                have made so many trials that we are convinced that the sole condition is to obtain truly infectious,
                living matter.
                <br>
                <br>“To render the threads infectious, we cut them into as many pieces as needed, each 7 to 8 inches in
                length. These are inserted into the nostrils of a diseased animal and moistened with the fluids found
                there.
                <br>
                <br>We then draw the thread — doubled, tripled, etc. — through a straight needle, 3 to 4 inches long,
                sharply pointed, and keen-edged on both sides of its tip. Next, we lift the skin with the thumb and
                forefinger of the left hand, and with the other hand, we pierce it with the needle. This is done on the
                hindquarter, a little below the ischial bone (os ischium), but not too close to the perineum. We then
                tie the ends together, forming a handle so the cord is not lost should the animal rub itself.
                <br>
                <br>“In summer, we have huts built — of wood, not straw, as the cattle will eat straw, which is very
                harmful. However, the roof may be thatched with straw. These huts are made large enough to house two
                animals. In the field, they are placed on planks near a ditch, so the cattle may be easily watered and
                necessary cleaning performed. Behind the huts, a trench is dug to carry off manure and the like. Huts
                that have been used once may serve for more infected animals, provided they are always washed and
                cleansed. We carried out inoculations in the same huts for a full year.”
                <br>
                <br>For feeding, good grass is used—nothing else.
                <br>
                <br>During the first days after inoculation, the cattle eat and drink as usual.
                <br>
                <br>On the fourth day, it begins to cough, shiver, gnash its teeth, and sometimes refuses to eat or
                drink. We then take 2, 3, or 4 pounds of blood, depending on the animal’s age. The cough is a sign that
                the disease is progressing. The blood clots without separating any serum. If the animal is not infected,
                the blood will yield serum.
                <br>
                <br>On the fifth day, we provide less fodder, but all the more drink; we also add a little barley meal,
                linseed meal, and the like, so that the third stomach is not overloaded.
                <br>
                <br>On the same day, we administer a purgative to the animal. Twelve ounces of sea salt are dissolved in
                a not entirely full bottle of water and mixed with a few spoonfuls of common syrup. This is the best and
                surest purgative one can give to cattle: it causes 4, 5, or 6 evacuations over a period of 8 hours.
                <br>
                <br>On the sixth day, we repeat the salt in a smaller dose and allow much drink, but little food. Then
                it falls ill, yields little or no milk, and so forth; it shivers, coughs, gnashes its teeth, and begins
                to run a fever.
                <br>
                <br>On the seventh and eighth days, we do nothing. If the cattle do not defecate on their own, we again
                give a little salt. If the rectum is loaded with hard dung, it is removed by hand. A clyster of salt and
                water is also effective; alternatively, a smoking pipe of tobacco may be used.
                <br>
                <br>The tenth day is the critical one. With some experience, one can soon tell whether the sick animal
                is improving or not. One offers it a bit of grass with roots, and some soil still clinging to it, or a
                little straw — then it begins to eat again. But care must be taken not to give too much. The drink with
                meal, well boiled, must be continued: it is of the greatest benefit.
                <br>
                <br>“When breathing became very laboured, we performed bloodletting.If the animal would not survive, the
                blood was thin and remained unclotted. On occasion, three bleedings were of service: for pneumonia is
                the worst complication of the disease. Some seemed to recover, but died from suppurating abscesses in
                the lungs and other such effects.
                <br>
                <br>We have used various anti-putrefactive remedies, but without benefit. We now administer none of
                these.
                <br>
                <br>We have inoculated using the hide, the flesh, the fat, the blood, etc., of dead cattle — at times
                taking the matter as late as eight days post mortem. The infection did take hold — but alas! — nearly
                all cows inoculated in such a manner perished.
                <br>
                <br>The milk is not contagious. The nasal discharge, diluted with water and given to cattle to drink,
                had no effect.
                <br>
                <br>I would advise inoculating forty head of cattle at once and building twenty huts. One man can tend
                to them, while another cuts the necessary grass. I leave a space of five feet between each pair of huts
                facing east. While the first twenty huts are in use, another twenty may be constructed; and if fresh
                cattle are inoculated every fourteen days, it is possible to conduct trials with eighty animals in the
                course of a month.
                <br>
                <br>Laukum, May 11th, 1770.
                <br>Petrus Camper.”
                <br><br>

                The supervision of the experiments to be conducted, and their detailed arrangement, was entrusted to the
                then Professor of Botany, Mr. Oeder, acting as royal commissioner; and for the execution of the
                operations and dissections, as well as for the precise recording of observations, Mr. Johannes Wither, a
                surgeon who had travelled at royal expense, was appointed. Professor Oeder was personally present at all
                inoculations during this first year.
                <br>
                <br>The location chosen for these trials was the small island of Aunø, situated on the southern coast of
                Zealand, two miles from the small town of Vordingborg and three and a half from Næstved.
                <br>
                <br>This small parcel of land, the shape and size of which can be seen in the attached plan, is
                inhabited by only a single peasant family. Though it lies half a quarter-mile from the coast of Zealand,
                the sea is at times so shallow that one may cross over on foot without wetting one’s feet. On this side,
                there is sufficient fencing to prevent the intrusion of cattle that occasionally wade across from the
                mainland.
                <br>
                <br>The air is healthy owing to the free passage of winds and the somewhat elevated and level terrain.
                There is also no lack of rainwater pools to serve the cattle for drinking.
                <br>
                <br>Once Mr. Oeder had inspected the location and the entire expanse of the island, and had a survey
                made thereof, it was divided into specific quarters, separated from one another by enclosures and
                ditches.
                <br>
                <br>In the first area (A on the plan), which lay closest to the Zealand shore and also contained the
                farmer’s dwelling, the healthy cattle remained until the time of inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>In the second area (B), stood the cattle that had just been inoculated, until it became ill, as well
                as those undergoing complete recovery.
                <br>
                <br>The third area (C) was for the sick cattle, and here stood the huts. In the section of this quarter
                that lay furthest from the coast of Zealand, the inoculations were performed. The surgeon’s residence
                later came to be located in this area as well.
                <br>
                <br>There were twenty infirmary huts. They were all constructed of boards and designed in such a way
                that a free circulation of fresh air was always ensured. Each hut could accommodate two head of cattle.
                <br>
                <br>The cattle used for the inoculations were always selected with utmost care from those provinces
                where the disease had not yet appeared at all, and were purchased at the King’s expense.
                <br>
                <br>The cattle that were inoculated during the first year consisted of the following groups:
                <br>
                <br>a. Purchased from the inhabitants of the small island were:
                <br>4 cows (as listed in tables No. 1, 2, 3, 4)
                <br>1 “quine” or young cow (No. 21)
                <br>2 oxen (No. 48, 49)
                <br>1 bull (No. 46)1 calf (No. 47)
                <br>
                <br>b. From Bornholm there first arrived:
                <br>16 cows (No. 5 to 20)
                <br>24 quines (No. 22 to 45)
                <br>
                <br>c. From Jutland there were later brought:
                <br>25 cows (No. 51 to 75)
                <br>14 quines (No. 76 to 89)
                <br>
                <br>A total of 89 head of cattle, of which 59 were inoculated in the year 1770. The remainder, as not
                all were to be retained, were sent to the royal estate of Beldringe in Zealand, where they were infected
                with the disease later that same year, and — save for five — were all lost.
                <br>
                <br>Each animal designated for inoculation was entered into a register, with its sex, age, colour, place
                of birth, and number — the latter affixed to a small wooden tag around its neck.
                <br>
                <br>The matter used during the first year was partly taken from diseased cattle that had contracted the
                illness through natural infection and were in a terminal state, and partly from animals that had already
                been inoculated.
                <br>
                <br>The method of collecting the matter resembled that described by Mr. Camper. A cotton cord, about as
                thick as a quill and roughly 8 inches long, was inserted into the nostril of a sick animal and rotated
                in the mucus found therein until thoroughly soaked. If the cord was not used immediately, it was wrapped
                in wax paper or similar, and most carefully preserved in a well-sealed glass vessel. The animal from
                which, and the date on which, the matter was collected were duly recorded.
                <br>
                <br>An attempt was also made to use the moisture dripping from the eyes; however, insufficient quantity
                could be obtained by this method.
                <br>
                <br>During one of the final inoculations in the year 1770, the inoculation cord was first dipped in a
                solution of camphor; however, this was done on that occasion only and not repeated thereafter.
                <br>
                <br>The instrument used to insert the cord closely resembled the type of needle commonly employed for
                surgical hair cords, though it was proportionally larger.
                <br>
                <br>The puncture was made on the inner side of one hip, a hand’s breadth from the perineum; between the
                point of entry and the exit of the needle, a distance of four fingerbreadths was maintained.
                <br>
                <br>The procedure was most effectively performed when the animal was thrown to the ground and held fast.
                <br>
                <br>The cord was left in the wound for forty-eight hours — sometimes even longer — after the ends had
                been tied together.
                <br>
                <br>The inoculated cattle were immediately moved to the second enclosure until signs of the disease
                manifested.
                <br>
                <br>On the third or fourth day after inoculation, they were purged using Camper’s saline solution.
                <br>
                <br>The disease which followed inoculation was entirely similar to the natural infection, but less
                dangerous — at least, significantly milder during the final two years.
                <br>
                <br>In form and nature, progression and variation, duration, etc., it resembled the condition observed
                by Mr. Camper. Any deviations are readily discernible from the case records and annotations appended to
                each inoculation. Among the inoculated cattle on Aunø, pneumonia was likewise not uncommon; bloodletting
                was not neglected in such cases. A tendency toward putrefaction also appeared later in the summer and
                was as prevalent as it was fatal. Rhubarb, Peruvian bark, willow bark, and the like were administered in
                response — but to no avail. Camphor and bark used preventively also proved of little effect. Such severe
                complications were entirely absent in the years 1771 and 1772.
                <br>
                <br>In the case of ordinary diarrhea, a drink made of rye flour was given. Constipation was remedied by
                oily enemas.
                <br>
                <br>No salve or plaster was ever applied to the inoculation site: in recovering cattle, it healed on its
                own.
                <br>
                <br>Each animal that died was dissected, and all internal organs were thoroughly examined. In every
                case, signs of inflammation and gangrene were found in the primary digestive tracts, especially in the
                fourth stomach and the small intestines. The lungs and mucous membrane were frequently inflamed. The
                liver was only occasionally affected. Rarely did the inflammation extend to the kidneys and bladder, and
                in only a single instance was the uterus found affected. The brain was always healthy.
                <br>
                <br>The recovered cattle were left for a time among the sick, and indeed, were at times even covered
                with the warm hide of a deceased animal, in order to observe whether reinfection might occur — but this
                never happened.
                <br>
                <br>Such tested animals remained for a while in the section assigned to the recently inoculated and the
                convalescent. Once they had recovered sufficiently to rejoin the healthy herd, they were carefully
                groomed and washed.
                <br>
                <br>All 11 animals that had successfully survived the disease during the first seven inoculations were,
                on October 8, sent over to Zealand and distributed among the infected herds on the estate of Lystager.
                They were housed with the sick and deceased animals in the same stables and grazed the same fields, and
                were subjected to various additional tests — yet they remained, and continued to remain, healthy.
                <br>
                <br>Camper’s observation concerning the tendency for pregnant cows to miscarry too early was seldom
                confirmed. Most of the cows and quines inoculated in 1770 were indeed pregnant; and those who made it
                through successfully calved — as far as is known — almost all at the proper time. The calves also, for
                the most part, survived.

                <h3>History of the Inoculation in Winter 1772

                </h3>
                <br>
                The successful progress of the inoculation during the preceding summer, and the proven safety of the
                cattle that had undergone the procedure, encouraged various private individuals to protect their own
                livestock against the disease through similar trials. Some did so on their estates, following
                instructions received from Mr. Wither; others sent their cattle to Aunø, where it was inoculated by the
                aforementioned surgeon, with high approval.
                <br>
                <br>Already in November 1771, Madam Councillor von Berger had a cow brought there for this purpose,
                which Mr. Wither at once inoculated with matter from specimen No. 248. This animal did not become
                seriously ill; however, it produced less milk than usual for a few days and refused to eat. It remained
                on Aunø until February, when a new round of inoculations was conducted with additional animals. It is
                recorded in the table under a a.
                <br>
                <br>The remaining eight animals inoculated in February were as follows:
                <br>
                <br>From Captain Thomsen in Rösthovde: one heifer (b b).
                <br>
                <br>From Mr. Schumacher of the same place: one heifer (c c) and one ox (d d).
                <br>
                <br>From the pastor of Schwerborg, Mr. Westengaard: two heifers (e e and f f).
                <br>
                <br>From the parish clerk of the same place: one heifer (g g).
                <br>
                <br>From the forester Horz in Oerslöv: one heifer (h h) and one ox (i i).
                <br>
                <br>Despite the harsh weather and severe cold, this inoculation proceeded quite successfully. The
                animals that recovered, as well as those that never fell ill, remained in full health thereafter.

                <h3>History of the Inoculation in the Summer of 1772

                </h3>
                <br>
                Although the epidemic had already begun to lose its force, and the island of Zealand experienced little
                of it any longer, it still raged fiercely enough in Jutland. By order of the Royal Danish Chamber
                College, inoculations were therefore continued on the island of Aunø.
                <br>
                <br>Four new transports arrived, each consisting of forty healthy cattle from Bornholm, which were used
                for six separate inoculation rounds.
                <br>
                <br>The matter used by Mr. Wither was partly derived from cattle that had been inoculated and
                subsequently fallen ill the previous year, and partly—by direction of the Royal Chamber College—taken
                from infected animals in the Jutland province of Vendsyssel, under the supervision of the Royal
                Provincial Physician, Dr. Lafont. This material is referred to as “I” in the accompanying tables.
                <br>
                <br>The animals which did not fall ill that year were all inoculated a second time, without contracting
                the disease.
                <br>
                <br>The recovered, or otherwise tested, animals were subsequently sold in Wordingborg to the highest
                bidders, and found plenty of takers, as the public was by then convinced of both the benefit and safety
                of the inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>The disease itself differed little or not at all from the form observed in the previous year. Of 160
                animals inoculated, only a single one perished.
                <br>
                <br>The deceased animals exhibited, just as had been observed in the year 1770, a gangrenous
                inflammation in the upper digestive tract, in the mucous membrane, and so forth.
