                <h3>September 2nd, 1770.

                </h3>

                The outcome of the first inoculation is almost too fortunate and may therefore be deemed doubtful.One
                might ask: Can now the ten head out of twelve, since they were affected so little, and some among them
                not at all by the disease, be considered as having undergone the contagion?
                <br>
                <br>To clarify this question, it must at once be recalled that these ten head of cattle have, until this
                day (21st of September), remained in that part of the island set apart as the infirmary quarter, and
                were tended by the very same persons who cared for the sick cattle, wearing the same garments upon their
                bodies — so that, even if the inoculation itself had not infected them, yet the vapours adhering to the
                persons and their clothing might well have done so.
                <br>
                <br>Furthermore, Nos. 5 and 13 were, from the 14th to the 20th of September, at night placed in huts
                alongside the sick and dying, and during the day were tethered (bound to stakes) still near the sick and
                within their exhalation range, without the least suffering therefrom. They grazed with good appetite and
                yielded milk.
                <br>
                <br>This very test was commenced on the 18th with Nos. 8, 14, 21, 29, and 49, and the remaining head of
                the same group shall likewise soon be subjected thereto.
                <br>
                <br>Following this trial, I believe that Nos. 5, 8, 13, 14, 21, 29, and 49 may be exempted from further
                testing, since there have shown themselves on these some signs of infection, such as coughing, eyes and
                nose discharging, reduction in milk, and stiff blood upon lying down — which, according to Mr. Camper,
                is to be held as a sign of infection having taken place.
                <br>
                <br>No. 14 was not bled until the 9th, as it had been placed on trial and was heard to cough, which
                aroused suspicion. The blood was then found to be in statu naturali et sano (in its natural and healthy
                state).The remaining three head, Nos. 25, 33, and 38, in which not the slightest sign of infection has
                manifested, are to be inoculated a second time after some interval.But why, one may further ask, have
                these head come off so lightly?
                <br>
                <br>No. 2, which died, was inoculated with matter from No. 3, and with the very same matter Nos. 29 and
                49 were also inoculated, both of whom live still; likewise, later, No. 23, which died, and No. 26, which
                still lives, though it had been severely afflicted.In like manner, No. 47, which died, and Nos. 5 and
                21, which yet live, were inoculated with matter from No. 1.The animal from which Matter No. 1 was taken,
                died; that from which Matter No. 3 was taken, recovered. Both kinds of matter have brought forth the
                disease both unto death and unto recovery.
                <br>
                <br>The matter for the first inoculation was five days old; in the second inoculation, quite fresh
                matter was used for six head, and twelve-day-old matter for two. Nonetheless, No. 23, one of the latter
                two, was the first to perish among all those of this second inoculation.Thus, the cause of the fortunate
                fate of the ten head preserved from the first inoculation lies neither in the age of the inoculation
                matter, nor in the fate of the creatures from whom said matter was derived; or, more correctly, if aught
                lies in these circumstances, then our experience—so far as it now extends—has not yet revealed wherein
                that aught may consist.
                <br>
                <br>The cause of the happy outcome is not to be sought in the care or in any special treatment of these
                beasts. We let them go by day and night upon the grass and merely kept a watchful eye upon them, to
                observe if aught should manifest, and bled those that coughed.Since only Nos. 2 and 47 became ill, they
                received the purgative remedy 2c. But with the other ten, nothing further was undertaken.
                <br>
                <br>Shall we say that the cause must lie in a particularly sound constitution of these ten head?That may
                well be, and can readily be believed; for without doubt, the danger impending upon every beast to be
                subjected to this disease through inoculation is greater or lesser according to whether its constitution
                be sound, its humours healthy, and its partes nobiles uninjured, or not.But since these twelve head were
                selected entirely at random, and without the slightest intentional choice, from a herd of 49, and
                likewise the 8 head of the second and the 2 of the third inoculation were drawn by chance from a number
                of 37 head, it would surely be a rather singular coincidence that we should have chanced the first time
                upon robust, and the second time upon feeble cattle.
                <br>
                <br>It is not unreasonable, and indeed common practice, to reason about the cattle plague by analogy and
                comparison with the smallpox in man.Now experience shows that many persons pass through the pox so
                lightly that the disease becomes almost imperceptible, and its presence can only be discerned ex effectu
                from the pustules themselves, however few they may be;likewise, that cattle may have had the cattle
                plague in only a very mild degree and yet be secured against it in future,just as persons who have had
                the smallpox but lightly are nonetheless deemed protected against further attack,and we may say that to
                complete the analogy, only one thing is lacking: namely, that as in man, the outbreak of pustules is a
                proof that the disease, though otherwise imperceptible, had been present in the body, so also in a beast
                which shows only slight symptoms, one would wish for just such a clear token of the real presence of the
                cattle plague.
                <br>
                <br>Now, since in the case of the cattle plague there is lacking such a criterium ex exanthemate, and
                yet, as said, it is possible...
                <br>
                <br>And it is credible that a lesser and a greater degree of illness are, in respect to future
                expectation, the same;
                <br>
                <br>thus arises the question: at what degree may one rest content? And this question further divides
                into the following:
                <br>
                <br>Is it not sufficient, if a head of cattle, after inoculation, coughs, has weeping eyes and a runny
                nose, and lessens its intake of fodder, even though it does not yet cease to ruminate nor lose its milk,
                and so forth?
                <br>
                <br>Must these symptoms of necessity all appear together, or can one alone suffice, so long as such an
                inoculated and but lightly afflicted beast is afterwards able to endure being among sick and dying
                cattle, or within infected and uncleansed stalls?
                <br>
                <br>Ought one, with Mr. Camper, to insist upon a higher degree of disease—that it cease to eat, cease to
                ruminate, have strong excrement, etc.?
                <br>
                <br>Ought one then, if a beast appears not to have been ill enough, to of necessity perform the
                inoculation a second time?
                <br>
                <br>Is it not possible—indeed worrisome—that one might overdo the trial, and expose the animal to
                greater danger than is necessary? Might it not be, that through repeated infection, one overtaxes a poor
                creature, which perhaps might otherwise have withstood the contagion by the usual, natural course?
                <br>
                <br>One will tell me that in humans who have already had the pox, the inoculation proves ineffective;
                but may not our conclusions from the analogy go too far?
                <br>
                <br>I would but further remind, that No. 2 ought justly and fairly to be removed from the reckoning, and
                this case considered insignificant, seeing that this cow was without doubt already ill prior to
                inoculation; and now I shall proceed to the second inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>There too may No. 7 be omitted ex computo, for it is not to be believed that the gallbladder of that
                beast only fell into the condition in which it was found after death, during the course of the illness.

                <br>
                <br>And generally speaking, we must and shall readily reconcile ourselves to seeing such animals die
                without astonishment, which, at the very time they are appointed to undergo inoculation with so perilous
                a disease, may already bear other afflictions within their bodies.Were it possible, as with man, to
                detect such afflictions beforehand also in beasts, one would not choose such subjects for
                inoculation;but since we cannot avoid, in the case of cattle, the risk of at times selecting those which
                are already weakly predisposed, it is only just that — in comparing the number of deaths following
                inoculation with those who remain alive — this considerable circumstance be taken into account,a
                circumstance which, caeteris paribus, even if the methodus medendi of inoculating cattle were brought to
                perfection as it is (or nearly is) in the case of smallpox in humans — which is still far from the case
                — must still render the inoculation of beasts necessarily more precarious than that of men.
                <br>
                <br>I assert that the methodus medendi is far removed, not even near any notable degree of perfection,
                and this is abundantly evident from the accounts of the second and third inoculations. Of ten head, only
                three have survived, and even now, at the moment I write this (on the morning of the 21st of September),
                two of these three convalescents are not yet out of danger.
                <br>
                <br>I see clearly that the overfilling of the omasum (the third stomach) is one of the gravest
                complications; and if a beast, having just taken in abundant nourishment, is then violently struck by
                the infection, and suddenly loses the power to ruminate, I deem it lost —as difficult would it be to
                remedy a clogged omasum as to dissolve a stone. The inflammation then gains fierce ground, as the
                groaning of the beast attests, and if death does not occur in the first stage — stadio inflammationis —
                it follows soon after from dysenteric discharges of the bowels, when nothing passes from the omasum to
                the abomasum but thin, putrid fluids filled with the corruption of burnt fodder mash.I do not even
                believe that bloodletting is particularly effective against such a blockage of the omasum; it may temper
                the inflammation somewhat and thus delay death a little, but it will hardly avert the ensuing dysentery.
                <br>
                <br>As for peripneumonia, which is likewise a very serious — and according to Mr. Camper, the gravest —
                symptom of this disease, there is still some hope that it may be prevented or alleviated by
                bloodletting; but the obstruction of the omasus mostly perplexes me.On account of it, it becomes
                necessary to restrain the animals from eating at their own discretion. To leave it to chance that they
                shall cease eating on their own when their appetite fades is too great a risk — for then they might
                cease only when it is already too late, and the fodder found in our slaughtered beasts was surely still
                from the first days after inoculation.Yet one must not starve them either, nor torment and weaken them,
                when a dangerous illness approaches which requires the full strength of nature.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, when the fourth inoculation was performed on four head of cattle, I ordered that they be
                housed at night in huts, and during the day tethered upon mown-down fields where there was little to
                graze — and that they be modestly fed by hand with fresh grass, frequently, and each time in small
                amounts.Furthermore, shortly after the inoculation, and even before the bleeding, I had them given a
                gentle laxative, to make good use of time — for once the illness breaks out in earnest, it makes swift
                work.
                <br>
                <br>I ordered the bloodletting to be performed as soon as one heard a beast coughing, and the eyes
                reddened and began to water — even if the nose had not yet begun to run, for waiting for that as well is
                to wait too long.I commanded it to be repeated if the breathing became labored, or if one even heard the
                beast groaning — which is a very dire sign, and a sure expression of the pain caused by the advancing
                inflammation.
                <br>
                <br>The blood, in these beasts as in humans, in statu naturali after bloodletting, shows its two
                principal parts — crassamentum and serum — clearly separated and unmixed.In statu morbido, it deviates
                from this natural state in two opposite ways:It either becomes stiff, where the serum is absorbed into
                the crassament and does not separate; or it becomes loose, and the crassament dissolves and mingles with
                the serum like a thinned pulp.The former is a sign of inflammation; the latter, presumably, a sign of
                impending putrefaction — and of very ill omen.
                <br>
                <br>I note in the inflamed blood of this beast the absence of the so-called coenum inflammatorium or
                fatty film, which is commonly observed in humans, and conclude that it must be peculiar to those who
                consume meat. This observation serves as a justification of the old rule, that those in whom this fatty
                film is habitual — such as rheumatics, arthritics, and podagric individuals — ought to moderate their
                intake of animal food, or, if they are able, abstain from it altogether.
                <br>
                <br>I had the Osterhuysian draught administered in trial to two specimens, No. 30 and 35; and as the
                blood of No. 22 and 34 was found, upon bloodletting, to be dissolved, I also gave these the Osterhuysian
                draught together with a decoction of willow bark — yet all the animals, alas, perished.I tasted the
                draught myself, to ensure it was not too acrid; but the question remains whether grass-eating animals
                tolerate acids — especially mineral acids — as well as humans do.
                <br>
                <br>In recent days, we have begun employing borax with honey, both as a nasal injection and as an oral
                remedy. The noses of the creatures so treated have since become cleaner. I was prompted to this trial by
                reports that borax has lately been found highly beneficial in the treatment of aphthae (thrush) in
                humans, and because the condition of the human intestines afflicted with aphthae appears to me somewhat
                analogous to the state of the ruminant stomachs in this illness, when the villous coat is detached.
                <br>
                <br>I shall for now conclude these observations by presenting the general concept I have formed of this
                disease:I hold that its seat lies in the mucous membrane (membrana mucosa), which lines all internal
                parts of the body that are exposed to contact with the external air — and that the disease consists in a
                corruption of this mucus.The dominion of the illness thus extends as far as this mucosa extends — and
                that is far indeed: over the eyes, nose, mouth, and throat; the windpipe and all its branches (aspera
                arteria and bronchiae); the entire alimentary canal (canalis alimentarius) from the gullet to the rectum
                (oesophagus usque ad anum); and finally also to the bladder with its afferent and efferent ducts
                (ureters et urethra).This mucosa falls into inflammation; the inflammation causes watering of the eyes
                and nose, peripneumonia in the lungs, lack of gastric juice in the stomachs, intense irritation in the
                intestines — and when it reaches its peak, gangrene in all these parts, in some more than others.From
                the inflammation there follows a rapid transition to putrefaction of the blood, as in all malignant
                cases.The disease is therefore an inflammatory and malignant catarrhal fever (febris catarrhalis
                inflammatoria et maligna).
                <br>
                <br>In my view, the bile plays but a minor role in the matter, and if it becomes corrupted — which,
                amidst the general disorder of the canalis alimentarius, is no wonder — such corruption is a consequence
                of the disease, not its cause. It is in vain to hope for much from medicines that are supposed to act
                directly upon the bile; and in general, medicines are feeble weapons against so formidable a foe. If
                they are to do any good, they must be administered in liquid form, and dissolved in a plentiful volume
                of fluid. We must bear in mind the enormous volume of the stomachs of these ruminant animals, and that
                these stomachs are never empty — they cannot be emptied. Concentrated remedies are, as it were, cast
                into an abyss, vanishing into the mass of fodder-pulp without effect — or, if they do happen to act upon
                some spot in the gut, they act far too violently and drastically.
                <br>
                <br>Above all, it must be considered that the disease is of a highly inflammatory nature, and that it
                demands bloodletting — liberal and repeated bloodletting, without any delay.
                <br>
                <br>The advantages of inoculation must therefore, in the conception one forms of it, consist in the fact
                that one is made aware of the enemy’s approach, in order to meet him accordingly.

                <h2>
                    Continuation, October 11

                </h2>
                The confident tone with which Mr. Oesterhuys speaks of the benefit of acidum salis, the attention his
                report has received in Berlin and Hanover, and the analogy-based supposition of the usefulness of
                acidorum in a morbus putredinosus, have led me to attempt the Oesterhuysian draught on several
                creatures. But the outcome was not as hoped. It appears that these grass-eating animals do not tolerate
                acida, especially mineralia, as the carnivorous human does — and this seems to be one of the many points
                at which analogy fails.
                <br>
                <br>Since the eight head of cattle used in the second inoculation seemed to lack sufficient evacuation,
                and upon opening, all stomachs — especially the omasum — were found completely impacted, it seemed to
                follow that the animals must from the very beginning be kept on moderate feeding and with open bowels.
                But all four animals, upon which this regimen was observed, have died; and although No. 3, in the days
                from September 26 to 29, was in such a condition that one began to count it among the convalescents, it
                nevertheless relapsed and perished.
                <br>
                <br>In these four cases, the disease began to reveal its altered course, showing from that time on an
                increasing tendency toward dysentery. This very same course was likewise taken by the disease as it
                approached the village of Kiöng, and soon thereafter spread both within that village and the surrounding
                ones, manifesting itself by diarrhoea from the first signs observed in any given animal.
                <br>
                <br>From the case histories it is apparent that the disordered composition of the blood — when it
                appears, namely, dissolved (i.e. when the crassamentum is dissolved into the serum, forming with it a
                thin pulp) — and the diarrhoea are mostly contemporaneous symptoms, and that both — one as much as the
                other — indicate a state approaching putrefaction.
                <br>
                <br>It is also evident from the case histories how swift the transition from the stadio inflammatorio to
                putredo has been.
                <br>
                <br>Furthermore, these accounts show that all those who had dissolved blood have perished, with the
                exception of No. 4.
                <br>
                <br>Hence it follows, in my opinion, that when diarrhoea is observed, one must presume that the blood is
                dissolved, and accordingly, bloodletting must not be undertaken.
                <br>
                <br>If bloodletting is to be done, it must occur in the stadio inflammatorio; and since this phase is
                very brief, bloodletting must indeed be performed early.
                <br>
                <br>The disease is of an inflammatory nature and thus appears to require bloodletting without fail; and
                I, for my part, will not omit it — until fuller and more mature insight into the disease teaches me
                otherwise. Yet I do hold it possible that, upon further experience, bloodletting — as in all malignis —
                may prove a remedium anceps (a remedy as dangerous as it is curative). All these malignae have the trait
                of causing the blood at first to coagulate, and shortly thereafter to dissolve.
                <br>
                <br>They do not tolerate many evacuantia (purging agents), and the nature, being afflicted in its very
                core, rather calls for roborantia (fortifying remedies).
                <br>
                <br>Without presuming in the least to decide beforehand what experience may further teach us regarding
                the progress and course of the epidemic in other seasons of the year, I believe I may assert this much:
                that, if — as in this autumn — it manifests itself through diarrhoea, it may well be necessary to turn
                one's attention toward roborantia. Mr. Camper, who says nothing at all about what he does with those
                animals that are severely affected by the disease introduced through inoculation — whether he allows
                nature to take its own course or not — does not seem to have had a dysenteric epidemic before him, since
                he regards peripneumonia as the worst of all afflictions.
                <br>
                <br>There is no doubt that the disease is modified by the seasons, and it is only natural that in autumn
                it manifests as dysentery, when the cold and rough weather suppresses exhalation, and the vapors that
                should be expelled thereby are instead diverted to the intestines.
                <br>
                <br>The epidemic has recently also increased in malignancy by now attacking the kidneys, which had
                previously been found uninjured in dissected animals. Those tending the cattle have noted that the urine
                has taken on an unusually foul odor. This assault on the kidneys too should rightly be considered a
                consequence of suppressed perspiration.
                <br>
                <br>As I have been instructed to continue inoculation during this autumn — a task I approach with
                reluctance — I selected 12 head of Jutland cattle and had them inoculated with cords soaked in a
                solution of camphor: half in camphor dissolved in olive oil, and the other half in camphor dissolved in
                white French brandy. At the same time, I had two more animals inoculated with cords infected in the
                usual manner, without camphor. All fourteen had the same quantity of blood drawn and were housed in huts
                where they should remain both day and night. I also prescribed that three of the animals inoculated with
                solutio camphorae spirituosa, three with solutio camphorae oleosa, and the two with cords untreated with
                camphor, should receive each evening a bolus composed of half an ounce of cortex peruvianus mixed with
                diluted honey, to which one scruple of camphor dissolved in brandy had been added. For the remaining six
                animals, nothing beyond the bloodletting is to be done until the disease manifests itself.
                <br>
                <br>The speculation in this experiment is to observe whether the virulence of the inoculation matter
                may, to a certain degree, be mitigated by admixture with camphor.
                <br>
                <br>Whether the early use of cinchona bark might prevent the putrefaction of the blood, and whether
                camphor could preserve a state of perspiration through which the mass of blood might gradually rid
                itself of the poison introduced into it through inoculation?
                <br>
                <br>This speculation rests on the following grounds and observations: namely, that camphor is thought to
                break the virulence of the smallpox matter; that animals which develop pustules and eruptions in this
                disease usually survive; and that likely the animals which emerged so mildly from our first inoculation
                rid themselves of the administered poison through perspiration — aided by the then very fine, warm, yet
                not overly hot, and calm weather.
                <br>
                <br>These considerations still sustain in me some hope that inoculation might prove beneficial, if
                undertaken in spring or summer — provided the heat is not excessive.
                <br>
                <br>Should the present speculation fail, however, I genuinely hesitate to continue with inoculation at
                this time, as I see the matter as little better than sending the cattle straight to the slaughterhouse.
                The entire undertaking to attempt inoculation rests on the hope that the disease thereby induced will
                prove less malignant. If it does not — but attacks the animals just as severely as the naturally
                occurring epidemic — then the inoculated cattle are in no better condition than those attacked by
                chance. To attempt saving animals that are severely afflicted — whether by art or by accident — is a
                futile endeavor. What we must strive for is to bring it about that they are only mildly afflicted; and
                if we find one season unsuitable, we must wait for another which may prove more favorable.
                <br>
                <br>Given the little good fortune we can claim, and the great misfortune under which our neighbors all
                around Aunø are groaning, it is a great satisfaction to me that we — thank God — have managed to keep
                our own healthy cattle in good health, although they have been grazing freely in the open on Aunø the
                whole time, while we were inoculating and had sick cattle on this small piece of land. Our unfortunate
                neighbors cannot accuse us of having contributed to the outbreak or spread of the disease in this area,
                for then, without question, our own healthy cattle would have had to be infected first of all. Rather,
                our neighbors can see that it is possible, through proper caution, to ward off the contagion, and that
                one need not fear airborne spread when due measures are observed.
                <br>
                <br>There are, unfortunately, all too many more immediate means by which this plague can spread, and
                among the many other faults in the structure of our agricultural system must also be counted this
                important one: that under the current conditions of said system, it is nearly impossible to prevent the
                spread of the cattle plague. It was present in Næstved and the surrounding area when we began our
                undertaking on Aunø. It appeared at the beginning of September in Vester Egesborg, about half a mile
                from Kjøng, and since the stubble fields were opened to general free grazing after the harvest, it has
                now spread everywhere here — in the parish village of Kjøng, in Sallerup, in Kostræde, and now finally
                to Svinø, across from our land Aunø, among these our neighbors. These neighbors themselves admit that
                the disease came to them from their neighbors in Kostræde, and in general, no reasonable person lays
                blame at our feet; on the contrary, all reasonable farmers exonerate us.
                <br>
                <br>It is to be feared that the disease may yet reach Vordingborg before winter.

                    Continuation, October 26

                </h3>
                I had already begun to hope for a favorable outcome of the experiment involving the immersion of
                inoculation cords in camphor. My hopes were chiefly strengthened by the fact that the six head of cattle
                whose cords had been treated with an oily camphor solution were all affected by the disease earlier than
                the other six, whose cords were treated with solutio camphorae spirituosa. It seemed to me that this
                difference could not simply be ascribed to chance. So I thought: it appears that the mixing of camphor
                with the inoculation matter is not without effect — but the camphor must be dissolved in brandy, not in
                oil; if the matter mixed with camphor in brandy infects less swiftly than that mixed with oil, then
                perhaps it also infects less severely, and thus is likely to induce a milder form of the disease — and
                if this explanation holds true, then we have achieved what we aim for with inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>I still flattered myself with this hope yesterday, but today it sadly vanishes, as the remaining
                four head of cattle begin to groan — a fatal symptom indicating a growing inflammation of the
                intestines. The outcome with these four animals, which will become clear tomorrow or the next day, will
                now decide the validity or invalidity of the speculation underlying the 8th and 9th inoculations.
                <br>
                <br>I do not intend to conduct any further experiments this year, and must once again declare that I
                cannot bring myself to sacrifice the remaining 25 healthy head of cattle in a season so clearly
                unfavorable for our undertaking.
                <br>
                <br>No clearer proof of the influence of the weather can be had than in the 6th and 7th inoculations
                carried out on September 25 and 26. From the 5th we retained two of six animals; but from the 6th we
                retained not a single one out of eight, and from the 7th only one out of seven. Yet on the 27th, 28th,
                and 29th of September, there was extraordinarily harsh weather — precisely the days following these
                inoculations — during which the poison introduced through them likely began to manifest.

            <section id="chap3">

                <h3>
                    Continuation, November 9

                </h3>
                In order to cease inoculations for this year, I have – beyond the other reasons – also this one: that,
                as I must believe, the infection once introduced into the huts (which cannot be dispelled so easily)
                adds itself to the infection introduced through the inoculation into the body.Mr. Camper states that he
                inoculated all summer long in the same huts, only with some cleaning done. We followed his practice and
                cleaned the huts as thoroughly as possible – but no matter what one does, the infectious tinder may
                still linger in the thatched roofs made of straw and reeds.
                <br>
                <br>Therefore, I find it necessary, if inoculations are to be resumed next spring here on Aunø, that a
                portion of the huts – half of them, or even just eight – be dismantled and reassembled at Purmose, and
                designated for housing the just-inoculated cattle. This applies to the period from the time of
                inoculation until the disease reveals itself through recognizable symptoms, after which the animals may
                be transferred to the proper sick-huts.In this way, one can be assured that the disease, when it
                manifests, is solely the result of inoculation, and not of any other concurrent infection. And once the
                disease has visibly broken out in one animal, it seems to matter little whether the hut it is moved to
                is already contaminated – and in any case, it must be indifferent to us, since it is impossible to build
                new huts for each inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>Meanwhile, it is certainly best if one can dispense with huts entirely and has no need to bring the
                inoculated cattle into them. This advantage can be hoped for in the pleasant spring and summer season,
                and I consider it most advisable to leave the patients day and night out on the grass in open air, as
                long as the weather is at all tolerable, and to regard the huts merely as a refuge in case of bad
                weather or excessively strong sunshine.
                <br>
                <br>I cannot help but believe that the fortunate outcome of our first trial was due to this advantage
                and the favorable weather at the time.
                <br>
                <br>We began our undertaking somewhat late in the year, so that, based on this year's experience, no
                decisive judgment can be made either for or against the matter – and accordingly, the endeavor must be
                continued next year from the end of May through the middle or end of September. At least this year has
                yielded the gain that, in the coming May, one can immediately set to work without first losing time to
                preparations.Furthermore, aside from the 25 cows already present from this year's herd and not yet used,
                only young cattle aged one or two years should be procured, as they cost less and are more suitable for
                the intended purpose.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, I must repeat the reminder already given earlier: the benefit of inoculation must be sought
                and understood to lie in the fact that the disease thereby introduced ought to manifest in a milder
                form.If it presents itself just as severely as with ordinary, accidental infection, then there is just
                as little to be done for the dangerously ill inoculated cattle as for any other afflicted by the
                plague.It follows that the wisest course is simply to inoculate and then let nature take its course,
                without attempting too much in the way of medication.
                <br>
                <br>The conclusion of this matter follows in the next section.
