1)
Preface.

For some time, I have been considering reprinting the present considerations and additions, as the first edition is out of print, 
and no time could be more appropriate for this than the present. The truths presented in it have become the subject of a solemn and notable commission in Denmark, 
which has been set up to investigate the constitution and improve the peasantry.

The consideration was written with regard, though not explicitly stated, but at least visibly so to my contemporaries, 
for Denmark, of which I was then a resident and subject. It was written at the instigation and with the approval of two significant men, 
my patrons, with the intention of contributing to the general attention awakened to this subject by the King's declared gracious intentions 
for the peasantry, and amidst the conflicting opinions about it.

2)
to clarify the matter and bring it to light. Shortly before the publication of the additions, 
I had ceased to be a member of the then-existing Land Commission, a position I held for only a short time, 
but precisely during the period when a decree for the regulation of corvée labor, announced by two preceding ordinances, 
was finalized by the said Commission, for which I gladly acknowledge my part.

Both writings, in their time and place, caused noticeable and well-known sensations, and I believe, 
with the agreement of my friends who were familiar with the circumstances of the 
time — both of the former and the subsequent periods — that, without boasting, 
I can consider myself an early and passionate advocate of the truths now being discussed, 
who has significantly contributed to their dissemination and paved the way for the current investigations. 

Thus, as an old resident of Denmark, which I regarded as my second homeland for a large part of my life, 
as a servant of this state in this field, and as the author of these writings,

I believe it is fitting for me, upon the renewed publication of these writings, 
to also present a more detailed discussion accompanied by proposals regarding the matter currently under investigation: 
the relationship between landlords and peasants in Denmark. I aim to present this discussion according to my own views and in my own manner, 
and I believe it is not only fitting but also incumbent upon me to demonstrate the feasibility of my proposals. 
Such a discussion would serve to clarify the truth and be welcomed by those who are lovers of the truth.


I have often thought about a continuation of the additions, which are to be regarded as notes. 
There would be enough material for such notes from page 25 to the end of the "Considerations," and I would 
particularly like to comment on what is said on pages 17, 18, and 70 regarding paper money and circulation. 
However, a changed situation, being placed in the service of another master, official duties, and other affairs, 
especially with advancing age, diminish the drive for such a continuation and increase the obstacles.

The kind reader here receives the "Considerations" and the "Additions," 
both as they appeared when they came from the press, the former in 1769 and the latter in 1771.
Furthermore, as supplements:

I. Some considerations on the constitution of the national militia in Denmark.
II. Reasons for the decree issued in Denmark in 1771 by the then General Land Commission to determine corvée services.
III. An example of a regulation made in accordance with my principles for an estate in the Duchy of Schleswig.
IV. Representation of the Royal Danish General Land Commission to the King, dated 17th August 1771.
V. A closer discussion of the prevailing relationship in Denmark between the landlord and the peasants residing on his estate, along with proposals.
