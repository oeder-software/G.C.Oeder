At the Oldenburg Widow and Orphan Fund, to which there hath now also been added a Life-Annuity Fund, the Süßmilchian Mortality-, or, as I rather choose to call it, Decrement-Table hath been laid down unchanged as the foundation, even as it standeth in Süßmilch’s book, and likewise in the Oldenburg Reports which Mr. Kritter had before his eyes; so that I cannot comprehend how Mr. Kritter can say that I assumed mortality to be greater than Süßmilch.
Without doubt mortality is different with the different sexes throughout the whole of life and its stages, and this difference showeth itself very early, since more boys are born than girls, yet their surplus is already lost in childhood, and in the end, at all enumerations, there is always found a surplus of the female sex over the male.
<br>
<br>Properly we ought to have two Decrement-Tables, one for the male, one for the female sex; and thus in all cases the valor existentiae solitariae must be calculated according to the Decrement-Table of the sex of the pensioner, the valor coëxistentiae, when the provider and the pensioner are of different sexes, according to both tables; for every case where the price of a dependent pension is to be determined, the reckoning would be four-fold, namely, whether both provider and pensioner be of the male sex, or both of the female sex, or the provider male and the pensioner female, or the provider female and the pensioner male. Mr. Kritter, in assuming a special Decrement-Table for the women, hath not done enough; he must also have a special Decrement-Table for the men: and the Süßmilchian Decrement-Table, which is abstracted from the totality of mankind, both sexes taken together, would become wholly superfluous.
Such two different Decrement-Tables, one for each sex, would indeed be to be wished for; but we have them not as yet, and I am of opinion that they cannot be derived from a few partial observations on a couple of parishes, upon some hundreds of individuals, but must be abstracted from experiences on a multitude of individuals, in their thousands and tens of thousands, upon whole provinces, even as the present Süßmilchian Decrement-Table hath been abstracted for both sexes taken together, before they can be accounted canonical.
<br>
<br>But I must direct Mr. Kritter to something more important than the difference of the sexes, and to which he seemeth to have given but little thought, and indeed in the whole matter of widow-funds little hath yet been considered, namely, to the contemplation of the difference between mankind in general, as they exist amongst and beside one another, and the married couples who enter into widow-funds; between men in general, the strong and the weak taken together, and those men who, as providers of their wives, are admitted to such institutions; between women in general, and those women for whom eventual pensions are sought.
Manifestly these men and women are selected persons, the women assuredly healthy, for what man would readily enter a widow-fund on behalf of a sickly wife? The men vi testimoniorum; and though, alas, there may be examples of fraudulently obtained health-certificates, yet we must, out of Christian charity, believe that those who attest will not easily act against oath and conscience.
This consideration is confirmed by the experience of the Calenberg widow-fund: I have in hand the report of the first 1270 couples, who were enrolled already in the year 1767, and it is certain that fewer marriages have since that time been dissolved than might have been expected; that is, the members of a widow-fund are more enduring folk than married couples in general.
It therefore remaineth reserved for our descendants to balance fully the foundation of widow-funds, when they shall one day be able to abstract decrement-tables for men and for women, consisting solely of persons who have truly been members of such institutions. And even as it is already now, with regard to the Calenberg society, a pity that the men who, upon the death of their wives, e nexu depart, do, so far as I know, vanish from view, and their day of death, and thus the length of their life, remaineth unknown; so would it be altogether lamentable if this society, numbering over 5000 couples, such as will scarcely ever again be brought together, should be dissolved and scattered, and the accounts of the life and death of its members not be preserved unto posterity.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile we take from this consideration a counsel to tolerance, whose recommendation, according to the history of the controversies concerning this matter of widow-funds, hath become as necessary as in any subject of human knowledge and opinion, and as one would scarcely have expected in a subject of mathematics. Furthermore, we would, so long as it remaineth advisable in human institutions, make or maintain provisionally good and proper establishments, even though the greatest desirable perfection thereof cannot immediately be obtained, rather than wholly lack them; we may safely adhere to the Süßmilchian Decrement-Table for the present, for truly the danger in its use, of which Mr. Kritter causeth us alarm, if we do not exactly adopt his table, is not so very great; we must only attentively and diligently compare the course of mortality among the interested parties of our institutions with the hypothetical ages according to the Süßmilchian table, and not give our establishments excessive extent; so shall we always discover in due time any threatening deviations of actual experience from our assumptions, and always retain the remedy within our power. We must justly consider that if we proceed too cautiously, e.g., by assuming the durability of the women to be too great, we may also render the admission to widow-funds too difficult for the people.
I mentioned above the matter of tolerance. It pleaseth Mr. Kritter to reject our Oldenburg widow-fund and my calculations, because they deviate almost five percent from the truth, and thereby compel me, contrary to controversy, which also hath no time for it, to answer somewhat thereto. According to my treatment of the Delmenhorst example, the expenditure, income on capital, and income on contributions foot were as 100: 97.99: 106.39; according to Mr. Kritter they stand as 100: 101 1/6: 101 3/4.
<br>
<br>Shall this be the proof of Mr. Kritter’s assertion? Then I must tell him that from these proportions alone nothing can be inferred, but that the coincidence or lack thereof between the actual age experienced at the time of enrolment and the hypothetical age, which according to the standard of the Decrement-Table laid down as a basis was to be expected, must be taken into consideration; and how this comparison will fall according to Mr. Kritter’s Decrement-Table, I know not. According to the Süßmilchian Decrement-Table and according to the table in §XVI of my essays in the Oldenburg Reports, the actual age of the men lasted 1.826 years longer than the hypothetical age, and for the women 3.43 years longer, and thus the results of my calculation of income and expenditure are precisely as they ought to be. Since the actual age of the women (as is already noted in §XI of my essay) exceeded the hypothetical age slightly more than that of the men, it becomes understandable why the income on capital foot falls 2 percent too low; but since in both cases, men and women, the actual age exceeded the hypothetical, and consequently the marriages lasted longer than presumed, it is also understandable why the income on contributions foot came higher than the expenditure. Under such circumstances, it could and it should not, if the calculation is to be correct, produce an exact balance between income and expenditure.
Mr. Kritter and I are agreed on the modum calculi, and differ only with regard to the assumed Decrement-Table: Mr. Kritter proposes a correction of the Süßmilchian table concerning the female sex, and I say it is yet too early; partial experience with few persons will not suffice, and I would, for example, after the experience of the 154 Delmenhorst couples, not willingly reform the Süßmilchian table. Therefore, once again: tolerance! And if I may still add something, it would be, after all that has been written about widow-funds, and according to Mr. Florencourt’s book, the reminder: fat prata bibere.
<br>
<br>Oeder.
