          An Account
          <br>of
          <br>a Work,
          <br>which by Royal Command is to be published,
          <br>entituled FLORA DANICA,
          <br>together with a Specimen Plate of the Cloudberry Plant
          <br>(Rubus Chamæmorus.)
        </h1>
        A considerable Part of the Royal Botanical Institution, which hath been but lately established here, consisteth
        in the Publication of a Work, treating of all such Plants as grow wild by Nature, and without the Aid of Man,
        within His Majesty’s two Realms and other Territories in Europe. The full Title of the Writing shall be framed
        according to the said Realms and Territories; yet here and elsewhere we shall refer to it solely by the
        abbreviated Title of Flora Danica.
        <br><br>
        His Majesty’s principal Aim with this Work is of a Paternal Nature, tending toward the Diffusion of Knowledge
        concerning native Plants throughout His Realms.
        This Diffusion of Herbal Learning among the Inhabitants of the Land is to be pursued, inasmuch as Botany cannot
        be of general Benefit, so long as it remaineth a Science confined to a small Number of Botanists.
        If that Benefit is to be attained, which the Publick with Right and Reason may promise itself from a Knowledge
        of the Kingdoms of Nature—whence Mankind doth reap its greatest Advantages, yet which, if we are to speak
        candidly, is far from being attained in its full Extent, but rather remaineth still to be hoped for, and must
        not be limited within too narrow Bounds, as for Example to Medicine alone—then all doth chiefly depend upon the
        Union of Plant-Knowledge with the Opportunity of making Experience thereof.
        <br><br>
        Such Opportunities commonly fall to the Lot of those who deal with Plants, when these are to be applied to the
        Use of Mankind in the several Occupations of civil Life; yet especially to those whose Lot it is to dwell in the
        Country, as it were in the Bosom of Nature, and who give their Attention to the Affairs of Husbandry.Amongst
        this numerous Class of useful Citizens in the State, there are not indeed many who are, in the strictest Sense,
        what one calleth Learned by Profession; but on the other hand a great Multitude who, if we except the Learned
        and Foreign Tongues (and often there is not even Need to except the latter), do nevertheless possess all that
        appertaineth to a true Lover of the Sciences: Understanding, Education, Means, Leisure, Inclination—and,
        moreover, a peculiar Affection for Botany above other Sciences, which their domestic and private Circumstances
        naturally foster.Therefore this Science, for the Benefit of such Lovers—and thereto, methinks, nought more is
        required than Will—must, so far as possible without Prejudice to its Soundness, be rendered easy; and in this
        regard, I believe likewise, that the Botanist might verily make the Matter much more accessible to the Curious,
        if they did but will it.Lastly, the Instruments placed in the Hands of such Enquirers must be sufficient unto
        the Purpose, so that they be not of Necessity obliged to resort unto foreign Writings in order to make Use of
        them.
        <br><br>
        According to this Manner of Thinking, the Arrangement and Composition of our Flora is undertaken and carried
        forward; and His Majesty, being firmly resolved to carry His Paternal Intention into effect, shall cause a
        considerable Number of Copies to be distributed, as a Royal Gift, among the Clergy of His Realms and
        Territories.These Copies, being allotted to each Diocese, shall be lent, for a certain Period of Time, by the
        Bishop or Superintendent thereof, to those among the Clergy who best know how to apply the Work to Advantage,
        and who may in turn serve the Botanical Institution and Garden by their Correspondence.
        <br><br>
        Besides this principal Aim, it is likewise the Will of the King—who is a great Patron and Promoter of all
        Sciences—that even Foreigners may reap Benefit from the Work; which may assuredly come to pass, since it
        containeth Plants from a vast Extent of Land, reaching from the further Side of the River Elbe unto the Frozen
        Ocean, and in Latitude from the 53rd to the 70th Degree, including Mountain and Shore Flora, besides many other
        Varieties of Soil; and thus may prove useful in the greater, and especially the northern, Part of Europe.
        Flora Danica shall therefore likewise be composed in the Latin Tongue, and the Inhabitants of these Lands shall
        have the Choice between the Latin and their native Language.
        <br><br>
        Before I proceed to give a detailed Account of the Arrangement of this Work, I must first set forth a few
        Reflections concerning the Nature of an Undertaking of this Kind, especially touching the Collection of the
        Copperplates, which form the most costly Part of the Work.
        <br><br>
        An Undertaking of this Kind is no Work for a Private Person; its Continuation requireth greater Expense, greater
        Zeal and Support, and above all more Time, than may reasonably be expected from the Strength of a single
        Individual, or than may consist with the Frailty of human Life and the Uncertainties of Fortune.The History of
        Botany affordeth us more than one Example of the Perishableness of such Projects.Flora Danica is therefore no
        private Enterprise; its Publication is incorporated, as a principal Part, into the Constitution of the Royal
        Botanical Establishment, and its Preparation, further Enlargement and Improvement is committed to every
        Professor of the Royal Botanic Garden as an Official Duty.Thus, the Purchasers of this Work have no Cause to
        apprehend that it should at any Time come to a Standstill and augment the Number of those many other like
        Writings that have remained in their Imperfection; for I can, without Boasting, assure that this Flora shall
        become a Work without Equal—unless some other Government should engage in an Undertaking of like Nature.
        <br><br>
        It is indeed true that, by Words and Descriptions alone, Plants may be rendered sufficiently recognizable, and
        that Drawings thereof are not in every Case absolutely necessary; yet it is likewise true, that even with the
        best of Drawings, the oral or written Instruction of the Botanist, and the Aid of his Science, are still
        required, in order to make profitable Use of such Figures.
        Nor is it my Opinion that, because a Botanist is able, by referring to a Figure of a Plant, to teach others to
        know the same, he is thereby absolved from the equal Obligation to describe and define it in Words, with the
        same Exactness, as if no Drawing of it existed.
        Upon such a Declaration, even the most rigorous Botanist will not, I trust, censure me for extolling the Value
        and Use of Drawings; his own Experience will inform him how much lighter his Labour, especially in comparing
        botanical Authors, hath proved in regard to such Plants as he hath found well-drawn.
        And the Approbation of those who are not Botanists by Profession I likewise confidently anticipate.
        It is undeniable, that one may much more easily and rapidly learn to know Plants when, in addition to literal
        Knowledge, one hath Recourse to Engravings, than when it must be accomplished by Words alone.
        And had more – yet good and serviceable – Drawings been furnished since the Invention of the Art of printing
        Letters and Plates, instead of incomplete Descriptions, Botanists would, for the most part, have been spared the
        toilsome Labour expended upon Synonymy, less Occasion would have been given for Complaint concerning the
        Multiplicity of Names, the initial Knowledge and Recognition of Vegetables would have been more widely diffused,
        and a greater Advance would have been made in the Knowledge of the Uses of Plants.
        <br><br>
        All objections raised against the use of engravings and the multiplication of botanical works adorned with
        copperplates amount chiefly to this: that such works are deemed expensive.To this it may ever be replied, first
        of all, with the question: which is of greater cost — the time and labour that such a work saves to the lover of
        botany, or the sum of money he expends on this instrument of aid?This question each may answer according to his
        own condition, yet equity demands that every man be offered as many aids as he may be able to
        appropriate.Secondly, it is not, in truth, the natural price of good copper engravings in themselves that
        renders such works burdensome, even to the botanical amateur of moderate means, but rather the circumstance that
        he cannot obtain any uniform and, in its kind, complete collection, but is compelled, should he merely wish for
        figures of the plants that grow within a single mile's circuit about his dwelling, to purchase a whole
        assemblage of books, wherein he finds drawings of unequal quality and merit, repeated endlessly the same and
        again the same, while that which he chiefly seeks and would make use of lies scattered among a far greater
        quantity of superfluous matter.
        <br><br>
        This circumstance is that which weighs upon the lover of botany as well as upon the science itself; and the wish
        that such a burden might be alleviated is indeed a good one, yet in vain so long as rulers do not extend to this
        useful science their helpful and puissant support.
        Should a potentate in the southern parts of Europe cause a work to be undertaken akin to Flora Danica, regarding
        the plants of his own realm, then would his country first and foremost reap the nearest benefit thereof, to wit,
        the same utility which we in these northern kingdoms promise ourselves from Flora Danica; thereafter, all
        botanists in all lands and regions would possess two works which together contain the far greater portion of the
        flora of all Europe, upon which they might found their labours, and from time to time append such peculiar
        specimens as may be found within their circle; and such gaps in those works might then be the more swiftly
        filled with the aid of a third or fourth potentate in the East, the West, or the heart of Europe.
        Thus would a complete collection of engravings of the entire European plant world arise—without disorder,
        without repetition; and thereby a common foundation would be laid for the whole science, which would be rendered
        infinitely more accessible and its diffusion much advanced.
        <br><br>
        I now betake myself to the arrangement of the Flora Danica.It is His Majesty’s will that both the native plants
        in themselves be rendered recognizable, and likewise that their utility be made known to the inhabitants of
        these realms and lands.The whole work is accordingly divided into two principal parts: the one which treateth of
        botany in itself (Botanica pura), and the other which concerneth the application of botany to human usefulness
        (Botanica applicata).In the present communication I speak solely of the Botanica pura.The composition of that
        part which regardeth the usefulness of plants is entrusted to a society, of which I am a member, and in which I
        shall also wield the pen; and concerning that part a separate account shall in due time be published.
        <br><br>
        The text shall be separated from the drawings. Many diverse causes concur and render such an arrangement
        necessary.
        <br>The collection of copperplates was to be distributed in fascicles, and under such circumstances, regard
        could not be had to order, concordance, or system; whereas, in a book designed to serve as instruction in a
        science where order is the very soul, a systematic coherence must be maintained.
        <br>A convenient format was therefore to be chosen for the introduction to botany and the catalogue of the
        plants, which are the two parts of the text, in such wise that one might carry the book into the field and
        therewith seek out the plants in nature.
        <br>Lastly, consideration had to be given to the convenience of the various sorts of amateurs, since not all
        would be disposed to procure every part of the work, though one would gladly serve them all.
        <br><br>
        The collection of these copperplates the purchasers shall be pleased to regard as a so-called Herbarium vivum,
        which one gathereth and augmenteth as occasion permitteth, arrangeth in due order after some time, when a
        sufficient number is assembled, and preserveth the whole herbarium as an auxiliary, to be employed upon sundry
        occasions, and thence to be kept, as one seeth fit, alongside the writings of the botanists, to the illumination
        thereof.
        <br><br>
        The plates shall be marked with the rubric Flora Danica, and each given a number in sequence, such that the
        first fasciculus containeth sixty plates, and the second commenceth with Tab. 61. The size of the plates
        correspondeth in some degree to the size of the plants, yet all shall be printed upon paper of equal dimensions,
        as may be seen by the specimen. Upon each plate there shall appear but one plant, save for the small plants
        belonging to the Dilleniæan class of mosses, which shall be reserved till the end, in order that the drawings
        thereof may be gathered, and thereafter several of like kind may be brought together upon one and the same
        plate. The larger plants shall be represented in a somewhat diminished scale, while their notable parts shall be
        depicted alongside in full size; for the smaller plants, the magnifying glass shall be employed, not only to
        show what the unaided eye cannot discern, but likewise to afford the painter opportunity to express with his
        brush, with greater clarity, what a good natural eye might still distinguish. Throughout the whole work, all
        parts wherein lieth the distinguishing mark of a species from others shall be separately represented, when the
        same cannot be made apparent in the full depiction of the plant itself. All the drawings are made after Nature,
        and from fresh specimens, and I trust that connoisseurs shall be pleased with the labour of the artists
        appointed by the Royal Botanical Establishment, to wit, Father and Son, MICHAEL and MARTIN RÖSLER, the former
        engraver, the latter painter. With each fasciculus shall be included a printed sheet, upon which the names of
        the plants contained therein shall be set forth.
        <br><br>
        These fascicles begin to be published prior to the text, their publication likewise continuing whilst the text
        is brought forth, and shall persist, even after the whole of the text hath in due time been revealed, until such
        time as all the plants appertaining to the Flora shall have been delineated. Every proprietor of this collection
        is thereby given full liberty, either to have the fascicles bound immediately as they appear, or, should he so
        prefer, to keep them unbound until his collection hath progressed so far as to allow the parts to be arranged in
        a systematic order.
        <br><br>
        This collection shall therefore comprise delineations of both the common and the rare plants; our principal
        intent, namely to be of service to the inhabitants of these realms and lands, did require such a plan. All
        plants in general do merit attention, and if the work is to serve them aright, it must be in itself sufficient,
        and other writings ought not to be deemed absolutely necessary. Upon the aforecited grounds, I likewise trust
        that, in regard to the science itself, foreigners and professional botanists will be pleased to receive an
        uniform collection of drawings, even of the most common plants.
        <br><br>
        The parts of the text are as followeth:
        <br>1. An Introduction to Botany, together with a separate Treatise concerning the Method of Instruction.
        <br>2. A Catalogue of the Plants found in the Royal Dominions, in which, according to the rules of
        distinguishing
        marks, are set down for each species so many, and no more, of its properties as are strictly necessary to render
        it discernible from others; this catalogue being chiefly designed for practical use.
        <br>3. A Collection of full and circumstantial distinguishing marks or descriptions of these plants.
        <br><br>
        These three parts of the text do indeed constitute a whole, yet they shall be composed in such a manner, that
        each of them shall be a book by itself, which in its particular intent may be deemed complete, so that the one
        shall not necessarily require the other. These parts of the text shall be sold both collectively and separately,
        as well with the fascicles as without them, in order that every lover of the subject may, according to his
        means, be served; and that no one be debarred from obtaining what his circumstances may allow him to procure.
        <br><br>
        The first part of the text shall be delivered to the domestic lovers of the subject by the end of the year 1762;
        the foreign ones shall receive it together with the second fascicle.
        <br><br>
        The description and the delineations shall be completed as soon as I have either entirely or chiefly concluded
        my travels through Denmark and His Majesty’s German provinces; and as the journey through Norway is already
        accomplished, the remaining necessary travels for the sake of Flora will not consume much time.
        <br><br>
        No pre-subscription is required, but only subscription, with the purpose of determining the number of copies
        thereafter. Particularly those desiring illuminated copper plates must apply in good time, as no further
        illuminated copies will be made than those which are ordered. Subscribers, who sign up, will receive a
        certificate thereof, and the subscription price for an unilluminated copy of the first fascicle is 4 Danish
        courant rixdollars, and 9 rixdollars for an illuminated copy; however, those who do not subscribe will have to
        pay a fourth more later, and after the subscription period, no illuminated copies will be available. Payment is
        to be made in cash upon receipt of the copies, and the subscription can be made here in Copenhagen with me and
        the booksellers Mrs. PHILIBERT and ACKERMAN; elsewhere, the interested parties are kindly requested to contact
        the person through whom this notice is communicated to them.
