                    Accounts of the Commerce of the Town and Diocese of Drontheim in Norway.
                </h2>

                <section id="chap2">

                    <br>During the time I resided in the town and diocese of Drontheim, from the autumn of 1758 until
                    into January 1760, the late Roger — who was then gathering materials for his Lettres sur le
                    Dannemarc — requested information from me concerning the industry of this diocese, which he also
                    received.
                    <br>
                    <br>Since neither Mr. Roger nor his successor Mr. Reverdil reached as far as the provinces in their
                    letters, and as I presume that accounts of the not insignificant industry and commerce of one of the
                    northernmost parts of Europe will not be unwelcome to lovers of political economy, I shall, from the
                    materials preserved at that time (for I have kept no copy of the memorandum sent to Mr. Roger),
                    provide a brief account of this industry in the diocese of Drontheim.
                    <br>
                    <br>The diocese of Drontheim (in the native tongue Trundhiem or Tronhiem) consists of four counties:
                    Drontheim,
                    Romsdal and Nordmør (to which the bailiwick of Sundmør is also attached under this governor’s
                    jurisdiction, though it otherwise belongs to the diocese of Bergen),
                    the Northern Lands,
                    Finmark;and it comprises three towns: Drontheim, Christiansund in Nordmør, and Molde in Romsdal.

                    <br>
                    <br>In the census conducted in the Danish states in the year 1769, the entire diocese was found to
                    contain 164,722 people:in the county of Drontheim: 70,520,in the county of Romsdal and Nordmør:
                    25,382,in the Northern Lands: 53,500,in Finmark: 5,984,in the town of Drontheim: 7,478,in the town
                    of Christiansund: 1,151,in the town of Molde: 707.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the town of Drontheim, including its two suburbs, there were in the year 1758 a total of
                    1,318 hearths and 125 warehouses situated along the water.
                    <br>
                    <br>With Finmark, a closed trade is conducted from Copenhagen, while the Northern Lands trade
                    primarily with Bergen, and their connection with Drontheim is of little significance, so that these
                    two districts are excluded from the consideration of actual Drontheim trade.
                    <br>
                    <br>As for the overland commerce which this diocese carries on with Sweden and with the diocese of
                    Christiania — regarding which something more shall be said later — definite accounts are lacking,
                    and thus these reports are chiefly limited to the maritime trade, which is conducted and transacted
                    in the three customs towns: Drontheim, Christiansund, and Molde.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>The customs duties in these three towns — both on outgoing and incoming goods — were at that
                    time leased to a company (to my knowledge, consisting solely of merchants from Drontheim), and it
                    was the beginning of a new ten-year lease, which had been preceded by a previous ten-year lease.
                    <br>
                    <br>Through the courtesy of this leasing company, I received extracts from the customs registers for
                    the year 1758; a respected merchant, a member of this company, undertook the task of reviewing these
                    extracts with me, so that we appraised each item of the outgoing and incoming goods, and I shall now
                    present to the readers the results of this operation, along with a detailed account of the principal
                    articles.
                    <br>
                    <br>The appraised value of the goods registered at customs in Drontheim was:
                    <br>Exports in value – 268,320 Rthlr
                    <br>Imports –––––––––– 263,500
                    <br>Surplus of exports – 4,820
                    <br>
                    <br>The appraised value of the goods registered at customs in Christiansund:
                    <br>Exports –––––––––– 74,000
                    <br>Imports –––––––––– 28,000
                    <br>Surplus of exports – 44,000
                    <br>
                    <br>The appraised value of the goods registered at customs in Molde:
                    <br>Exports –––––––––– 34,900
                    <br>Imports –––––––––– 16,000
                    <br>Surplus of exports – 18,000
                    <br>
                    <br>The volume of this trade, in terms of exports and imports, thus amounted to 681,820 Rixdollars
                    (Rthlr.), and the surplus of exports over imports was 67,000 Rixdollars.
                    <br>
                    <br>Among the exports from Drontheim there went:
                    <br>for 9,200 Rixdollars to Denmark,
                    <br>2,820 to the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein,
                    <br>5,600 to other parts of Norway,
                    <br>100,700 to foreign places outside of Danish dominion,
                    <br>150,000 of refined copper (Garkupfer), mostly all to Holland.
                    <br>
                    <br>Among the imports that came to Drontheim:
                    <br>for 52,000 Rixdollars from Denmark,
                    <br>17,600 from the duchies,
                    <br>10,600 from other parts of Norway,
                    <br>193,000 from foreign places outside Danish dominion.
                    <br>
                    <br>And if one compares the last two items of the exports with the last item of the imports, the
                    foreigner has had a balance of 57,700 Rixdollars to pay for goods he took from Drontheim — not
                    counting what was taken from Christiansund and Molde.
                    <br>
                    <br>Among the goods imported into Drontheim were:
                    <br>for 39,250 Rixdollars grain
                    <br>12,900 – malt
                    <br>540 – hops
                    <br>16,680 – flax and hemp
                    <br>11,900 – tobacco in leaves
                    <br>14,000 – manufactured tobacco
                    <br>26,400 – sugar
                    <br>5,700 – wine
                    <br>6,570 – brandy
                    <br>6,660 – tea and coffee
                    <br>5,550 – salt, namely 3,550 French, 2,000 Portuguese
                    <br>1,660 – saltpeter
                    <br>8,500 – iron
                    <br>562 – coal
                    <br>11,870 – silk goods
                    <br>47,650 – woollen goods
                    <br>1,034 – hats
                    <br>18,420 – linen goods
                    <br>500 – lace
                    <br>14,350 – goods from the so-called hardware shops, among which 863 Rixdollars for paper
                    <br>1,930 – playing cards
                    <br>8,170 – goods from the so-called spice shops
                    <br>1,010 – soap
                    <br>3,823 – gunpowder
                    <br>4,000 – leather
                    <br>950 – bricks and roof tiles
                    <br>840 – worked silver
                    <br>
                    <br> Among the goods exported from Drontheim were:for 66,500 Rixdollars fish, including 26,800
                    Rixdollars worth of herring26,400 – boards, of which 24,000 Rixdollars were red spruce (Pinus
                    Abies)4,100 – furs and hides, including 2,200 Rixdollars in goatskins15,400 – train oil1,410 –
                    tar2,120 – millstones
                    Of the ships by which this trade was carried on, 26 were based in Drontheim, carrying a total of
                    1759 lasts, among which 5 were of 200 lasts or more, and no sloops are included. From Denmark and
                    the duchies, 18 ships arrived in Drontheim, together 600 lasts; from other Norwegian ports, 9
                    vessels, among them 3 sloops, together 405 lasts; from England (its western coast), Scotland and
                    Ireland, 15 vessels, together 1200 lasts; from Holland, 5 vessels of 228 lasts. That makes a total
                    of 83 ships and 4192 lasts. Christiansund had 2 and Molde 4 ships of its own. Altogether, 73 ships
                    unloaded or loaded in Drontheim, 37 in Christiansund, 22 in Molde — in all three customs towns, 132
                    ships, of which 58 were from foreign ports.
                    <br>
                    <br>The year 1758 was a poor year, as can be seen from the following comparison.

                    <br>The fishery along the Drontheim coast was poor in this year, and the fish—which, next to copper,
                    form the most important export article—usually fill many shiploads. In particular, a kind of lean
                    but large herring, which finds great demand in the Baltic Sea, is accustomed to appear in winter
                    months after New Year along this coast, especially near Christiansund (where, incidentally, for
                    readers in Germany, the ocean remains always open, and ice can only form deep within the narrow,
                    winding inlets—fiords, or firths in English). These herring shoals, which in the previous decade had
                    yielded extremely well for the then leaseholding company—since in 1753 alone, 70,000 barrels of
                    herring were exported from Christiansund, and in 1754, 74,000 barrels, of which two-thirds of the
                    value were net profit for the country—had already declined in the last two years, and failed so
                    completely this year that scarcely a few individual fish of that kind were to be seen.
                    <br>
                    <br>It was a poor year, and yet Drontheim, together with its two kindred small towns, had a surplus
                    in its maritime trade balance of 67,000 Rixdollars. The diocese likewise gains considerably from the
                    trade it carries on by land with Sweden and with the Diocese of Christiania or Aggershuus, although
                    the amounts of this traffic cannot be specified.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is immediately striking, when considering the above-mentioned import articles, that 26,000
                    Rixdollars' worth of tobacco and an equal amount of sugar represent quantities far exceeding the
                    consumption of the diocese itself. However, the city of Drontheim possesses a considerable
                    tobacco-manufactory and a sugar refinery, for which the raw sugar was imported from Copenhagen—this
                    was included among the 52,000 Rixdollars’ worth of goods from Denmark—and it distributes both of
                    these goods, as well as much coffee and tea, wine and brandy, and many haberdashery goods, inland.
                    With all these goods, the Swedes, including the Lapps in the adjacent provinces of Jämtland and
                    other parts of Swedish Norrland, can supply themselves better, more conveniently, and more cheaply
                    from this part of Norway than from their own trading towns. No measures by any government, however
                    jealous it may be, can prevent this, and the goods which the Swedes can offer in exchange by no
                    means compensate for what they take from the Drontheimers. This trade with the Swedes takes place
                    especially at a market held in Levanger, six miles northeast of Drontheim, and held occasionally
                    throughout the year.
                    <br>
                    <br>The traffic with the inhabitants of the Diocese of Christiania is particularly occasioned by the
                    copper mine at Røraas, sixteen miles southeast of Drontheim. Since the inhabitants of this mining
                    town and district, situated on a barren, wild expanse, must be supplied with every conceivable
                    necessity, this gives rise to a supply trade that is not confined merely to the actual needs of the
                    residents of this mining district but also extends to an exchange of goods among the suppliers
                    themselves. For on the one hand, those who come with freight to Røraas also wish to have freight
                    back again, and on the other, their charterers can count on the fact that if they send more goods
                    than are strictly needed for Røraas, there will also be several purchasers there besides the
                    inhabitants of Røraas, and that they can in turn receive from there goods they require. What is not
                    directly exchanged remains for indirect barter in the warehouses of trading inhabitants of Røraas,
                    and this exchange of goods is sometimes, in winter—the proper season for all land transport in
                    Norway—as lively as a fair. Those who come to Røraas to fetch copper back to Drontheim therefore
                    bring all manner of necessities, especially fish products from Drontheim, not only for Røraas but
                    also for the inhabitants of the valleys in the Diocese of Christiania who come there. The
                    inhabitants of the Drontheim parish of Selboe, whose actual trade is freight transport between
                    Drontheim and Røraas and who have many hundreds of horses in use, particularly carry many millstones
                    that they quarry in their parish to Røraas. These millstones are then fetched from there to the
                    valleys of the Diocese of Christiania and distributed throughout the diocese, just as it happens by
                    sea from Drontheim to the Diocese of Bergen and further southwards; for in Norway every farmstead
                    has its own mill, so the trade in millstones is quite significant. The inhabitants of the valleys of
                    the Diocese of Christiania particularly bring iron to Røraas, as there are no ironworks in the
                    Diocese of Drontheim except for one ironworks not far from Drontheim, which was newly established at
                    the time but did not succeed well. The Swedes also come much to Røraas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>I believe it is rather an understatement than an exaggeration to assume that the surplus of the
                    inland trade that Drontheim conducts, together with the above-mentioned 67,000 rigsdaler profit from
                    maritime trade, makes up a total sum of 100,000 rigsdaler. With this amount, this Diocese must and
                    can also cover its usual taxes and duties to the King, after deducting what the government itself
                    spends within the district, as well as its remittances to Copenhagen to compensate for the expenses
                    of students and others from Drontheim residing there, and for what Drontheim spends at the national
                    colleges to manage its affairs. It is understandable that prosperous years, such as the years from
                    1749 to 1755, when the fisheries were so fortunate, yield a surplus that can form the foundation of
                    a wealth from which one can also draw in poorer years or in times of extraordinary circumstances.
                    <br>
                    <br>The thoughtful reader will easily perceive that there is still material here for many kinds of
                    reflections; however, I shall conclude this brief report with the remark that Drontheim conducts a
                    most thorough and important trade, as thorough as scarcely any other part of the royal Danish
                    states, and more important than most of my German readers would likely have imagined.
