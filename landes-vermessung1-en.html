                    First Section.

                </h3>
                This survey is, as is proper, founded upon trigonometric observations combined with astronomical ones.
                <br>
                <br>The method employed in this context is similar to that described by Mr. Justice Councillor and
                Professor Bugge in Copenhagen, in his work published in the Danish language in the year 1779, of which a
                German translation appeared last year under the following title:
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Thomas Bugge, Royal Danish Justice Councillor, Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy at the
                University of Copenhagen and of the Royal Navy; member of the Academies of Sciences in Stockholm,
                Copenhagen, Mannheim, and Drontheim: Description of the Surveying Method employed in the Danish
                Geographical Maps. With copper engravings. Dresden 1787.
                <br>
                <br>The editor of this translation is Mr. Friedrich Ludwig Aster, Electoral Saxon Engineer Major; the
                translator is Mr. Johan Friedrich Marcus.
                <br>
                <br>The procedure described by Mr. Bugge corresponds to that outlined by Mr. Cassini de Thury in his
                Description Géographique de la France, Paris 1783.
                <br>
                <br>The procedure adopted as a model in Denmark gave me occasion to enter into correspondence with the
                aforementioned Mr. Justice Councillor Bugge, and further occasion for the Royal Land Surveyor Mr. Caspar
                Wessel to be assigned to us for a time, upon the request of His Serene Highness the late Bishop and Duke
                Friedrich August to His Majesty the King of Denmark. Mr. Wessel was already most favorably known to us
                from the early maps of Denmark prepared by him, which were published under the supervision of the Royal
                Society of Sciences, and who, during the years 1782 to 1785, proved himself here to be an excellent man
                through his masterly and exemplary execution of his duties.
                <br>
                <br>By means of the astronomical observations conducted in the temporary observatory erected for his
                service upon the local rampart, Mr. Wessel determined the latitude (pole height) of the observatory,
                drew and defined its meridian line by means of two points on the ground located approximately a quarter
                of a mile apart, determined the inclination of the sides of the triangle system closest to the
                observatory in relation to this meridian, and established the longitude of the observatory by observing
                the lunar eclipse of the 10th to 11th September 1783. Since the winter nights in our Oldenburg, situated
                too near the sea, are seldom clear enough — and even when they appear otherwise bright, a fog bank of 30
                degrees or more often lies along the horizon — few of the observations which Mr. Wessel laboriously
                attempted to carry out, such as the occultations of fixed stars by the moon, could be successfully
                completed.
                <br>
                <br>The meridian line, drawn immovably on the ground, now serves us — by means of a beautifully and
                precisely constructed horizontal sundial — as a regulator for our city clocks, should we choose to make
                use of it.
                <br>
                <br>Since the late Duke Friedrich August, in addition to commissioning a map of the land, had also
                ordered the preparation of a special chart of the Weser river, with both banks included, and as we, in
                order to properly capture the width of the river’s mouth, had already extended the triangulation from
                Bremen along the Weser — with permission from the Royal and Electoral Government in Stade, and in such a
                way that the points were taken alternately from one bank to the other — down to the land of Wursten
                below Bremerlehe: it was further decided that this triangulation should be continued down to the
                headland near Ritzebüttel, and from there up the Elbe to Freyburg and Hammelwörden, opposite Glückstadt.
                <br>
                <br>At the same time, upon requisition by our Duke, the Royal Danish authorities ordered and carried out
                the continuation of the triangulation that had been drawn from Copenhagen through the islands to Jutland
                and thence southward — which had, at that time, reached as far as Husum — to extend it further to the
                Elbe near Glückstadt. For this, Mr. Skanke, a colleague of Mr. Wessel, was employed. As proof of the
                reliability of the operations of these two gentlemen, the exact agreement of their determinations of the
                distances between the places where they met — one coming from the south, the other from the north, each
                proceeding through a long chain of triangles, each guided solely by the sequence of their calculations —
                can serve. I shall only repeat the example given at the bottom of page 166 in the German translation of
                Mr. Bugge’s treatise, namely, the distance between Marne and St. Margareten, which according to Mr.
                Skanke measures 55,732.4 feet, and according to Mr. Wessel 55,771 feet, so that the excess of the latter
                measurement amounts to not quite 1/1000 of the former.
                <br>
                <br>This connection of our triangulation system with the Danish one now enables us to have before us a
                chain of triangles extending from Copenhagen, across the islands of Zealand and Funen to Jutland, then
                through the Danish peninsula to the Elbe, from there along the Elbe to the promontory that juts out
                between the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser at Ritzebüttel, from there along the Weser to Bremen, and
                finally from there to Wildeshausen and to the border of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. And since the
                geographical latitude and longitude of Copenhagen are without doubt precisely determined, and we now
                know for each point within this chain of triangles the exact geometric distance from Copenhagen to the
                west and south, the geographical latitude and longitude of each of these points can thus also be
                derived.
                <br>
                <br>By this means, astronomical determinations — particularly of longitude — made at locations where no
                permanently staffed observatory exists, and which therefore cannot be regarded as fully reliable, can be
                verified and corrected. For instance, the longitude of Oldenburg, which Mr. Wessel had determined from
                the aforementioned lunar eclipse observation in September 1783 to be 23° 14′ 11″ in time, corresponding
                to 5° 48′ 13″ east of Paris, turns out — according to the derivation from Copenhagen — to be 5° 53′ 41″.
                <br>
                <br>If this example, set by our sovereign authority and, to my knowledge, the first of its kind in
                Germany, were to inspire imitation, and if several such triangulation chains were drawn from places
                furnished with well-equipped and well-staffed observatories — for instance, from Berlin to Holstein for
                connection with the Danish triangulation system, from Berlin to Göttingen, from Göttingen to the
                Oldenburg border for combination with the Oldenburg system, from Göttingen to Mannheim, and so forth —
                then a long-expressed wish of eminent mathematicians would be fulfilled, and the best possible
                foundation for the geography of Germany would be laid.
                <br>
                <br>This extension of our triangulation system also serves to provide precise determinations of
                locations whose position is crucial for navigation — the mouths of the Elbe and Weser, those gateways to
                Germany, the Bremer beacon north of Budjadingen, Neuwerk with Skaarhörne off the aforementioned
                headland, and many others — all have now received accurate positions. To this end, another expansion
                toward the west was undertaken in the past year, as our present governing state administrator graciously
                ordered that the bay known as the Jahde, entering between Budjadingen, Jever, and East Frisia, together
                with the island of Wangerooge, upon which stands a lighthouse maintained from here, should likewise be
                charted, in the same manner as the chart of the Weser. Thus, as a foundation for this work, a
                triangulation chain had to be drawn along the Jever coast to Carolinensiel in East Frisia, including
                Wangerooge, which was executed by one of our geodesists, Mr. Behrens, with an accuracy confirmed by
                several rigorous trials, including agreement with Mr. Wessel’s operations.
                <br>
                <br>Now that Mr. Wessel’s preliminary work is being employed by the Hamburg authorities — not only for
                surveying the district of Ritzebüttel but also the coast and shore of the Lower Elbe and its mouth — and
                from our side the coastline from the East Frisian border, including Wangerooge, along the Jever shore,
                around the Jahde Bay and Budjadingen, extending into the Duchy of Bremen and to Ritzebüttel: from this
                will arise a correction of the utmost importance for navigation along the German coastline bordering the
                North Sea. The island of Helgoland may also be included, as it has been observed from Wangerooge; and if
                one considers the triangle HWN, formed by the three islands Helgoland, Wangerooge, and Neuwerk, then we
                from the Oldenburg side can contribute the angle HWN, being 69° 29′ 31″, and the side WN measuring
                140,962 feet, and the skilled Hamburg surveyor Mr. Reinke will hopefully supply the remaining data.
                <br>
                <br>These corrections are then incidental results of our local land survey, and of the mild and
                magnanimous disposition of our sovereign authority.
                <br>
                <br>I hereby conclude this first section of the present report on our land survey with the following
                table of the latitude and longitude of certain places, which also appears on page 166 of the German
                translation of Mr. Bugge’s book, but which, in regard to the names, is to be amended in accordance with
                the following; to which I also add Wangerooge.

                A national land survey must, as has been said, be founded upon trigonometric observations. Just as it is
                impossible to compose a faithful portrait from images of individual parts of the human face, so too can
                no precise and accurate map of a country of any considerable size be constructed from charts of small
                districts or field maps. The procedure must begin and proceed from the whole to the parts, from the
                larger to the smaller, down to the finest desired detail.
                <br>
                <br>When, through trigonometric operations, the positions of points carefully selected and distributed
                across the expanse of the entire territory have been determined — in relation to the cardinal directions
                and to one another, as well as their mutual distances — the whole then acquires its proper form, and the
                arrangement of the parts results from reference to these reliable points. The triangulated network
                spread across the land is like the skeleton of the human body; the filling out of this network by means
                of geodetic work corresponds to the clothing of the skeleton with flesh and skin. The work of the
                geodesists — however many there may be, and however usefully employed — whether they proceed from the
                interior toward the borders, or from the borders inward, will fit together; and their maps of the
                various surveyed parts of the country will, where they meet, coincide correctly, without overlapping or
                leaving gaps between them.
                <br>
                <br>The angle measurements in the trigonometric operations — both those of Mr. Wessel and of Mr. Behrens
                — were conducted using an "astronomical?" instrument (a detailed description of which may be found in
                Mr. Bugge’s treatise) with a diameter of two "Rhenish?" feet. A skilled observer can measure an angle
                with this instrument to within ¼ of a minute, or even 8–10 seconds; and it was rare for the correction
                of all three angles in a triangle to exceed 30 seconds. The measure of one angle is the result of eight
                distinct observations, and since the instrument's circle bears a double division of the limb, the result
                is in fact the mean of 16 readings.
                <br>
                <br>We later found that it is also possible, by means of the mensula, to determine an angle fairly
                accurately from the half-chord with respect to a given radius, provided that the mensula apparatus is
                equipped with a diopter rule and a telescope that can be affixed to diopters cut for this purpose; and
                if the station point on the mensula is positioned such that the sight lines enclosing the angle may be
                extended as far as possible, and the radius made as long as possible. Even in that case, the correction
                for all three angles has seldom exceeded 30 seconds. The reason for undertaking this experiment will be
                explained in the third section.
                <br>
                <br>As the entire country is a vast plain, and although it does not contain many true natural forests,
                it is nonetheless dotted with many planted groves around villages and individual houses, which greatly
                obstruct the view, it has not been possible to construct large triangles. The trigonometrist would
                certainly prefer larger triangles; yet here, necessity has indeed been turned into virtue, for the
                greater number of trigonometric points resulting from the small meshes of the triangulation network
                provide the geodesist with a correspondingly large number of control points — so that a mensula sheet,
                at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, will always encompass two or more trigonometric points.
                <br>
                <br>Since it is necessary in each triangle that all three angles be measured, all trigonometric points
                must be so chosen that one may take station there and erect the geodetic instrument. It is thus evident
                that buildings, churches, mills, and other such objects are not suitable for this purpose; rather, all
                these trigonometric points are, in a sense, ideal points, marked by numbered stakes.
                <br>
                <br>To ensure the preservation of these ideal points for use in geodetic work, the following provisions
                have been made. First, the stakes themselves are of a durable nature and driven in such a way that they
                cannot easily be lost. Secondly, those located on private grounds are entrusted to the property owners,
                while those situated on communal lands are placed under the care of local sub-bailiffs. Thirdly, each
                point has been charted in relation to the nearest immovable objects, and its distance from them
                measured, so that even if the stake should be lost, the point can still be recovered. As triangulation
                chains run along the entirety of our national border — and since some of the points have, with the
                consent of neighbouring territories, been established on their land — such neighbours may, should they
                so desire, make use of these points for their own geodetic operations, as has indeed been done by the
                Hamburg authorities with regard to the triangulation line running along the Elbe from Landwürsten
                upwards, so long as the stakes remain in place.
                <br>
                <br>From every trigonometric station, the entire horizon has been surveyed for notable secondary
                features — churches, mills, isolated houses, and the like — and for each of these, the angle formed
                between the line of sight to it and the adopted baseline was measured; so that, when one and the same
                object could be seen from multiple stations, its position could be derived through the intersection of
                the sight lines.
                <br>
                <br>The baseline that forms the foundation of the entire triangulation system was laid in the region of
                the Osen Hills, on the northern side of Sandkrug, and extended eastward beyond it. Its length is
                17,619.694 Rhenish feet. It was measured using rods with all conceivable care, including with the
                50-foot measuring rod, which yielded 17,636 feet.
                <br>
                <br>When a triangulation chain turns in a circular path and thus closes upon the same line from which it
                originally set out — the baseline — this return in itself serves as a test and verification. But when
                the chain proceeds in a straight line and ends abruptly, it becomes necessary to measure a line at the
                end in order to see how closely the computed and measured distances agree. Thus, Mr. Wessel measured
                such a verification line in the chain running along the Elbe near Hohensand in the land of Hadeln and
                found its length to be 7,490.2255 feet, while the computed distance was 7,489.48 feet — a difference of
                only 0.7455 feet. Similarly, Mr. Behrens, in the triangulation chain running through the Jever district
                toward Wangerooge, in which a line from Wessel’s system had been taken as a baseline without further
                remeasurement, measured a verification line on the shore opposite Wangerooge, near Friderikensiel, in
                the 25th triangle from the base, and found it to be 8,615.34 feet, while the computed value was 8,613.7
                — thus, a difference of 1.64 feet. These checks, together with that indicated in the first section and
                others that could be presented, sufficiently prove the precision and reliability of our operations.
                <br>
                <br>Imagine the meridian of the central point of the observatory mentioned in the first section — where
                now the pedestal for the sundial stands — extended north and south (more precisely, the tangent of this
                meridian at that point). Imagine further a perpendicular line running east–west to that meridian (the
                tangent of the parallel circle corresponding to the observatory’s latitude) at the same point. These are
                the two reference lines against which all trigonometric main points and secondary features are set in
                relation. Since, as noted in the first section, the inclination of the side of the triangle nearest the
                meridian is known — and thus also its inclination to the aforementioned perpendicular — and since all
                sides and angles in the triangulation system are interconnected and known, each side may be regarded as
                the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose legs are parallel to the meridian and the perpendicular.
                Since the angles are known, these legs can be calculated from the hypotenuse — that is, for each main
                point and for each secondary feature, the perpendicular distance from the observatory’s meridian east or
                west, and from the perpendicular to the meridian north or south, can be determined. Taking two such
                points, comparing their respective distances to the main lines, treating those differences as legs, and
                calculating the hypotenuse — that hypotenuse will give the direct linear distance between the two chosen
                locations.
                <br>
                <br>Let us take, for example, Oldenburg – that is, the point where the sundial stands upon the rampart –
                as well as Rastede and Varel.Rastede lies 2,980 Rhenish feet west of Oldenburg and 38,498 feet to the
                north; Varel lies 16,120 feet west and 92,568 feet north of Oldenburg; and Varel lies 13,140 feet west
                and 54,070 feet north of Rastede.
                <br>
                <br>Consequently, the straight-line distance between Oldenburg and Rastede is 38,613 feet, between
                Oldenburg and Varel 93,961 feet, and between Rastede and Varel 55,644 feet. The sum of the distances
                from Oldenburg to Rastede and from Rastede to Varel exceeds the direct distance from Oldenburg to Varel
                by 296 feet.
                <br>
                <br>The castle tower in Oldenburg lies 348.5 feet east of the observatory and 428.9 feet north;
                accordingly, Rastede lies 3,328.5 feet west and 38,099.1 feet north of the castle tower – making the
                direct distance between the castle tower in Oldenburg and the church tower in Rastede 38,214.4 feet.
                <br>
                <br>The following table provides the distances of the listed churches, some of the mills, and certain
                other objects within the territory, as well as some locations outside the territory, from the meridian
                of the observatory in Oldenburg (either east or west) and from the perpendicular to that meridian
                (either north or south). From these figures, both the direct distance of each location from the
                observatory in Oldenburg and their mutual distances can be calculated.
                <br>
                <br>It is noted that Altenhuntorf, Bardenfleth, and Hude are absent because they were not visible from
                any of the triangulation stations.
