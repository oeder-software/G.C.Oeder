                <h2>
                    My present thoughts on the inoculation against the cattle plague.
                </h2>
                In this matter, one must heed the prescriptions of sound public policy no less than the principles of
                medical science. To heal diseased cattle by means of medicines – we presently lack both the means and
                the method. The hope that both may one day be discovered I by no means reject.
                <br>
                <br>The path to such discovery, it seems to me, lies in this: that a sharp-minded man, endowed with a
                spirit of observation, carefully notes all the circumstances under which cattle that overcome the
                disease recover, in order thus to investigate both the nature of the disease and the ways by which
                nature herself works to overcome it.
                <br>
                <br>In such inquiry, he must first refrain from all personal intervention, from any attempts at healing,
                so that he may observe the unadulterated course of nature.
                <br>
                <br>This, with animals, is permitted him — and herein he is better off than the physician treating
                humans, who, in the face of a disease not yet studied or thoroughly understood, may not remain a mere
                spectator nor idle, but must act, however blindly, and attempt something, yielding both to the
                complaints of the patient and to the maxim: “It is better to attempt an uncertain remedy than none at
                all.”
                <br>
                <br>On the other hand, the veterinarian is worse off than the physician in this: that the latter always
                has at his disposal a considerable store of observations on the many and varied disease states of the
                human body — something that is sorely lacking in the case of animals, namely credible observations
                reported by trustworthy observers.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, all the more will the investigating physician of animals be on his guard against the deceptive
                conclusions drawn from the human body to that of animals, and against the seductive reasoning by analogy
                — or rather, not by analogy, since such is negligible, given the vast difference in internal organs and
                mode of life.
                <br>
                <br>The evil which cannot be cured must all the more be prevented, wherever that lies within our power;
                and if we lack that power, we must strive to bring about an outbreak of the evil in a lesser degree — in
                a degree which the forces of animal nature can more easily resist — should any opportunity for this
                present itself.
                <br>
                <br>To completely ward off the plague through effective police measures, or at the very first signs —
                while one may still apply the principle principiis obsta (resist the beginnings) — to destroy the few
                sick animals at the few places where it appears, and not the animals alone, but also all infection
                arising from them, all contamination clinging to the places where they stood and to the people who came
                near them: this is undoubtedly the best course, wherever it is feasible. And where it is feasible, talk
                of inoculation against the disease should, of course, be out of the question.
                <br>
                <br>States that are island-like or otherwise enclosed, bordered by neighbors along no very extensive
                frontier, could, one would think, ward off the disease — were they to restrict themselves to their own
                livestock production, importing none, exporting only, as Bornholm does. Or, if they must import (perhaps
                to improve the native breed), then only with the utmost caution, akin to the quarantine measures
                employed against the plague.
                <br>
                <br>But a state surrounded on all sides by neighbors along a wide frontier; one of moderate size and not
                self-sufficient, which cannot do without free trade in livestock with its neighbors, both for buying and
                for selling; to which, if the early police measures fail to achieve their aim, the imposition of a
                quarantine intended to halt the spread of a widespread outbreak would bring greater difficulties than
                the plague itself; a state which must ever be on guard against this lamentable enemy, who grants only
                uncertain truces of a few years’ duration; and in which livestock breeding forms a principal branch of
                the national livelihood — should such a state, if a means appears by which the evil might be lessened,
                the calamity diminished, and a stock or reserve of cattle secured, which, at a future outbreak, would be
                protected from infection so that at least no general devastation need be feared to bring ruin upon
                agriculture each time — should such a state not consider it reasonable not to reject such a path, but
                rather to embrace it?
                <br>
                <br>But is inoculation truly a means of procuring cattle that is reliably protected against the plague
                in the future?
                <br>
                <br>I am still far from being able to answer this question with an unqualified yes — just as I must
                reject any suspicion that I might, in any way, have a personal interest in recommending this
                inoculation. If further investigations should fail to confirm the usefulness of this operation, then I
                would indeed regret — for the sake of the public good — having to relinquish a pleasing hope; but I
                would be able to do so without injury to any self-conceit or attachment to my own ideas and projects.
                <br>
                <br>The undertaking in Denmark was not my own design; but I undertook it with all the readiness which my
                then-position and the public benefit of the matter required — yet also with full impartiality concerning
                the outcome, whether it should prove agreeable or contrary to expectations, as truth — which alone is
                useful — should demand. I have now taken up the pen so as not to leave incomplete a report on that
                Danish undertaking, which has appeared without my contribution; but I have no intention of once again
                engaging in such an affair, nor would my present position permit it.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, without making any absolute assertion of unquestionable reliability, I merely wish to submit
                for consideration the prevailing probability of the usefulness of cattle plague inoculation.
                <br>
                <br>1) This disease, like all such contagions that spread through infection, must surely have, somewhere
                in the world, an origin that precedes all transmission — just as, for example, our cereal crops
                undoubtedly have a native land, still little known to us, where they grow spontaneously or once must
                have grown, without having been brought there by human hands.
                <br>
                <br>But it is certain that this disease does not arise spontaneously in our part of Europe — indeed, not
                in any part of Europe — unless it has been introduced.
                <br>
                <br>Whoever claims the contrary must bear the burden of proving it — just as one who would assert that
                our cereal grains are indigenous to Europe must show where they grow wild, and furthermore, demonstrate
                that they could not have arrived there through cultivation already established in the region.
                <br>
                <br>2) With such contagious diseases, once they have gained entry into a country, there often remains a
                kindling — a smouldering residue — which, sooner or later, under favorable circumstances of weather or
                elemental conditions, of the constitution of persons afflicted with this latent spark, of the degree of
                communicability, and the like, may break out again into an epidemic. Just like a weed that has once
                spread across a country: under favorable conditions — which most of the time cannot be precisely defined
                — it may, even after seeming eradicated, suddenly multiply and spread anew.
                <br>
                <br>3) In smallpox — a disease belonging to this class of contagious and malignant illnesses — we have
                an example that, by means of a specific substance which can be captured and introduced into the
                bloodstream, the disease may be artificially induced at will. The same example, though still
                imperfectly, is found in measles, another illness of this class. And it is likely only for lack of a
                similar capturable substance in the other diseases of this class that a comparable artificial inducement
                of illness has not yet been made possible in them as well.
                <br>
                <br>4) The example of smallpox shows that the disease, when thus artificially induced, runs a milder
                course than when it arises by chance, and that it offers protection against future attacks of the
                naturally occurring disease.
                <br>
                <br>5) This analogy has, in the experiments conducted thus far, proven to hold reasonably true in the
                case of the inoculation of the cattle plague, yet a matter of this kind requires manifold confirmation
                through repeated trials.
                <br>
                <br>And thus there exists sufficient reason and encouragement to continue these experiments.
                <br>
                <br>An objection has been raised against the inoculation of smallpox, namely that the disease is thereby
                perpetuated. The same objection must likewise be expected in regard to the inoculation of cattle plague,
                and when such a concern is voiced by powerful neighbours, it may appear particularly grave. However,
                firstly, experience teaches that both of these diseases—smallpox and cattle plague—have already taken
                such firm root in Europe, that one may never hope for their total cessation and eradication, whether one
                inoculates or not. Secondly, it follows of itself that, just as smallpox inoculation must not occur
                without official restriction, so too the inoculation of cattle plague—indeed, it must not be permitted
                nor undertaken except at a place specifically appointed by the authorities, by persons duly
                commissioned, and under such measures to prevent dissemination from the designated site as a wise and
                prudent authority shall deem sufficient. Assuming, as one reasonably may, that no greater danger of
                airborne transmission exists in the case of cattle plague than in that of smallpox—against which no
                precaution could avail—then it lies within every government's power to provide assurance and to offer
                the guarantee that no spread of the disease shall arise from an inoculation sanctioned and conducted
                under its auspices. And this, one would think, ought to suffice for the reassurance of anxious
                neighbours—wherever reasoned representations may yet avail.
