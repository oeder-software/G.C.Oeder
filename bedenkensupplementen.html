                    I. <br>
                    Some considerations about the constitution of the National Militia in Denmark.

                </h2>

                If we estimate the land forces of Denmark at 15,000 enlisted men and 36,000 national troops, and compare
                the naval
                forces with 25,000 marines, then such a war force of 76,000 men is proportionally much stronger for a
                state with a
                population of 2,100,000 people than the war forces of the major military powers in Europe. Also, 51,000
                land troops,
                compared to the navy, seem really too much for a state whose circumstances—its location, its own
                maritime trade and
                shipping, and fisheries—demand the maintenance of a respectable navy. Denmark, which has relatively more
                experienced
                sailors to man its fleet than other maritime powers, actually gains respect and influence in Europe's
                balance of power
                through its navy, something that more populated states lack. All circumstances—the mountainous
                protection of Norway and
                the narrow isthmus connecting the peninsula to German soil—point to Denmark maintaining a land force
                solely for
                defensive purposes, which must, of course, be done efficiently.
                Even if 36,000 national troops are deemed necessary, actual Denmark, in contrast to Norway and the two
                duchies, can
                provide its population-proportionate share of this number and, more easily,


                <br> <br> <a id="a119" href="" target="">119)</a><br>the actual contribution it has always provided and
                continues to provide, which falls far short of its own population
                ratio compared to Norway. Denmark, I say, can deliver its contribution without having to bind its men
                between the ages
                of 4 and 40 if the true motivation outlined in the decree of February 4, 1733 (see above, Additions, p.
                116) does not
                merely serve as a pretext for the creation of a National Militia under the guise of national defense.
                <br><br>

                According to the census of the year 1769, which I may still well use as a basis, and where the exchange
                of the current
                Duchy of Oldenburg for the then grand ducal share of the Duchy of Holstein can make no significant
                difference, Denmark
                had 641,485, Norway 658,369, and the two duchies 382,515 inhabitants of the countryside, making a total
                of 1,682,369
                inhabitants in these three main parts of the state. Of 141,443 sailors, whalers, and children combined
                (of which 29,372
                were in Denmark, 21,771 in the duchies, and 90,300 in Norway), 119,421 were inhabitants of the
                countryside. Of these,
                18,240 were in Denmark, 83,593 in Norway, and 17,588 in the duchies. Therefore, excluding the sailors,
                there remain
                623,245 in Denmark, 574,776 in Norway, and 364,927 in the duchies, making a total of 1,562,948
                inhabitants of the
                countryside.
                <br><br>
                Out of these 1,562,948 Persons are
                <br><br>
                Denmark | Norway | duchies | Males<br>
                18327 ...| 19261 ...| 12652 ...| of age 21 - 24<br>
                35606... | 27083... | 22192... | of age 25 - 32<br>
                33034 ...| 27132 ...| 20296... | of age 33 - 40<br>
                ————————————————————————<br>
                86967 ...| 73476 ...| 55140 ...| of age 21 - 40<br>
                26040 ...| 22948 ...| 13651 ...| of age 41 - 48<br>
                ————————————————————————<br>
                113007 ...| 96424 ... 68791 ...| of age 21 - 48<br>
                <br><br>
                <br><br> <a id="a120" href="" target="">120)</a><br>Thus, the number of men capable of bearing arms
                between
                the ages of 21 and 40, in all three main parts of the state
                combined, is 215,483 men; those between 21 and 32 are 135,021 men strong; those between 33 and 40 are
                80,462 strong. If
                each of the three main parts of the state must contribute to a total of 36,000 men in proportion to its
                population,
                Denmark must provide 14,520, Norway 12,270, and the duchies 9,210, which would be roughly one out of
                every six men.
                However, Denmark and the duchies have never contributed according to their population proportion, and
                currently, as far
                as I know, Denmark provides 9,866 men, the duchies 4,214, and Norway 21,800 men, meaning Denmark
                provides approximately
                one out of every nine men from the population of those aged 21 to 40.
                <br><br>
                Now, further consideration must be given to what national troops are by their nature, and what they can
                be in Denmark,
                according to the state treasury and the annual sum allocated or possibly to be allocated for the
                maintenance of the land
                forces. Namely, they are men who are only away from home under arms for a small part of the year, while
                for the rest of
                the time, they remain engaged in their trade and livelihood, supporting themselves. They are subjected
                to military
                discipline during peacetime to become accustomed to order and the use of weapons, so that the state can,
                in the event of
                war, assemble an army of reliable men. Even in the most military-oriented states, it is well known that
                a large part of
                the soldiers, for the greater part of the year, are absent from their regiments and engaged in their
                trade, without
                being any less fit for field service, once they have been properly trained.

                <br> <br> <a id="a121" href="" target="">121)</a><br>How national troops are to be formed and kept in
                training is not my place to say, nor do I presume to know, except for
                the observation, which I cannot help but share with the approval of experts I have spoken to, that the
                most important
                aspect of forming national soldiers is to instruct and train them sufficiently from the very beginning.
                For this reason,
                their service time should be divided into two stages: the recruit stage and the actual soldier stage.
                During the recruit
                stage, which can last two years, they should spend a significant and continuous part of the year with
                the regiment,
                almost as if in school, so that they receive the necessary instruction, which would never otherwise be
                achieved, no
                matter how long the national soldier's service time is extended. Without this, the soldier would remain
                unskilled.
                However, once this training and discipline are instilled in him, it is quite sufficient for him to spend
                only a short
                time each year with the regiment to refresh his skills and learn a few new maneuvers, as is indeed the
                case in more than
                one of the exemplary armies of today.
                After this digression, if it may be called one, I claim nothing further, but I do know that Denmark,
                alongside its naval
                forces, cannot maintain an efficient land force other than by means of troops who provide the majority
                of their own
                subsistence during peacetime—

                <br> <br> <a id="a122" href="" target="">122)</a><br>thus national troops, who are also more reliable
                because
                they fight for their homeland. Consequently, Denmark can more
                easily recruit every ninth or tenth man from its population aged 21 to 40 for service as national
                troops, whether in its
                own uncombined regiments or in combination with enlisted troops in regiments made up of both. In
                peacetime, these men
                are only taken away from agriculture for a small part of the year, and beyond this, men under 20 and
                over 40, as well as
                a considerable portion of those between 21 and 40, remain available for agriculture.
                <br><br>

                For when I include men between the ages of 21 and 40, I do not mean to say that the young farmer should
                be obligated to
                military service for 20 years. Fifteen years, as has always been customary in Norway, may be more than
                sufficient in
                Denmark, and I would propose dividing this period into three stages or levels. The first stage would be
                two years,
                during which the young farmer would be regarded as a recruit; the second stage would be seven years of
                service in the
                field, in rank and file; and the third stage would be six years in the reserve, to be called up only
                when the regiment
                must mobilize fully, which would occur only in cases of necessity. It would depend on each individual
                whether the young
                farmer, based on his physical development and other circumstances, could be admitted to begin his
                military career as
                early as his 21st year, or a few years later.

                <br> <br> <a id="a123" href="" target="">123)</a><br>In general, the reserve stage would fall into his
                thirties, a time of married life, with which this reserve service
                would still be fairly compatible. Therefore, as stated, agriculture would still benefit from those
                between 21 and 40
                years of age who are not immediately admitted at age 21, as well as those who complete their service
                before reaching
                40..

                <br><br>
                One key factor in forming good national troops is that the obligation for this service must be universal
                for the farming
                class. This has always been the case with the Norwegian national troops, along with another favorable
                circumstance. The
                constitution of these troops has undeniable advantages, which is why they have been maintained without
                change or
                modification, despite the relatively large number of these troops. Meanwhile, regarding the small number
                of Danish
                national troops, there has been no end to modifications and regulations. Therefore, it is useful to
                reflect on these
                circumstances and their effects on the Norwegian national soldiers. The duty is universal, even for the
                sons of
                prominent farmers or landowners, who are usually owners of their farms and typically serve in the
                dragoon regiments, of
                which there are four, previously five. Because this duty is universal, it is no longer viewed as a
                burden and fosters a
                mentality well-known among Norwegian soldiers, which is unmistakable (as I have found, having had much
                interaction with
                Norwegian farmers, many of whom I found to be very clever people). The mentality is that the national
                soldier regards
                his duty as an honorable one.

                <br> <br> <a id="a124" href="" target="">124)</a><br>Because the obligation is universal, it also
                ensures
                proper rotation, so that no one can be held in service unfairly
                beyond their required service period. The eager youth naturally (during conscription) rush to begin
                their careers. The
                conflict between married life and military service is mostly resolved by the early start of this career.
                The national
                troops consist of young men with the strength and energy of youth, and the entire country is filled with
                combat-ready
                subjects who, even after completing their service, are still prepared, in case of emergency or an enemy
                invasion, to
                leave their hearth and home and rise in defense. To this advantage, derived from the universality of the
                duty, is added
                another fact: for farmers in Norway who do not own land, military service becomes a path to livelihood.
                <br><br>
                In Norway, there are no large estates; the land is divided into farms, and farms that are listed in the
                cadastral
                register under their own names may not be merged. A person who owns multiple farms can only personally
                manage the one he
                inhabits, unless he wants to pay double taxes; the rest must be leased out. This system already provides
                for the
                livelihood of many farmers who do not own land, and, as far as I know, though I am unaware of any
                explicit regulation,
                in cases of competition between a soldier and a non-soldier for such a vacant farm,

                <br> <br> <a id="a125" href="" target="">125)</a><br>preference is usually given to the soldier, though
                such
                cases are rare. I need not paint the contrast; the difference is
                notorious. Nevertheless, I am far from denying the Danish national troops the ability to equal the
                Norwegian ones. If
                only the constitution and circumstances were made similar to those in Norway, the same effects would be
                seen in Denmark,
                if not immediately, then certainly in future generations.

                The difference in the economies and livelihoods of the two kingdoms cannot provide a valid argument
                against introducing
                a uniform constitution for the national troops. It is true that the Norwegian sustains himself in a
                different way, but
                he uses just as much time and labor in his occupation as the Dane, and it is just as burdensome for him
                to leave his
                home and hearth with a rifle on his shoulder. Nevertheless, Norway, at least before 1760, provided
                28,000 men, more than
                half of whom could and were deployed outside Norway, while Denmark and the duchies together provided no
                more than 8,000
                men. The argument that Norway does not have the large estates found in Denmark and the duchies, which
                allegedly would
                not be able to operate under a similar constitution to Norway's, is also invalid. Solutions of various
                kinds would be
                found, and if adjustments are necessary, it is surely more reasonable that the management of large
                estates be modified
                to meet the needs of national defense, rather than the other way around.

                </h2>The Commission, of which I was a member from its establishment in October 1770 until the end of May
                1771, replaced a
                General Landwesen Collegium, which had previously existed. This Collegium had announced, through two
                preliminary
                decrees, a forthcoming determination of the feudal services (Frohndienste) and had required all
                landowners to report the
                nature of their estates, including the number of acres of manor fields and peasant land. The Commission,
                which was
                tasked with implementing what the Collegium had announced and promised in the name of the King, examined
                the information
                received about the estates and found a variation and fluctuation in the ratio between manor fields and
                peasant land,
                ranging from a ratio of 1 to 6, or even 7, rarely 9 or even 10, down to a ratio of 1 to 2. Undoubtedly,
                the extent of
                land that the feudal peasant possesses and uses is proportional to their capacity: thus, if all manor
                fields are to be
                covered by feudal services, the peasant should be able to cover the same burden, a ton of hard corn
                manor fields, in one
                place with a ratio of 7 or 6, and in another place with a ratio of 2 to 1! This is clearly unjust and,
                according to
                natural fairness and common sense, the burden should be proportioned according to the strength of the
                bearer, not
                according to the arbitrary and indefinite demands of those to whom the burden is owed.

                <br> <br> <a id="a127" href="" target="">127)</a><br>The origin of the discrepancy in these ratios was
                easy
                to explain. The original fair ratio, which was maintained on the
                royal domains (1:8 or 1:7), was altered over time on the estates of private individuals, who were often
                powerful men.
                This alteration involved reducing a part of the peasant land, as the expression goes, and adding it to
                the manor
                fields—an illegal abuse under the law. This abuse is all the more egregious because it weakens the
                feudal forces in
                proportion to the increase in burden. But what can be done? Tracking down the abuse and rectifying it in
                each place to
                its origin is a very burdensome task, and even if one could trace it back to the source, how could one
                hold those
                responsible accountable? It is true that such reductions remain a nullity in perpetuity, and the King
                could, by virtue
                of his right, annul any such reduction and order the restitution of the improperly added manor fields to
                the peasant
                land. However, each such case would be one where "summum jus, summum injuria" applies. The current
                landowners, even if
                innocent of the abuse, are bona fide possessors of the property, which has possibly been recently
                adjusted to its
                current state, and a recourse to previous owners is evidently impossible.

                <br> <br> <a id="a128" href="" target="">128)</a><br>Thus, we abstracted from this and adhered to the
                principle mentioned above that the burden must be proportionate to the
                capacity, a principle against which no alleged right can stand, and took as a measure of the feudal
                peasant's capacity
                his hard corn, i.e., his cadastral or matriculation data. We were aware of the imperfections in the
                matriculation
                records established between 1680 and 1690, imperfections which no cadastral record, however accurate at
                the time of its
                establishment, can ever fully escape. However, given the circumstances, a measure deemed fair and just
                by the Chamber
                was also acceptable to us, and we see no reason why we should be criticized for using the same measure
                to determine the
                feudal services owed to the landowner as the peasant's tax payments to the King and the Chamber's
                distribution of
                extraordinary burdens. Based on this principle and the actual needs of a landowner, we had land experts
                determine how
                many team services and how many manual services should be provided per ton of hard corn, throughout the
                entire year, and
                how many per week, especially during harvest time. We specified what types of work should be considered
                as a day's
                labor, when the farm day should start and end, what equipment the peasant should maintain for the
                landowner's service,
                and so forth. It is certain that on estates where there is no significant deviation from the old fair
                ratio between
                manor fields and peasant land, the landowner can manage quite well with the determination.

                <br> <br> <a id="a129" href="" target="">129)</a><br>We knew very well that landowners on estates where
                the
                manor fields are in such excess compared to the peasant land
                would not be able to manage and would complain. However, the Landwesen Collegium had already addressed
                these
                dissatisfied landowners in one of its aforementioned preliminary decrees, advising them to convert some
                of the surplus
                arable land into pastures or natural or artificial meadows, as indeed more land is under cultivation in
                Denmark,
                particularly in Zealand, than is suitable for livestock; or to lease part of it; or to allocate part in
                parcels to
                owners with some money against a canon; or to acquire more draft horses and service staff. Determining
                feudal services
                by days and by the principal distinction of services—whether just people or people with
                teams—undoubtedly has the
                advantage over other methods of determination because it eliminates all ambiguity and prevents
                misunderstandings and
                disputes. The peasant knows exactly how many days he is required to work, presents his receipts for each
                day, and does
                not need to keep books or accounts. He cannot be exploited or complain. The landowner, or his steward or
                tenant, can
                then apply the service as he sees fit for any purpose or type of task that requires the appropriate
                skills from the
                peasant. This approach avoids the need to address all questions related to specific workloads or the
                various tasks that
                arise in land management.

                <br><br> <a id="a130" href="" target="">130)</a><br>Enough, the farmer does every day what he is
                instructed
                to do, as long as it is something he, as a farmer, should and
                must understand. And so each such task is completed just as well, and in such a way that is fair, with
                the necessary
                expenditure of time and effort. Otherwise, when given an assignment as a whole, it is all too easy to
                exceed the
                reasonable measure of time and effort required.

                I have intentionally presented our reasoning in detail in order to show that our honest and
                well-considered approach
                does not deserve to be viewed with hostility or contempt, and that neither with assertions of power nor
                with the claim
                that experience has taught the impracticality of a precise determination of labor services, has anything
                been achieved
                to prove the contrary.
                How can one speak of experience when the regulation made by the Land Commission has barely remained in
                force for two
                years? And what has this experience taught us, other than what we already knew and what the Collegium
                foresaw before us,
                namely, that if a determination were to take place, on estates where there is much manor land and little
                peasant land,
                the fair amount of labor service allowed would not be sufficient for the sole cultivation of the manor
                fields. And those
                who could not get their way would reject any restriction and would raise cries of protest.
                And what will the impartial historian say one day after our time, when he sees that, following the
                expectations that the
                king's well-known sentiments towards the peasantry had raised,

                <br><br> <a id="a131" href="" target="">131)</a><br>and after the regulation first by a Land Commission,
                then by a Collegium, then again by a Commission, after two
                preliminary ordinances that announced a determination of labor services, the unlimited labor services,
                and after a third
                ordinance that contained such a determination, everything has finally come down to a fourth ordinance,
                in which these
                services were once again made and left undefined, and the laboring peasant was once again subjected to
                the discretion of
                the estate lord! Compare this history of the labor service ordinances with the summary history of the
                ordinances
                concerning the national troops, as found on page 85 in the Appendices.

                <h2>III. Example of a transformation involving the estate of Düttebüll in the Duchy of Schleswig by
                    means of subdivision
                    into parcels.

                </h2>
                Excerpt from a letter by the late Mr. Conference Councilor Ericius to me, Oeder, dated Schleswig,
                November 10, 1783.<br><br>
                “With Düttebüll, I undertook a large operation that turned out far better than I had expected. It was
                appraised at
                100,000 Reichsthalers — I was seriously considering selling it; however, that didn’t succeed, and I
                couldn't get 100,000
                Reichsthalers for it. So, I chose another path. I made my plan to divide the Pommerby manor and the
                village of Nieby
                into parcels to sell. This worked better, as you will soon hear. The sold parcels make up exactly 5/9

                <br> <br> <a id="a132" href="" target="">132)</a><br>of the entire estate. The parcels have been
                burdened
                with 20 ploughs’ contribution, but otherwise freed from all other
                taxes. The 4/9 that I kept for myself carry only 3 ploughs' contribution, and since I also retained all
                the woodlands,
                the quality of the land is better than that which was sold, I can confidently say that these 4/9, if not
                better, are at
                least just as valuable as the sold 5/9. And how much do you think I received for these 5/9? You will
                hardly believe it!
                76,000 Reichsthalers! If my remaining 4/9 are worth the same, then I have made 152,000 Reichsthalers
                from Düttebüll,
                which I couldn't sell for 100,000 Reichsthalers. In addition, I save 560 Reichsthalers annually in cash
                expenses for the
                20 ploughs’ contribution and 220 Reichsthalers for the head tax previously paid for the subjects. In
                total, 780
                Reichsthalers, which is the interest on a capital of 20,000 Reichsthalers, not to mention what I also
                save in building
                repairs, (support for) maintenance of the subjects, and the provision of firewood and timber for tools.
                As considerable
                as this profit is, the most joyful aspect for me has been that I could grant freedom to all 30 serf
                families on the
                estate, without charge, and provide the married portion of them with private land ownership under very
                favorable
                conditions. My future estate workers are all free people, who must perform certain agricultural tasks on
                the estate in
                exchange for the enjoyment of specific lands, under a contract to be drawn up in writing and terminable
                annually by both
                sides.

                <br> <br> <a id="a133" href="" target="">133)</a><br>Düttebüll, as it now is, including Cronsgaarde, can
                still support 230 Dutch cows and 20 household cows. I also retain my
                stud farm, and I can confidently calculate that I will be able to draw a free revenue of 3,500
                Reichsthalers annually
                from the estate. If you, dear brother (he was my late wife’s brother), desire any further clarification
                regarding my
                operations, since you have long preached about freedom and property, I await your instructions.”
                <br><br>
                It should be added to this account that, after the death of the late gentleman, Düttebüll, that is, the
                remaining 4/9,
                was also sold in parcels in the year 1785. Including the value of the livestock, 92,000 Reichsthalers
                were obtained, and
                in total, 58,000 Reichsthalers were gained through the dismemberment of Düttebüll.<br><br>
                This operation demonstrates how very feasible it is to improve the condition of a large estate by
                dissolving it, or part
                of it, into parcels, to the benefit of everyone—the landowner, the state, and the subjects.
                The late esteemed gentleman sold parts of the estate in order to rid himself of some debts attached to
                it and also to
                facilitate some household arrangements. However, for those who neither should nor wish to sell, as is
                always the case
                with princely domains, they could have placed the interest from the 76,000 Reichsthalers on the parcels
                as a form of
                canon (fixed annual payment).
                <br><br>
                Against one person rich enough to buy the whole estate, ten others can more easily be found, each
                willing to take on a
                tenth part.

                <br> <br> <a id="a134" href="" target="">134)</a><br>And for those who are able to buy such a tenth
                part, it
                is even easier to find others willing to take on the canon
                (annual payment), for which no purchase sum is necessary. These people can invest a few thousand thalers
                into such a
                parcel and put it to use in order to properly establish themselves by building their homes, acquiring
                household goods,
                livestock, etc. This invested property then serves, alongside the land itself, as collateral for the
                landowner.
                <br><br>
                This example given by the late Ericius aligns with the examples provided by the Royal Schleswig-Holstein
                Land Commission
                concerning the royal domains in both duchies, as noted in Mr. Court Councilor Schlözer's correspondence
                for the year
                1781, 9th volume, booklet 52, where a remarkable report can be found.
                <br><br>
                Regarding the examples mentioned from the Royal Danish States—apart from the example of the Bernstorf
                estate near the
                royal residence, which has been proven through many years of experience—there is no need for examples
                from countries on
                this side of the Elbe. Otherwise, I could reference the estate in which I currently live, formerly a
                Danish province,
                where, until the end of the last century, the condition of the peasantry was as it was almost everywhere
                else. However,
                since then, the peasantry has enjoyed full personal freedom. According to the payment lists from the
                census conducted in
                the Danish states in 1769, there were 1,220 people in Denmark, 1,539 in Schleswig, 1,333 in Holstein,
                and 1,736 in
                Oldenburg and Delmenhorst per geographical square mile, yet I cannot find any significant difference in
                their physical
                condition.

                <br> <br> <a id="a135" href="" target="">135)</a><br>Regarding the division into parcels, which are
                granted
                to their inhabitants with a fixed canon (annual payment) as
                possession, it is only one step away from the English system. The possessor of such a parcel remains
                tied, along with
                the parcel, in an inseparable bond with the estate, and the landowner is assured of a steady income that
                surpasses the
                previous yield. However, this income is limited once and for all, and the parcel holder becomes an
                owner, although still
                subject to the lordship of the landowner. If the landowner wishes to maintain free and unbound control
                for potentially
                increasing his income, he need only, if he has the means, build the dwellings himself—those that,
                according to the
                operations plan, the parcel holders would have built themselves—and take on the residents as temporary
                tenants. This
                way, after the lease period ends, the landowner always regains control of the parcel. In such a case,
                even though the
                tenants are freed from the burden of building houses and thus have less personal capital to invest,
                there will always be
                enough of them available, and their movable property will provide sufficient security for the landowner
                against
                deterioration. Any concerns about the payment of rent can easily be addressed through the prepayment of
                half a year's
                rent or by providing a security deposit.
                <br><br>
                The essential aspect of the operation of dismembering large estates, regardless of the specific terms
                agreed upon
                between the landowner and the parcel holders, lies in the fact that the area of land comprising such an
                estate is no
                longer managed as a single large operation.

                <br> <br> <a id="a136" href="" target="">136)</a><br>The products from the estate's fields are no longer
                brought into the sole barn of the landowner and sold for his direct
                benefit. Instead, the land is farmed by multiple small, distributed operations, and the products from
                these farms are
                brought into various barns and sold, benefiting the landowner indirectly but to a greater advantage. The
                landowner loses
                nothing but rather gains, and the state benefits because multiple families can make a living. The land,
                whose proper use
                ultimately underpins the state's prosperity, is utilized for a greater total yield. The farming of
                fragmented land
                compares to the farming of land held in large masses as the civilization of agricultural nations
                compares to the
                civilization of pastoral tribes. The more a nation is confined to a limited and non-expandable
                territory, the more it
                must manage its land carefully.

                    IV. Most humble petition concerning the extent to which personal freedom could now be granted to the
                    peasantry in the
                    Kingdom of Denmark.

                </h2>
                After having thoroughly examined, investigated, and considered everything that could in any way relate
                to the point most
                graciously entrusted to us—namely, the personal freedom of the peasantry—we are finally in a position to
                most humbly
                present this petition on the matter.

                <br> <br> <a id="a137" href="" target="">137)</a><br>This issue undoubtedly deserves the utmost
                consideration, both in regard to the political and economic constitution of
                the kingdom.
                That it would be most beneficial for the state and most honorable for Your Royal Majesty's scepter if
                every one of Your
                subjects could enjoy the freedom that entitles him to regulate his actions according to the laws is a
                truth that
                requires as little proof as this: that slavery is the mother of all vices, and that the condition of the
                peasantry here
                in Denmark, as a consequence of laws and decrees that have come to light from time to time, has now
                finally developed to
                the point where it approaches and resembles slavery, as the dominion under which the peasant stands,
                both de jure and de
                facto, carries with it a great deal of arbitrariness.

                The same motives that, 69 years ago, prompted Your Royal Majesty’s late father, King Fridericus IV of
                glorious memory,
                to abolish serfdom—namely, so that the peasant might have the courage, desire, and will to work
                diligently and eagerly,
                even to the point of risking his life for his king and country if necessary—these same reasons, in our
                opinion, are
                still just as valid today to bring about the freedom of the peasantry, a freedom they feel deprived of
                but which has
                long been intended for them.

                <br> <br> <a id="a138" href="" target="">138)</a><br>However, while it was easy for us to firmly
                establish
                and adopt the aforementioned general principle, it may prove just
                as difficult to determine the exact degree of freedom that the peasant, in the very moment he is to be
                freed from the
                yoke that currently burdens him, is capable of bearing. To give him, all at once, the full freedom he
                must eventually
                enjoy is something we cannot possibly recommend. A bird that has been kept in a cage from the beginning
                becomes lost and
                wild when the door is suddenly and unexpectedly opened, and we foresee with certainty that the same
                thing would happen,
                to the great detriment of the state, with the Danish peasants. The transition is too great and must not
                be made in one
                step.<br><br>
                We have an example of this right here in the country. When the land militia was completely abolished by
                the decree of
                October 30, 1730, there was nothing left to hold the peasants back. A general wandering around the
                country followed. The
                peasant left simply to avoid seeing the place he had been bound to any longer, and the disorder became
                so widespread and
                severe that the government felt compelled, at the beginning of 1733, to introduce a new land militia.
                From that time
                onward, subsequent decrees concerning the land militia, along with the decree of July 1, 1746, titled
                "Concerning
                Several Points Particularly Pertaining to Large Estates," placed the peasant in the position where he
                remains bound to
                the estate where he had completed his fourth year of life, unless the estate owner grants or sells him
                his freedom.



                <br><br>
                We are of the most humble opinion that, in order to prevent all feared harmful disorders, it is
                absolutely necessary to
                grant the peasantry


                <br> <br> <a id="a139" href="" target="">139)</a><br>their freedom gradually. Therefore, having
                considered
                the matter as carefully as its importance demands, we leave it to
                Your Royal Majesty to decide whether the first step toward achieving this great objective might not
                consist of the
                following measures:<br><br>
                1) That all peasant sons born since Your Royal Majesty’s accession to the throne, and those yet to be
                born, who have not
                already been entered into the reserve roll, should not be enrolled until they have reached their 14th
                year.
                2) That when a man has served 8 years as a soldier in the land militia, or has completed his term as a
                recruited soldier,
                or has reached his 34th year, or voluntarily takes on a farm, he should be removed from the roll; and
                that in the first
                two cases, it should not be prohibited for him to leave the estate and go wherever he pleases within
                Your Royal
                Majesty’s realms and lands.<br><br>
                3) All peasant sons must indeed be enrolled upon reaching their 14th year. However, if it is found at
                the next land militia
                session that they have a disability or physical defect making them unfit for royal service, they should
                immediately be
                removed from the roll and be considered, in all respects, as if they had served their time or reached
                their 34th year.
                4) That the proprietor should no longer be authorized to present recruits or to designate the man who
                should serve as a
                soldier at the militia session.

                <br> <br> <a id="a140" href="" target="">140)</a><br>4. Instead, when a vacancy arises, it should either
                be
                settled among the young men themselves as to which one of them
                would serve as a soldier, or, if they cannot agree on this, it should be decided by lot. We are also of
                the opinion
                that, to promote marriage, it might be wise to establish that as long as four unmarried men could be
                found who might
                draw lots in case of a vacancy, the married men should be exempted from this obligation.
                <br><br>
                We believe we may humbly submit these four proposals for Your Royal Majesty’s gracious approval, with
                the firm belief
                that their implementation will have a great influence on the prosperity of this realm, and particularly
                on the
                improvement of agriculture, without fear of any harm that could arise which might in the least compare
                to the benefits
                that will undoubtedly be gained from it.



                <br><br>
                Should this most humble proposal find favor with Your Royal Majesty, and should we be most graciously
                commanded to
                further elaborate upon it before a general order is issued, as the above has shown, the proposed changes
                will have an
                impact on the land militia, whose internal organization and structure we may not be as familiar with as
                necessary in
                this case. Moreover, some further arrangements and changes may need to be proposed, such as the holding
                of several
                annual sessions, and in regard to the fourth point, where the drawing of lots has been proposed instead
                of the landlord
                presenting the soldier, among other things that might need to be considered in a detailed proposal.


                <br> <br> <a id="a141" href="" target="">141)</a><br>Therefore, we most humbly request that Your Royal
                Majesty would graciously command General War Commissioner Schmidt, who
                is His Royal Highness's General Auditor with the Danish army and who has previously served for a long
                time as a war and
                land commissioner, and thus must possess all the knowledge of the internal structure of the land militia
                that we lack,
                to assist the commission as far as his insight and experience in these matters are deemed necessary.


                <br><br>
                General State Commission, the 17th of August 1771.Most humbly,Schumacher, Hoyer, Pflueg, Carstens.
                <br><br>

                I, Oeder, no longer a member of this Commission, from which I resigned at the end of May of the same
                year, present this
                statement not only because of its remarkable content in general but specifically as evidence that the
                spirit of
                moderation and caution, to which I have always sought to remain faithful, also guided my esteemed
                colleagues and
                generally prevailed in this Commission.

                    V. Closer Examination of the Existing Relationship between the Landowner and the Farmer Residing on
                    His Estate in
                    Denmark and Proposals.

                </h2>
                In this discussion, three distinct interests must be considered: the interest of the farmer, the
                interest of the
                landowner, and the interest of the state.

                <br> <br> <a id="a142" href="" target="">142)</a><br>
                The goal is to achieve the best possible alignment of these three different interests.

                <br><br>

                In this consideration, the following three principles should be established:<br><br>
                The farmer is a free man according to the law.<br><br>
                The landowner is the owner of both the farmland and the manor or estate land.<br><br>
                The state has the right to ensure that the land, which underpins the welfare of the state, is properly
                utilized and
                populated, and that the significant portion of its inhabitants who contribute to the cultivation of the
                land and its
                resources, without having ownership of land themselves, can lead fulfilling lives.


            </section>
            <section id="chap7"><br><br>

                <h2>Explanation of the first principle:
                </h2>Where the written law speaks, it is rather superfluous, at least here, to go back to older times,
                even to the Middle
                Ages, to the origins of the servitude of the peasants that the law has abolished. However, it is
                noteworthy how the
                power of prejudice and tradition has caused, after 85 years since Frederick IV's praiseworthy decree,
                supported by the
                most glorious and wise motives, that we still have to deliberate on how the farmer can be allowed full
                enjoyment of what
                an old law assures him. What is assured to the farmer by the written law is nothing more than personal
                freedom, which
                according to natural law belongs to every human being. It is no more than what the

                <br><br> <a id="a143" href="" target="">143)</a><br>least day laborer in the city possesses; it is
                nothing
                more than what the sister of the young farmer has long had no
                dispute over, and which has evidently only been denied to the young farmer himself until now. However,
                this personal
                freedom, which is nothing more, must be seriously impressed upon the farmer, just as the landowner must
                feel the
                striking unfairness of denying or disputing such a small matter. Moreover, the farmer must also be made
                aware of the
                true worth of such freedom through his own reflection and common sense.
                Should it not be expected that the farmer would speak to himself in this way:


                <br><br>

                “Free you are, and just as you owe thanks to God for life and health, so also give thanks to the King
                for this freedom,
                without which life is burdensome. But you are poor nonetheless; you have nothing but the use of your
                healthy limbs and
                your mental faculties, and you must sustain yourself through work. The nearest means of sustenance
                available to you is
                your father's trade, which you have already taken up or can and will take up. Other avenues are
                difficult, and wherever
                you turn, you must work to live. Where you were born, land is available for your use in exchange for
                dues that you must
                pay to the King and the owner of the land, and for services you must render to this owner. Apart from
                these conditions,
                you cannot demand the use of another's property.

                <br> <br> <a id="a144" href="" target="">144)</a><br>If the conditions seem too harsh, the law allows
                you to
                seek your fortune with another landowner and to explore other
                options. But be cautious, for the law and good order do not permit you to become a vagrant. Instead, ask
                the lawgiver to
                provide you with reasonable conditions.”

                <br><br>
                If, at the time of the ordinance regarding the land militia on February 4th, 1733, or even at the time
                of the ordinance
                on October 30th, 1730, the peasant had been fatherly and seriously advised on these considerations, and
                if, at the same
                time, a commission with subordinate district commissions (for which in each district already present
                officials, along
                with one or two estate owners, could have been appointed) had been established to address the
                inconveniences that might
                arise from the sudden transition of the peasant into an unfamiliar state of freedom, a commission that
                would have
                remained active until things had been properly arranged, and if then every peasant dissatisfied with his
                situation and
                seeking to leave the estate where he had resided so far, for himself and his family, would have had to
                report, state his
                reasons for dissatisfaction, present his prospects for other opportunities, and not leave without a
                permission slip from
                the commission—if, I say, such measures had been taken, then undoubtedly the disorder, the roaming of
                peasants from the
                estates, like a bird escaped from a cage,


                <br> <br> <a id="a145" href="" target="">145)</a><br>
                without knowing where to go, much spoken of and also mentioned in the nearby inserted report, could have
                been prevented,
                and it would not have been necessary to give the ordinance of February 4th, 1733, the motive that so
                clearly conflicts
                with the nature of a functional national militia, a motive that actually dishonors this militia.

                <h2>
                    Explanation of the Second Principle.

                </h2>

                The landowner is the owner of the peasant's land, but not of the peasants themselves and their families
                as an accessory.
                However, I assume from now on that landowners willingly renounce any claims rejected by the law. The
                landowner owns the
                peasant's land but under the legal restriction that it can never become manor land and must remain
                peasant land, on
                which the large class of country people who do not own their own land should find their livelihood. He
                should lease such
                land to such inhabitants, or, if he wishes, leave it for permanent possession under the best possible
                conditions for
                him, the landowner, but without coercion. And he, like all citizens of the state, must submit to the
                competition that,
                except in rare cases of necessity, alone determines the price of all things. He can be assured that, if
                he does not
                overreach in his demands, he will never lack tenants for his peasant land. For just as he needs such
                inhabitants, so too
                do the country people who do not own their own land need land to sustain themselves by the work of their
                hands; and they
                must also submit to the conditions that the landowners impose, as far as they are limited by the
                influence of
                competition.

                <br> <br> <a id="a146" href="" target="">146)</a><br>Because the government has decreed for the good of
                the
                state that peasant land must remain peasant land, the owner of
                such land cannot demand that the government forcibly provide tenants for him. For coercion must never
                take place except
                in cases of necessity, which is neither present nor anticipated here. However, he can expect the
                government, as it will
                undoubtedly do for the good of the state, to maintain order and prevent the outbreaks of discontent
                mentioned in the
                explanation of the first principle. I mentioned earlier the alternative of leasing or, if the landowner
                himself wishes,
                granting land for permanent possession; the latter seems unlikely under current thinking, but it may
                soon become
                possible, especially with a change of mindset. It could happen that a landowner who makes a change with
                his manor lands,
                where corvée labor becomes unnecessary or less useful, might find it appropriate to change the
                arrangement with the
                currently laboring tenant farmers (fæstebønder), converting their services into a monetary value,
                transforming this
                value, along with the already monetized land rent, into a perpetual rent, and granting the farm to the
                tenant, who is
                now only a leaseholder for life, as a hereditary lease for his descendants.

                <br> <br> <a id="a147" href="" target="">147)</a><br>
                I believe that the government cannot object to this, for as long as the farm remains a peasant farm, it
                should be
                indifferent whether the tenant holds it for life or as a hereditary lease. In fact, many improvements
                can be expected,
                particularly the division of the farm, for which many such peasant farms are well-suited, and this is
                easier in the
                latter case. Whether a landowner makes such a change with his peasant farms or retains or abolishes
                corvée labor must be
                left to him, and I always believe it is wiser to expect improvements to come from the enlightened free
                will of
                individuals rather than by command. That peasant land does not become manor land, and that laboring
                peasants are not
                overburdened, can be commanded as essential to the welfare of the state; nothing more. As for the manor
                lands, which are
                not under discussion in this explanation, no orders should be issued regarding how the owner should
                utilize them.

                <h2>Explanation of the third principle.
                </h2>
                One follows an important analogy when comparing the means of subsistence and the trades of people to
                religion and its
                practice, and in both cases, the government's intervention should be restricted to what is undeniably
                necessary for the
                immediate welfare of the state. One of the cases mentioned in the principle, where such necessary
                intervention
                occurs—namely, when one class is in danger of being oppressed by another—is indisputable.
                <br> <br> <a id="a148" href="" target="">148)</a><br>And, when it comes to the other case, where the
                livelihood of a class of inhabitants essential for the cultivation and
                defense of the country (and larger than any other) is concerned, one might doubt the derivation of such
                intervention
                from natural law. However, any dispute over this is superfluous in the present discussion. For in this
                matter, the
                written Danish law has already spoken—its ruling is even older than the one regarding the freedom of the
                peasants in
                King Frederick IV’s decree—and it is certainly a wise regulation that peasant land is strictly separated
                from estate
                land and can never become estate land. No European state has more reason to economize and conserve its
                land than
                Denmark, with the terrain of its islands and peninsula. Both together, considering the portion of the
                Duchy of Holstein
                acquired through exchange for Oldenburg, amount to no more than about 950 geographical square miles, and
                according to
                the 1769 census, they contain about 1,243,000 people, so that, on average, there are no more than 1,300
                people per
                square mile. It is undeniable that the division of land into large estates, latifundia, is far from
                advisable. Denmark
                loses greatly in comparison with Germany, which, except for its small coastal areas, lacks the
                advantages of shipping
                and fishing. It is also clear that Denmark cannot maintain an army without relying predominantly and
                reliably on
                national troops.


                <br> <br> <a id="a149" href="" target="">149)</a><br>Thus, the need for the aforementioned provisions
                for the
                peasantry is evident, making further elaboration unnecessary.
                However, any further interventions through commands are highly questionable, as they would lead to
                infringements on
                property rights, which must be sacred to every government and, in this respect, must be compared to
                religious tolerance.
                No matter how advantageous any suggestion or regulation might appear, either for the state or for the
                proprietor
                himself, if he were willing to accept it, it cannot, all things considered, outweigh the harm caused by
                dissatisfaction
                over coercion and the anxiety about the insecurity of property.



                <br><br>

                There is no form of intolerance, no religious coercion, that has not been justified by the greater
                interest of the
                church, or even by the salvation of the oppressed souls. But no one can complain about such insecurity
                of property when
                it concerns restrictions that have been enacted by the lawmaker due to their necessity and have been
                known for a long
                time, and such is the provision that peasant land should not be turned into estate land.
                The provisions concerning the national militia are undoubtedly a matter that solely depends on the
                discretion of the
                sovereign. The authority to keep the men of the estate together because a man is to be conscripted for
                every certain
                number of barrels, according to the official estimate,

                <br> <br> <a id="a150" href="" target="">150)</a><br>and to conscript the man who is to serve, has no
                connection whatsoever with the property rights of the landlord and
                disappears on its own without infringing on these rights if the king chooses to make another
                arrangement.
                The regulation that not only a selected few but every peasant’s son, in his turn, must serve the state
                does not make a
                significant difference in terms of agriculture as long as the number of those actually serving under
                arms remains
                roughly the same. Moreover, the general obligation provides for a more certain and quicker replacement
                of those serving,
                while eliminating many opportunities for arbitrary actions and variations. Thus, in short, landlords
                have no legitimate
                reasons based on rights to oppose an inevitably necessary change to the current structure of the
                national militia.

                <h2>Results and Proposals.
                </h2>
                From all these discussions, in conjunction with the preceding concerns and additions, as well as the
                newly added
                statements I, II, III, IV, which have been separated to avoid disrupting the flow of thoughts in the
                current discussion,
                I conclude that, taken together, the following well-intentioned proposals emerge as results.

            </section>
            <section id="chap11"><br><br>

                <h2>First Proposal
                </h2>Care for the preservation of peasant farms (Fæstegaarde) and the prevention of their abandonment,
                as well as any
                conversion of peasant land into estate land. To this end:<br><br>
                1. Revision of the land register (Matrikul);

                <br><br> <a id="a151" href="" target="">151)</a><br>
                2. Compilation of an accurate list of peasant farms on each estate, noting the size of each one and the
                name of the current
                and subsequent resident (Fæstebonde);<br><br>
                3. Communication of this list to the district administrators and the enrollment office;
                4. Enforcement of the prohibitions on abandonment, with permission to divide the larger Fæstegaarde
                (Farms) and
                encouragement for such division.

            </section>
            <section id="chap12"><br><br>

                <h2>Second Proposal
                </h2>
                Regulation of compulsory labor (Frohndienste), and to that end:<br><br>
                1. Restoration of the ordinance from 1771 to regulate compulsory labor;
                2. Or the prompt creation and publication of a new one, if a better and fairer regulation can be
                devised; whereby
                3. Communication of the intent that such legal regulation is to be considered as temporary, and that in
                the future, when
                the tenant farmer (Fæstebauer) is in full enjoyment of his freedom and able to negotiate with the
                landowner, it will be
                left to them, the landowner and the farmers, to agree on the terms of compulsory labor as free
                contracting parties.
                However, until further notice, the compulsory labor ordinance cannot be disregarded.

            <section id="chap13"><br><br>

                <h2>Third Proposal
                </h2>

                Change to the Constitution of the National Militia or specifically the Enrollment System:

                <br> <br> <a id="a152" href="" target="">152)</a><br>
                1. Abolition of the modi præstationis, under which one man for 40 or any fixed number of barrels
                (Tonnen) of hard grain
                (Hartkorn) is conscripted by the proprietor;<br><br>
                2. Release of the landowners from the obligation of such prestations, and abolition of their right to
                personally conscript
                those designated for service;<br><br>
                3. Expansion of the obligation to serve the country under arms for a set period to all farmer's sons fit
                for military
                service;<br><br>
                4. Establishment of a priority right for national soldiers to fill vacancies at tenant farms
                (Fæstehöfe);<br><br>
                5. Formation of a mixed enrollment board, comprised of both civil and military members, for each of the
                enrollment
                districts to be established, subordinated to a similarly mixed general board;<br><br>
                6. Classification of farmer's sons and the militia into the following categories: <br>
                a) Boys' class from birth until
                confirmation;<br>
                b) Youth class from confirmation until the end of their 20th year;<br>
                c) Recruit class from the beginning of
                the 21st year until the young man is declared fit for service;<br>
                <br> <br> <a id="a153" href="" target="">153)</a><br>
                d) Soldier class from the time they are declared fit for service in the field until the end of their
                29th year; <br>
                e) Reserve class, from the 30th to the end of the 35th year of age, to be called to service only in
                cases of emergency,
                when the personnel from class d is insufficient to meet the demands of the times. If not universally,
                then at least for
                individual cases, and depending on the circumstances—of which physical maturity is the most
                significant—it could be
                considered to begin the period of service earlier, at the age of 20 or even 19. In such cases, the
                service would end at
                the age of 34 or even 33, which would be better to avoid conflicts with marital life. However, this
                decision is left to
                the individual assessment of the recruitment commissions.
                <br><br>
                7. Further regulations concerning these classes: <br>
                a) The local priest must annually provide a list of the boys' class, summarizing the confirmation list,
                to the district
                administrator (Amtmann);<br>
                b) A similar list for the youth class is to be shared with the enrollment board of the district;

                <br> <br> <a id="a154" href="" target="">154)</a><br>
                c) The said direction shall have these young men appear before them, examine them, and decide which are
                fit for military
                service and should be prepared for it. From that time on, those deemed fit will be listed in the
                enrollment rolls as
                recruits, while those found unfit for military service, or their fathers or guardians, will be provided
                with a
                corresponding certificate. <br>
                d) These individuals shall not be considered dismissed from the canton, nor shall those recorded on the
                recruit list,
                based on the request of their fathers or guardians, be allowed to remain outside the estate or even
                outside the canton
                for their advancement without permission from the direction, while maintaining their ties to the canton.
                <br>
                e) Those belonging to the recruitment class, upon reaching their 21st year or, depending on the
                situation, their 20th or
                19th year, must appear at the enrollment direction, always at the next regular session following such
                appearance, to
                determine whether they will enter service or not, and will be provided with proof that they have
                appeared.

                <br> <br> <a id="a155" href="" target="">155)</a><br>f) If more recruits report than are needed, the
                selection will be determined by lot;
                g) Those not selected in one session shall have priority for selection in the next session;
                <br>


                h) If someone who belongs to the recruits or already to the soldiers wishes to stay outside the parish
                or canton for
                employment or sustenance, he must seek permission for this first from his company commander and then
                from the enrollment
                authority. If permission is granted according to the circumstances, he will receive a pass as a leave of
                absence. <br>
                i) If someone in the soldier class finds the opportunity to marry while taking over a farm or otherwise
                marries within
                the parish or canton or even outside such a district, he must first seek permission in the
                aforementioned manner from
                the captain, and subsequently from the authority. This permission should not be denied without
                significant reason, while
                always retaining his connection to the canton.

                br

                k) If, in special cases, it is found that marriage is incompatible with military service, which
                generally cannot be
                asserted, it should be considered whether the individual seeking permission

                <br> <br> <a id="a156" href="" target="">156)</a><br>to marry is still far from achieving his soldier
                status
                or not, and whether he has assets or benefits from the marriage
                or not. It should also be considered whether he is taking over a farm through the marriage or not.
                Managing a farm seems
                least compatible with military service, but according to the order and as proposed in subsection m, such
                an individual
                coming to a farm would not be far from the goal of his service. If he is still far from this goal and
                must be released
                from his obligations, allowing another to take his place, and if he has some assets, he should pay a
                modest fee to the
                canton, which would be used to support his less fortunate comrades in case of illness or similar
                circumstances. In all
                cases where long-term service is required, married individuals should be spared as much as possible.



                l) No one shall be obligated to serve beyond their respective 29th or 35th year, or generally beyond a
                service period of
                15 years, whether they enter actual service earlier or later. <br>
                m) In the case of establishing the farms, strict priority must be given to a national soldier,
                especially to the one who
                has served the longest in actual <service class="br"></service>

                <br><br> <a id="a157" href="" target="">157)</a><br>
                n) Those who wish to remain in military service should be given the prospect of non-commissioned officer
                positions among
                the recruits, based on their demonstrated behavior and competence among the nationals. <br>
                o) The officers who are involved in the training of the national soldiers (a training that must wisely
                combine
                seriousness with lightness) must have their achievements recognized as a recommendation for their
                advancement, and they
                should be instructed to regard this task not as a setback but as very important and worthy. <br>

                    Fourth Proposal.
                </h2>
                Measures to Prevent Potential Disorders During the Transition of the Peasants to Freedom:<br><br>
                a) This transition shall not be postponed any longer, but shall begin immediately, in accordance with
                the decree issued
                85 years ago;<br><br>
                b) A Freedom Commission shall be established in each district, chaired by the district administrator,
                under the general
                direction of the chancellery. A couple of royal officials from the vicinity, along with a few landowners
                and the pastor
                of each parish (as far as it concerns the residents of that parish), shall be appointed to this
                commission.

                <br> <br> <a id="a158" href="" target="">158)</a><br>
                c) Anyone wishing to leave the estate for themselves or for their dependents (guardians for their
                wards), specifically
                males (since females do not require this), must report to the Freedom Commission, presenting their
                reasons for wanting
                to leave, along with the proposed means of sustenance they intend to pursue elsewhere. It should be
                noted that the
                requested permission should not be denied without significant objections, and this shall be granted
                through a freedom
                pass that outlines their intentions.<br><br>
                d) However, no existing contracts shall be broken, and no abandonment of an estate shall be permitted.
                The peasant who
                feels wronged must have their complaint heard, but if they are found to be in the wrong, they shall be
                referred to

                e) The military obligation of any male individual for whom such a freedom pass is sought shall remain
                with the canton to
                which they belong. Thus, if the granting of the freedom pass is deemed permissible, consultation with
                the enrollment
                direction must be made before the actual issuance of the pass, and approval must also be obtained.

                f) The continuation of this Freedom Commission could well last until the expiration of the already
                concluded tenancy
                contracts and until the current generation passes away; however, it should be communicated that it is
                intended, in the
                future, once matters have been clarified, to reinstate these commissions.

                <h2> Fifth Proposal:
                </h2>

                Establishment of a special tribunal to resolve disputes and conflicts arising from the nexus between
                landowners and farmers.




                At all times, even with the wisest precautions, errors and disputes will not entirely disappear. These
                could certainly
                be left to the ordinary courts for the future when the farmer achieves full enjoyment of freedom, and I
                am not in favor
                of the multiplication of entities. However, in the case of the kinds of disputes being discussed here,
                various special
                circumstances arise.
                <br><br>
                a) Landowners and farmers have their own special forum;<br>
                b) on large estates, counties, and baronies, the landowners themselves have jurisdiction, and in such
                cases, the
                landowner who presides over the court would be both judge and party at the same time;<br>
                c) in such matters, claims and counterclaims could often arise;<br>
                d) the higher forum of the landowner, if the farmer should seek it there, is too costly for this humble
                man.

                <br> <br> <a id="a160" href="" target="">160)</a><br>e) And these disputes are generally of such a
                nature
                that they are better suited for arbitration than for formal legal
                proceedings and judgments. These particular circumstances seem to make it advisable to establish a
                tribunal, with
                subordinate courts or delegations for each office, which would be constituted in such a way that even
                the landowners, up
                to the higher nobility, would not be excluded, whose forum could be recognized without humiliation, and
                where summary
                procedures and more oral proceedings (since the manager can represent instead of the noble or distant
                landowner) can be
                prescribed over written proceedings. The members could be individuals residing in the office or province
                (districts),
                and a couple of sessions per year would hopefully be sufficient.
