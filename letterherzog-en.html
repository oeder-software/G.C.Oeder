                <h2>Oldenburg, 2nd May 1787.</h2>
                Serenissimo.
                Most Gracious Lord!
                <br>
                <br>As is known, I was transferred from Denmark to my current position against my will, and I would have
                persisted in my protest against it — the certainly valid protest of a non-jurist against a judicial
                office — had not the Minister of State, Count von Bernstorff, also my patron just as his unforgettable
                uncle was to me, informed me that it was in fact he who had arranged this transfer in order to spare me
                undeserved and well-known adversities. He also assured me that I would be most warmly recommended to my
                new Lord.
                <br>
                <br>I soon experienced the effect of this recommendation, and the grace of my Lord, now resting in God,
                quickly reconciled me to my new situation. In this position, I have now spent nearly 14 years in peace
                and contentment, and my heart harbors no other wish than to conclude my remaining days in the service of
                Your High Princely Serenity — in peace, that is, in activity as long as God grants me strength, joined
                with tranquility of mind.
                <br>
                <br>Now, however, a difficulty arises that threatens this peace of mind and contentment, stemming from
                the disadvantageous circumstance that I receive fees (Sporteln) instead of a fixed salary. This
                difficulty would, however, be instantly removed if Your High Princely Serenity would graciously grant me
                a fixed income equivalent to my previous earnings from fees, for which I most humbly petition.
                <br>
                <br>I willingly concede the inconveniences of the fee-based system, and I respectfully recognize Your
                most praiseworthy intentions in the recently issued ordinance concerning legal procedure. But it is
                highly likely that this will result in a significant reduction of fee income, and I do not deserve — nor
                is it surely Your Serenity’s intention — that I should suffer innocently as a result.
                <br>
                <br>Consider, Most Gracious Lord,that this post as Landvogt was to serve me as a replacement for a
                position as Stiftsamtmann, which ranks among the most significant in the state, and that Your High
                Princely Serenity is to me what His Majesty the King once was;
                <br>
                <br>Consider, Most Gracious Lord,that no sovereign deprives a servant who has committed no fault of a
                portion of the salary once granted, and that fees (Sporteln) are in place of a salary;
                <br>
                <br>Consider, Most Gracious Lord,all of this — and bring joy to an aging man who has endured enough
                unrest in his life, who would gladly give thanks to Your High Princely Serenity, from his innermost
                heart and with deepest devotion, for the undiminished preservation of his well-being, which is also the
                well-being of a family. A man who has proven himself to be a diligent servant, and whose diligence will
                continue to be enlivened by the grace of his Lord — grant me joy through the most gracious fulfillment
                of my petition.
                <br>
                <br>Oldenburg, 2nd May 1787.
                <br>In deepest humility,

                <h2>
Oldenburg, 18 January 1788.
                </h2>

                P. M.
                <br>
                <br>Permit me most graciously, Most Gracious Lord, to present the following most humbly, in
                clarification of the passage in my essay which Your High Princely Serenity deigned to remark upon with
                the letter B.
                <br>
                <br>Your High Princely Serenity seems to view the said passage as something which might first give rise
                to the suspicion among subjects that the purpose of the land survey could be to impose a burden upon
                them. But, Most Gracious Lord, the prejudice truly already exists and is widespread. Not only have I
                myself observed signs of it and can relate a remarkable example thereof, but others — who have more
                occasion than I to hear what is spoken among the public (among whom I would especially name Mr. Forest
                Master Ahlers) — have assured me of it. Indeed, it is likely no exaggeration to assume that the majority
                of people throughout do not deem it possible that a plan for a land survey could be conceived without
                self-interested motives, without knowing how one might soon at least recoup the costs.
                <br>
                <br>Now, Your High Princely Serenity, conscious of your fatherly intentions toward the land, can of
                course rise above such prejudices, and I too, in the execution of my honorable commission, have no need
                to fear such prejudices. Nor is the aforementioned passage intended as an apology on behalf of either
                Lord or servant, but merely as instruction for the public, to explain how the entire report on the land
                survey is to be understood. And such instruction appears not only useful but necessary — as indeed the
                aforementioned Mr. Ahlers expressed his delight to me, that I had, in the way I did, addressed this
                prejudice which had often caused him irritation.
                <br>
                <br>One cannot, Most Gracious Lord, be a more zealous advocate of liberty and property than I am in the
                aforementioned printed memorandum; I have, in that very document, on page 134, even mentioned Oldenburg
                by name*), and I have noted that, during the census of the year 1769, this land showed itself to be the
                most densely populated province among the Danish states — and I have traced this distinction back to
                that very source. Thus, I not only gladly grant our Oldenburgers their lively sense of liberty and
                property, but I also highly praise it. Yet no Oldenburger, however jealous he may be in matters of
                liberty and property, will deny the two propositions: that land not yet cultivated, as long as it is not
                actually designated for cultivation, belongs to the sovereign; and that every improvement to the
                prince’s revenues which can occur without harming the subject is laudable and desirable.
                <br>
                <br>I do not believe, moreover, that the few remarks I make in order to counter the aforementioned
                prejudice could rightly be called controversial. I simply wish to present what I have to say, along with
                the reasons for it — and this cannot be done without touching upon and addressing the opposing
                arguments.
                <br>
                <br>Therefore, all things considered, I would gladly, if it may occur with Your High Princely Serenity’s
                approval, retain the aforementioned passage, for if it were to be omitted, the moral I intend to convey
                would also fall away — and, more generally, much of the benefit and purpose of my entire essay, namely
                the instruction of our native public (which, indeed, is truly in need of instruction in many things,
                especially regarding the mathematical part of the matter), would be lost.
                <br>
                <br>Oldenburg, 18 January 1788.
                <br>Most humbly,
                <br>G. C. Oeder

Oldenburg, 20 January 1788.
                </h2>
                <br>P. M.
                <br>If, in the passage marked B, which currently reads:
                <br>“Just as this undertaking, in its execution, has not been a burden to the country at large — not
                even through any form of unpaid labor — so likewise it will not, in its consequences, cause any harm to
                any landowner. (And selfish ulterior motives are just as surely not to be attributed to our prince’s
                character as it is certain that an improvement of the state and its revenues, if it can be achieved
                without harm to the subjects, is praiseworthy.) With equal confidence and modesty etc.”
                <br>— a period were inserted after the word gereichen a) in place of the comma, and the parenthetical
                words omitted, then it seems to me that the passage might be viewed as a gentle and moderate allusion to
                a truly existing prejudice, which is unfavorable toward our gracious sovereign — a word spoken in due
                season, which anyone whom it concerns may take to heart.
                <br>
                <br>To the passage A, the following words are added:
                <br>“The map speaks to the eye and presents it directly with the answer to a hundred questions, whose
                oral or written answer would always be lengthy.”
                <br>
                <br>With deep gratitude, I acknowledge the gracious attention that has been given to my essay.
                <br>
                <br>Oldenburg, 20 January 1788.
                <br>Most humbly,

                <h2>
Oldenburg, January 22nd, 1788
                </h2>

                <p>
                    <br>P. M.
                    <br>The accompanying pieces I received last night. No one here knows, apart from Your High Princely
                    Serene Highness and Count von Holmer, that I had the article inserted, and I would prefer to remain
                    unknown for a while yet; and even if I were to be guessed, I would still maintain the incognito – to
                    keep silent, not to acknowledge myself as the author, and least of all to announce it myself.
                    <br>
                    <br>The irritating misprint on page 371, line 3, is not my fault. I enclose Mr. Schlözer’s letter,
                    which I really ought to withhold as being overly flattering, nevertheless, because I trust that you,
                    Gracious Sir, will credit me with the readiness to apply a proper discount to the praise, and
                    because I believe Your High Princely Serene Highness will otherwise find the letter of this
                    remarkable man interesting enough. I gladly admit to a fatherly predilection for this treatise of
                    mine.
                    <br>
                    <br>A hint about it from Your High Princely Serene Highness in Saint Petersburg may perhaps not be
                    unhelpful — perhaps even not unwelcome. Without naming the author, as I must request: should there
                    be an inquiry as to the author, further consideration of what to do may be required.
                    <br>
                    <br>Into the Danish entanglement I will not uninvited a) involve myself. The conduct of the
                    gentlemen in Copenhagen toward me in past years was such that any inclination toward thankless labor
                    may easily vanish. And yet, I have been repeatedly — I might almost say to the point of weariness —
                    assured that His Royal Highness the Crown Prince esteems me most highly, and has read my various
                    writings with interest and warmth. His Highness thus knows me, and if he truly has confidence in me,
                    he may call upon me. I genuinely believe — and I say it without boast — that I might be capable of
                    untangling the chaos of Danish finances, and assisting the young prince, who may find himself in
                    considerable difficulty among the factions, where surely not a little cabaling takes place. The
                    foundation has been laid by my treatise, for which Denmark indeed served as the original model for
                    the painting. The key lies in showing the correct path with such clarity that the erroneous ones
                    reveal themselves as such — without polemics, which only tire an old man like myself, now 60 years
                    of age, and confuse a young prince. The right path is only one — the erroneous ones are many.

                <h2>
18th November 1788.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most Gracious Sir!Encouraged by the approval with which Your Most Serene Highness has honored my
                    essay on paper money in the 43rd issue of the Schlözer’s Gazette, I now take the liberty of also
                    laying before Your Highness the enclosed isolated sheet from the 47th issue, on account of the
                    article it contains from page 310 to 316. I also believe that the enclosed excerpt from Mr.
                    Schlözer’s letter may not be unwelcome.⁽⁰⁸⁾
                    <br>
                    <br>I have likewise shared with Mr. Schlözer a certain manuscript which was also presented to Your
                    Highness this summer through Count von Holmer, though with the express prohibition against
                    publication. It is the one referred to with the letter A in Schlözer’s letter, and it contains, as
                    Your Highness may recall, three essays: a précis, comments on the précis, and a reply to the
                    comments.⁽⁸⁰⁰⁾
                    <br>
                    <br>I have excerpted the portion relating to Mr. Krüdtner, since I have heard something similar from
                    another source, and because it shows that Mr. Schlözer maintains rather good correspondence.
                    <br>
                    <br>As for the high price of the Hamburg courant, I believe I can explain it as follows. There does
                    not exist much Hamburg courant in general, and most of the courant that, until the recent reforms in
                    Hamburg—and indeed wherever the Lübeck coin standard has been adopted—was commonly in use, was
                    Danish. But now this Danish money has, as it were, been scraped out and poured away, fallen into
                    disrepute, and has even been officially withdrawn from circulation by the Danish government itself.
                    Hamburg, however, in a proclamation occasioned by the Danish currency reform, has declared to its
                    citizens that only Hamburg courant shall be accepted in the coffers of the city. Since there is not
                    enough of it, its price rises, as does the price of any item in high demand. The highest rate of the
                    courant against banco, according to the coin standard of 11½ Reichsthaler per Mark, is 100:122, but
                    it is currently at 100:119, and was recently even at 100:117. Hamburg should, instead of locking its
                    coffers to all courant but its own, have merely excluded the Danish one, and admitted the courant of
                    its other neighbors—Lübeck, Mecklenburg, and Lauenburg. However, Hamburg presumably did not wish to
                    exclude the Danish specifically, out of respect and consideration for Denmark—although, in my
                    opinion, it might have done so properly, since Denmark itself recalled its own courant. Lastly,
                    Hamburg will now likely be compelled to admit the courant of the neighboring states, due to the
                    insufficient mass of its own currency for everyday commerce, and will also have to mint more of its
                    own small change.
                    <br>
                    <br>In Holstein, it is believed that all danger of a Prussian invasion has passed, and people
                    rejoice over it more than they dare show in the presence of the government. I fear, however, that
                    the said invasion is still possible—indeed, likely—should an actual rupture occur between Russia and
                    Prussia. In that case, Prussia’s interest would require that Sweden remain an enemy of Russia.
                    Should Denmark then persist in assisting Russia—even in the manner of the modo praestationis—then
                    Prussians, and likewise Hanoverians, will again stand ante portas Holsatiae, and an English and
                    Dutch fleet for pacification will be in the Baltic Sea come spring. I see more than just the
                    possibility that Denmark will be forced to withdraw entirely from its alignment with Russia; and if
                    Mr. Krüdtner has indeed spoken as reported, then it was very premature.
                    <br>
                    <br>With hope for the pardon of my reasoning
                    <br>18th November 1788.
                    <br>and with deepest humility,

                <h2>
Oldenburg, 18 February 1790.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most Reverend and Most SereneBishop and Duke!Gracious Lord!
                    <br>
                    <br>In taking the liberty to lay before Your Serene Highness the enclosed book, on account of the
                    essays therein concerning the population of the Danish states, I venture to raise the question
                    whether it might not be advisable, now that twenty years have passed since the census conducted in
                    this land, to repeat this operation.
                    <br>
                    <br>All the more so since the plan for the census taken on the 15th of August, 1769, was not well
                    devised, and its results are not sufficiently reliable.
                    <br>
                    <br>If we undertake the operation once more, properly as it ought to be done, the repetition of it
                    may thereafter be deferred for a generation or longer. For once we have ascertained the correct
                    proportions of the annual births, deaths, and marriages relative to the total of people living at
                    the same time, we can subsequently, by multiplying the said annual changes (provided that these,
                    which is not difficult, are correctly noted and properly reported), by such factors find the total
                    number living at any given time.
                    <br>
                    <br>I would think that, after the experience of the gracious rule of two princes from the present
                    reigning house, the inhabitants of this land—if ever they were capable of such suspicion—are now no
                    longer inclined to the mistaken notion that a census must be seen as a harbinger of taxation.
                    Rather, even the more simple-minded will comprehend a portion of the manifold useful information
                    which such a count may furnish to the sovereign, and which will become apparent to the more
                    discerning upon a little reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br>Should Your Most Serene Highness deign to make use of my assistance in this operation, it shall
                    be my honor to render service also in this matter of public utility, and to help ensure that this
                    operation may likewise become exemplary to the general, both foreign and domestic, public.
                    <br>
                    <br>Gracious Lord!
                    <br>To Your Most Serene Highness
                    <br>Oldenburg, 18 February 1790.
                    <br>Your most humble servant

3rd November 1790.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most Gracious Lord,
                    <br>
                    <br>His Excellency Count von Holmer, as he has informed me here, has already in Eutin shared certain
                    reflections concerning the proposed new Danish Species Bank, originating from my pen, with Your Most
                    Serene Highness, and also disclosed that I am in the process of preparing another essay intended for
                    insertion in Mr. Schlözer’s Staats-Anzeigen. I herewith most humbly submit this essay also to Your
                    Most Serene Highness, encouraged thereto by the approbation which my first essay on paper money, in
                    the forty-third issue of Schlözer’s journal, had the good fortune to receive from Your Highness at
                    the time. The clarity which lent favour to the aforementioned essay shall not, I flatter myself, be
                    found lacking in the present one, and generally I hope that, in light of current affairs, it may
                    speak a timely word and be of service – and at the very least meet with the approval of those
                    readers among the public whose favour I aspire to earn.
                    <br>
                    <br>Admittedly, without being explicitly named, Denmark is the state upon which I have chiefly
                    directed my attention, yet it is not the only one. I have, towards the end, also given my views on
                    the French assignats, and I treat the matter of paper money as a whole, seeking to reduce the
                    undoubtedly vague and unsettled notions of a large part of the public back to the simple
                    foundational principles – to that which truly lies at the heart of the matter.
                    <br>
                    <br>It may well be that even in this form, my essay will not find favour in Copenhagen; yet it
                    cannot be deemed offensive, and I do not consider myself obliged, merely for fear of possible
                    displeasure, to withhold the delivery of public-spirited, albeit unacknowledged, truths. And should
                    my essay, even in Denmark, contribute in some measure to the recognition of such overlooked yet
                    exceedingly important truths – no less important than what I have formerly preached there with some
                    success regarding the peasantry – then my principal aim would be fulfilled, which ever has been and
                    remains: to be of service to this state.
                    <br>
                    <br>Since the current times demand the prompt publication of this essay, I would gladly send this
                    manuscript to Mr. Schlözer already this coming Saturday. But should its perusal, in the admittedly
                    brief interim, be inconvenient to Your Most Serene Highness, then I can also delay the dispatch by
                    eight days hence; for before all other readers, I wish this essay the good fortune of being read by
                    one who is, in equal measure, both exalted and well-versed – and who, from the outset, may bestow
                    upon it the attention necessary for a thorough perusal to the end.
                    <br>
                    <br>3rd November 1790.
                    <br>Evening, 6 o’clock
                    <br>In deepest humility,
                    <br>GC v. Oeder
