        <h3>§. 145.</h3>
        To clarify the drafts of methods presented in the following three sections, and to explain the principal natural
        classes, it will be most useful to begin with a list of Northern European plants, such as that in Flora Svecica
        by Mr. von Linné. For the sake of brevity, this will include only his generic names, marked with numbers, so
        that each genus can be briefly and conveniently indicated at the place where, according to the rules of each
        method, it properly belongs. The order in which I arrange this list is not a strictly arbitrary method, much
        less do I present it as a coherent natural system; yet it seems to me to group the natural families quite well
        according to their affinities, and to leave them undisturbed. With this, I do not mean to say that I will
        observe this very order in the future list of Danish plants, for in the determination of similarities and in the
        arrangement of plants according to their affinities, there is always something to improve. And in compiling such
        a list, one is obliged to follow the best insights available at the time of writing.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 146.</h3>
        The main sections of the present register, when the order is considered as a mixed method, are as follows:

        <h3> Classess </h3>
        A. Flowerless plants — Cryptantheræ(Plants without visible flowers, e.g. mosses, algae, fungi)
        <br>B. Plants with pointed seeds — Monocotyledones(Monocots: plants with a single seed leaf, e.g. grasses,
        lilies)
        <br>C. Plants with flowers in catkins — Amentaceæ(E.g. birch, hazel, willow)
        <br> D. Inconspicuously flowering plants — Incompletæ(Plants with reduced or incomplete floral structures)
        <br> E. Plants with fruit-bearing calyx — Calycicarpæ(Where the floral covering is fused to or persists around
        the fruit)
        <br> K. Plants with flower-bearing calyx — Calycanthemæ(With prominent, showy calyx structures, e.g. roses)
        <br>G. Plants with single-petaled flowers — Monopetalæ(Corolla formed by one united petal, e.g. bellflowers)
        <br> H. Plants with multi-petaled flowers — Polypetalæ(Flowers with several distinct petals, e.g. buttercups,
        roses)

        <br>The key to this method was evidently created afterward,once the natural classes had already been
        determined,in order to show some connection among them and with the other genera,as far as it could
        reasonably be done.The declared intent of its originator was more to attemptan approximation to the plan
        of naturethan to provide a strictly arbitrary method.For the purpose of guiding beginners, it is truly too
        difficult,as understanding the headings of its divisionsrequires knowledge that one cannot presume in a
        beginner.

        <br>Note.
        <br>
        <br>The arrangement of families in this method was initially established, the key came later, and one cannot
        express it better, or comment on all methods where the primary intent is to preserve the natural families, than
        as the venerable founder himself has stated:
        <br>"I have," he says in Enum, Helv. Pref. 14, "deemed it a duty and intention to place each family between two
        other closely related and difficult to separate families, so that a transition from one to the other might be
        apparent. However, I could not fully achieve this as desired, and this is likely a matter that is scarcely
        possible anywhere, for from each natural family, a transition into many other such families occurs through
        various traits, as much in one as in the other. Nevertheless, I have followed the principle that the herbs must
        be grouped together that are largely similar in most respects, even if they might be quite different in some
        aspects. However, those must remain apart which differ in most aspects, even if there is a great similarity in a
        single feature. By ‘aspects,’ I also consider the overall appearance or demeanor of the plants. Thus, it does
        not concern me if, here and there, in a class, one finds a plant that does not exhibit the characteristic from
        which the name of the class was derived."
        <br>Meanwhile, Mr. von Haller has noted for each class the plants that, due to the title of the class, should be
        included but have been left among their relatives in other classes for better reasons, as well as those that
        were included solely for analogy, not according to the class titles. The former are marked with *; the latter
        with +.

        <br>Notes:
        <br>
        <br>Tournefort first decided to establish classes and genera, and only later thought about the method
        itself.(J.R.H. p. 50). He was guided by previously recognized classes that he intended to keep undisturbed, and
        this led him to the general organizing principles that we now see in his method. The seventh class was
        established before the sixth was conceived. The eighth could have stayed within the sixth if it had not
        naturally formed its own class. The ninth class is natural but does not fit into the method’s planned structure.
        Classes 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, and 13 led him to use the shape of the flower as a distinguishing feature of the
        class. The sections a-d in the fifth class prompted him to add the other sections. The sixth and twenty-first
        classes were influenced by sections ae in the former and section e in the latter.When considered as an arbitrary
        method designed so that an independent beginner might use it, it is not strict enough, and the concepts and
        terms are not defined clearly enough.
        <br>
        <br>Regarding B. This classification was made by Tournefort out of favor for the common terms used in daily
        life.(J.R.H. p. 75).
        <br>
        <br>Regarding AB. Here, there is often uncertainty about the terms Calyx and Corolla.
        <br>
        <br>Regarding Classes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 20, 21. The concepts of flower shapes are too vague.
        <br>
        <br>Execution of this Method:
        <br>
        <br>Preliminary Reminder: The primary basis for the sub-divisions is taken from the connection between the young
        fruit and the other reproductive parts. His expressions are:Pistillum abides in fruit, Calyx abides in fruit,
        and the first occurs when the reproductive organs are connected below, the latter when they are connected at the
        top of the embryo.

        <br>B. With unknown sex. Cryptogamia.
        <br>
        <br>General Remarks.
        <br>
        <br>The entire method is mixed. The classes ZM and YA to XE, eight under twenty-four, do not stem from the
        original structure of the method but owe their existence to various natural classes that are older than the
        method itself and were present in the order of thought, even though they received new names based on a feature
        of the sexual organs.
        <br>
        <br>To AAB. The difference in the length of the threads is one among many differences, and it is not only the
        didynamists and tetradynamists that show this difference; also, the shortness of the two threads is often only
        apparent due to their lower position.
        <br>
        <br>To AAC. This fusion is found in many more plants that are not included in any of the five classes XA to XE,
        and in many, such as the Geraniums in Monadelphia, and in most Polyadelphists, it is imperceptible to a beginner
        who is unfamiliar with these herbs beforehand.
        <br>
        <br>To ZM. The consideration underlying this class is just one among many considerations that the position and
        incorporation of the stamens give rise to.
        <br>
        <br>To AB. The traits taken from the male flower alone are not sufficient to lead to the initial recognition of
        these plants, and a beginner who has an individual femininum without male, or a hermaphroditum individual from
        Polygamia without male or female at hand, will not know where to look in the first case and will search in vain
        in the second case.
        <br>
        <br>In general, many species are not placed where they should be according to the laws of the method, but are
        left with their relatives. This would not matter if only there were a reminder at the place where a beginner
        following the method would search for these species, pointing to the place where they actually are, and this is
        required by the intent of all arbitrary methods.

        <br>Notes.
        <br>
        <br>This designation is really only suitable for the few herbs with flower types that carry stamens. The
        remaining and largest part of the class consists of the Cryptantheræ, and this reminder can be enough for a
        beginner.
        <br>
        <br>To AAB. Here, the fluctuating concepts of calyx and corolla can hinder a beginner.
        <br>
        <br>To AB. Since the male and female flowers of a species are often very dissimilar to one another, it would be
        necessary to arrange such species, especially the Diphytas, not only by one but by both types of flowers.
        <br>
        <br>Otherwise, this method is easy and convenient for a beginner due to the many sub-divisions and the many
        opposing relative terms.
        <br>

        a chain-like connection with one another, just as little as such a linkage is sought in the Linnaean natural
        orders or the Adansonian families. Morison clearly did not intend to create what we now call a "method," but
        rather to identify natural classes without regard to their relationships to each other—naturally, classes that
        were devised and defined with only moderate success based on the still crude and unrefined concepts of the time.

        <br>Note.
        <br>
        <br>Ray was particularly focused on natural classes, and he was quite successful with his method in this regard.
        Not only are the classes with numbers attached completely natural as they are, but even in other classes, which
        are not entirely natural in their entirety, there are still many subdivisions from natural families. He took
        into account the whole growth of the plants when considering their fruitification, and he derived many
        successful natural class names from this, such as:
        <br>Monocotyledons,
        <br>Dicotyledons,
        <br>Compofitæ,
        <br>Umbelliferæ,
        <br>Stellatæ,
        <br>Asperifoliæ,
        <br>Verticillatæ.
        <br>Moreover, it was unnecessary to develop this method, as Boerhaave’s method, with which it was done, is very
        similar to it.

        also categorizes herbs more than any other method and disrupts all relationships.
        <br>
        <br>Bernhard Hinrich Rupp’s method differs from the Rivinus method in that the consideration of regularity and
        irregularity precedes the consideration of individual plants or the combination of several flowers.

        <br>
        <br>This method has not been applied in any catalog, as its author based it on various peculiar and
        contradictory concepts. The essence of the flower, according to him, lies in the petal, which others view only
        as a covering for the more essential parts that define the sex of the flower. He also refers to the petal as
        what others call the calyx. Regarding the fruit, on which he bases his subcategories, he claims that no seed can
        be considered naked, and he includes the naturally attached and inseparable coverings, as well as the skins that
        every seed possesses, in his classification.

        <br>
        <br>Already, Magnol in his book Character plantarum novus proposed a method based on the flower cover, but he
        uses the word calyx in a broader sense, which also includes the fruit case, which he calls the inner calyx. In
        his subcategories, he departs again from the flower cover and classifies based on the flower and fruit.
        Furthermore, this Magnolian method has not been implemented in any catalog, making the design of it unnecessary.

        <br>
        <br>This method is extremely complex, and it would be too extensive to explain all its subdivisions, as
        demonstrated with P, Q, and Y, since the mentioned examples are sufficient to illustrate the overall structure
        and course of the method. It can serve as a model of a strict arbitrary method; however, it can also serve as
        proof of how intolerable the demand would be if every founder of an arbitrary method required that the headings
        or names of their classes be memorized, and how completely unnecessary it is to assign names to the classes of
        such methods.

        <h2>Tenth Section.</h2>

        <h3>§. 165.</h3>
        A part of the organic structure of plants can serve as the foundation for an arbitrary method, and such methods
        can be designed and executed with two primary purposes. First, to see how far the detailed examination of such a
        part might lead, and to discover the characteristics for determining the natural families that nature might have
        placed in such a part. Secondly, to serve as a guide for beginners when examining and deciphering unknown
        plants.
        <br>
        <br>Botanists might assign their students, who are eager to learn, the task of applying such methods in a
        well-equipped garden or plant-rich area. Well-thought-out and diligently executed methods would serve as
        registers over the book of nature, or a part of it, always providing the same benefits as various registers in
        an important and material-rich book. Furthermore, the public would have no reason to complain about costs if
        such methods were not presented as books by their authors, but rather as mere registers of a general catalog of
        the plant kingdom, such as Mr. Linnaeus's Species Plantarum, and organized in the most concise manner possible.
        <br>
        <br>It would especially be desirable that, with the prejudice set aside that only the reproductive organs could
        and must serve as the foundation of methods, attempts be made with the different parts of the so-called
        appearance (habit), as these would certainly provide more useful insights for determining the true natural
        relationships between plants than is commonly believed. An attempt with the leaves is outlined here, but several
        more could be made with the inflorescence, the stem, and the substance and tissue of plant bodies. However,
        carrying out and comparing the plants with the plan of such a method requires much time, and no groundwork has
        yet been done.
        <br>
        <br>When devising arbitrary methods for the use of beginners, one must consider their perspective to ensure
        comfort, and judge how much can reasonably be assumed, and how the parts that are suggested for their
        examination are typically present together or follow each other.
        <br>
        <br>The foundations of all methods can also, to some extent, be combined into a general rule without being
        executed separately in the usual way through continued subdivisions, as §. 93 contains, where one who sets out
        to study a plant is guided through all considerations of the plants in question.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 166.</h3>
        <h3>Method Based on the Flower Covers</h3>
        A. Flowers without any covering.
        <br>B. Flowers with covering.
        <br>BA. Many flowers connected together.
        <br>BB. Individual flowers without connection.
        <br>X. BAA. In a catkin.
        <br>U. BAB. Under small scales: Grass species.
        <br>T. BAC. In a flower sheath.
        <br>S. BAD. With a covering around the flower.
        <br>R. BAE. In an umbel.
        <br>Q. BAF. Within a common flower cover.
        <br>P. BBA. With an incomplete flower, namely a flower without a cover, or a flower that resembles a flower
        cover.
        <br>O. BBB. With a flower and flower cover, but the cover falls off easily.
        <br>Z. BBC. With a flower and flower cover that can be found together.
        <br>ZA. Flower on the fruit.
        <br>ZB. Flower out of the cover.
        <br>ZC. Flower around the fruit.
        <br>ZCA. Double flower cover.
        <br>Y. ZCB. Simple flower cover.
        <br>YA. Regular, with parts that are similarly shaped.
        <br>YB. Irregular, with parts that are dissimilar.
        <br>
        <br>Note
        <br>
        <br>For BB and U: All grass species must be searched under BAB, including those that only have one flower in the
        spike, and would otherwise be categorized under BB.
        <br>
        <br>For BA and X through Q: There are more ways to connect multiple fructifications, and one could generally
        establish a method based solely on the flower structure and the way the plant blooms. However, it has been
        decided for now to limit this to these six types, and the other plants, whose flowers are connected in a way
        different from these six, must be searched under BB.

        <h3>§. 170.</h3>

        <h3>Method for Plants with Flowers, Based on the Connection of the Fructification Parts to One Another
        </h3>
        A. Free fruit, which is in no way connected with the floral envelopes, but has its base independently at the tip
        of the stalk.
        <br>B. Semi-free fruit, such that it is doubtful whether the fruit arises solely from the tip of the stalk or
        also from the flower.
        <br>C. Adnate fruit, or fruit from the floral envelope, which is connected and fused with the ovary, so that the
        flower appears to sit on the fruit.
        <br>
        <br>AA. With stamens entirely emerging from the base of the fruit
        <br>AB. With stamens partly from the fruit base, partly from the flower
        <br>AC. With stamens from a single-petaled flower
        <br>AD. With stamens and flower both arising from the floral envelope
        <br>
        <br>BA. With stamens from a simple flower
        <br>BB. With stamens from a flower-bearing calyx
        <br>
        <br>CA. With individual ovaries, each on its own fruit base, without connection to others
        <br>CB. With united ovaries from a shared base
        <br>
        <br>Note
        <br>
        <br>The ovary is the part and place of the plant where its seed is attached, grows, and ripens—whether this part
        is enclosed in a covering or shell, or left bare.
        <br>Of all the bases for arbitrary methods following the structure of the fruit organs, the observation of the
        position and connection of the fruiting organs seems the most natural and best at keeping the families of herbs
        together. It is rightly to Cesalpino’s credit that, as the inventor of the first botanical method, he began with
        such a fortunate idea.
        <br>The superiority of this basis becomes clear when we consider what happens inside a plant as it prepares for
        fructification: the entire organic body unfolds in its usual natural layers, and these layers make space for
        each other so that each can develop into a distinct major part of the fructification. Thus, in the various
        modifications they take on, the internal connection that they retain among one another remains the most
        important, preserving many traces of the original inner essential structure.

        <h3>§. 172.</h3>
        <h3>Eleventh Section
        </h3>
        This eleventh section is intended as commentary on the classification presented in § 146, and as an aid in
        explaining the characters of the natural classes and families contained therein. It is hoped that the method of
        using the letters of the alphabet to indicate the divisions, the derivation of the lower from the higher, and
        their relationships to each other, will meet with approval, as it is more convenient than the usual
        genealogical-tree-like form.
        <br>
        <br>Among the eight principal classes indicated, the following oppositions are found:
        <br>A against B–H
        <br>B against C–H
        <br>C-D against E–H
        <br>E against F–H
        <br>F against G–H
        <br>G against H
        <br>Anyone who wishes to chart the family tree in the usual manner should take note of these oppositions.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 173.</h3>
        <h3>Class A.</h3>
        The various modes of generation and propagation of the plants belonging to this class are still shrouded in much
        obscurity and subject to many doubts; whereas in the other classes B–H, the mode of propagation, and especially
        the mutual relation of stamens and pistils as true sexual organs, is hardly a matter of dispute. And as long as
        the supposed analogy with the arrangements common in the rest of the plant kingdom has not been clearly
        demonstrated in 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, AC, and AD, it is better to consider that which is so doubtful as not existing
        at all.
        <br>
        <br>Due to this obscurity and the great diversity among these plants, the concept of this class can only be
        expressed in negative terms, namely: in many, no trace of fructification is found at all, and in those where
        something is visible, it bears no clear resemblance to what is usually called a flower (§ 53). In most, one or
        more of the main structural parts—root, stem, leaf, fructification—are either completely absent or not
        distinguishable as separate parts, but rather fused together. In general, the overall habit and form of a plant,
        as we are accustomed to in the plant kingdom, is missing.
        <br>
        <br>Naturally, a class for which no other than negative definitions can be given can hardly be called a proper
        class, and therefore we will not present this one in its parts as a class in the usual sense, though taken
        collectively, it contains very natural families, and their common difference from the rest of the plant kingdom
        justifies this treatment.
        <br>
        <br>Beginners in botany should not concern themselves with this class until they have acquired a fair knowledge
        of the other parts of the plant kingdom, since one must rely on the concepts of usual plant structure as a
        foundation, and through comparison with that, arrive at an understanding of the actual structure of these
        flowerless plants.
        <br>
        <br>Another major difficulty in this class—not only for beginners, but even for botanists themselves—arises from
        the difficulty in determining what is a species or a variety. This is due, among other things, to our limited
        knowledge of their modes of propagation and even less control over their reproduction, unlike in the other
        classes, where generation can often be experimentally managed at will.

        <h3>§. 174.</h3>
        AA. 1, 2, 3 consist of:
        <br>1 and 2 — only of threads
        <br>3 — of a cellular tissue
        <br>
        <br>AA. 4, 5, 6 consist of a membranous, leaf-like, or gelatinous dense non-cellular substance:
        <br>4. Fine membranous skin without a stem, flat or enclosing a hollow space, without fructification.
        <br>5. Leathery skin with an internally running stem (excluding tree-like forms), usually bifurcated, with
        bladders or nodes, typically at the ends of the branches, where a kind of fructification appears.
        <br>6. Gelatinous substance without fructification; the leaf-like types approach 14 and 16.
        <br>
        <br>AA. 7 Crust-like, homogeneous, mealy substance of various forms—thread-like, bushy, cup-shaped,
        leaf-shaped—generally show a kind of fructification consisting of an outgrowth (mostly shield-shaped), sprouting
        at the edge or ends, differing in color and substance from the rest of the plant.
        <br>
        <br>AA. 8–11 Already exhibit more of the usual plant-like appearance in color and substance, and also a more
        distinctly organized fructification. They resemble leaves but lack a true root or stem.
        <br>9 and 10 — Have a fructification raised above the plant on a separate stalk and already show a difference in
        sex, although what is regarded as the female part may in fact merely be an outgrowth of germs.
        <br>11 Approaches AC.

        <h3>§. 175.</h3>
        AB. Fungi (Sponges)
        <br>
        <br>They have a fleshy, mostly soft, juicy, and quickly perishable substance, or, when dry and more
        long-lasting, a cork-like texture. Their bodies are compact, without branches (except in 15), without leaves,
        and nearly without roots. They bear and reproduce from seeds, which, however, are invisible to the naked eye and
        inconvenient as a basis for historical knowledge.
        <br>
        <br>12–15. Have a simple body that is not divided into parts in any definite manner.
        <br>16–21. Have two main parts: a stem and a cap—although in some species that grow laterally out of trees, the
        stem is missing.
        <br>12. 13. Have their seeds inside their bodies, which are surrounded by a skin:
        <br>in 12, the inner substance is pulpy (mash-like),
        <br>in 13, it is fleshy.
        <br>Some species of 12 have a stem.
        <br>14. A somewhat indeterminate genus. Peziza lentifera bears a strong resemblance to the cup of liverworts.
        <br>15. Has its seeds in small bladders beneath a surface that appears smooth, although some threads break
        through this surface from the bladders.
        <br>16. Has an irregularly upturned cap made of leathery pieces or lobes, with a smooth surface on both sides.
        The cap is usually a single piece and hollow inside.
        <br>17. 18.
        <br>17: Has a club-shaped cap entirely made of latticework.
        <br>18: Has only a net-like covering over the cap.
        <br>19. 20. Have more or less spread-out caps in a horizontal position, convex on top, flat underneath.
        <br>19 (Tooth fungi): Underside of the cap is covered with spines.
        <br>20 (Tube or pore fungi): Underside has countless small, tightly packed open tubes.
        <br>21. (Gilled fungi): Underside is covered with vertical lamellae or gills, arranged radially from the edge
        toward the center.
        <br>21. To study this genus of gilled fungi, which is overrun with species and even more with varieties, the
        following instructions may be helpful:
        <br>
        <br>Substance of the Cap:
        <br>Call it fleshy if the cap's interior (flesh beneath the skin) is roughly equal in thickness to the gills.
        <br>Membranous if the gills are covered only with the bare skin or nearly so.
        <br>Note also whether the stem is hollow or solid, and whether the whole fungus gives off juice or milk, or is
        dry, splitting into fibers, felt-like, or corky.
        <br>
        <br>Skin of Cap and Stem:
        <br>Observe whether the surface is smooth, shiny, mealy, flaky, sticky, striated, transparent, etc.
        <br>
        <br>Regularity of the Gills:
        <br>Note whether the gills are equal or unequal—some do not reach the center but end between it and the edge.
        <br>
        <br>Distance and Density of Gills:
        <br>Dense and numerous if you cannot see the bottom of the cap between them.
        <br>Sparse and distant if the gaps are wide enough that the base is clearly visible.
        <br>
        <br>Stem Length Compared to Cap Diameter:
        <br>Short: Does not exceed half the cap's diameter.
        <br>Medium: Does not exceed the whole diameter by much.
        <br>Very long: Several times longer than half the cap’s diameter.
        <br>
        <br>Stem Thickness Compared to Cap Flesh Thickness:
        <br>Compare to see if it's proportionally thick or thin.
        <br>
        <br>Attachment of Gills to Stem:
        <br>Usually, the gills end near the central point in a circle around the stem without connecting to it.
        <br>Sometimes the gills run onto the stem and disappear into it.
        <br>
        <br>Gills Degenerating into Folds:
        <br>Sometimes the structures aren’t true lamellae, but irregular folds that lack clear linear direction and may
        merge or form networks (anastomose).
        <br>
        <br>Shape of the Cap:
        <br>Conical, hemispherical, flat, or bowl-shaped indentations do not provide reliable traits, as these forms
        change with age.
        <br>
        <br>Volva and Ring:
        <br>These structures are not good distinguishing features of species, as they are temporary and do not last as
        long as the whole fungus.
        <br>
        <br>Color:
        <br>Colors fade and vary, so they are poor identifiers, except possibly when two distinctly different colors
        appear on different parts of the same fungus.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 176.</h3>
        AC. The mosses have roots, stems, and leaves; the stem is mostly branched, covered all over with persistent
        leaves, and the entire plant remains green, even regaining this appearance after drying out. The leaves are
        attached to the stem without a stalk, positioned in no specific, recognizable pattern from one side to the
        other, and are variously shaped, but mostly pointed at the front end. In some species of genus 31, leaves of
        different characteristics can be found on the same stem. In genus 22, they seem to be absent, but under a
        magnifying glass, they appear at the bulbous node from which the entire stem consists, in the form of small
        scales. In some mosses, especially those growing in moist locations, in addition to the leaves, there is a more
        or less dense wool on the stem, the hairs from which this wool is made seem to be a type of root fibers. In
        genus 22, the stem is covered with raised points resembling warts.
        <br>
        <br>The fruiting bodies (Fructification) are not uniform across the whole class. The usual form, found in
        species 23-26 and 28-30, is as follows: from the end of the stem or branches, a capsule emerges without a stalk
        or on a stalk, with a firmly attached, more or less beak-shaped lid, and is covered in most cases by a small cap
        (Hütgen). The capsule is filled with a green paste, which turns into a fine brown powder. It forms beneath the
        cap and is initially completely covered by it; as it grows, the cap is pushed off and splits. When the powder
        ripens, the lid and cap fall off, and then fine hairs, like those on eyelids, usually appear at the opening of
        the capsule, pointing from the edge towards the center.
        <br>
        <br>The leaf-covered base of the stem in genus 23 can rightly be considered the beginning of a branch. The cap
        is the outer covering of the entire fruiting body that forms beneath it, much like a young sponge within its
        egg-shaped shell, and may be considered an essential part, which seems to be absent in genus 30, because it
        falls off early due to the spherical shape of the capsule, and one generally arrives too late to observe it. In
        most species of genus 26, a double capsule is visible, one inside the other, with the inner dark capsule filled
        with powder or dust appearing to protrude through the outer one, leaving a space between the two. This is a
        feature observable in most mosses. In genus 22, a similar arrangement appears, as well as in species of genus
        27, in the vascular stem, along with a similar stalk, as will be reported next in Polytrichum: the bladder
        beneath the capsule arises from an enlargement of the stem. Perhaps all mosses have a double capsule, but in
        most cases, the two layers are fused, and only in some species does the outer layer separate, swell, and blister
        in different ways. Perhaps a separate section could be created for mosses that bear such a form of capsule
        enclosed within a bladder (capsula tunicata), and the genera 22, 26, and 27 would fall into this category. It
        might also be worth noting that in Polytrichum commune, a stalk running through the capsule like a column is
        visible, which is actually a continuation of the stem of the capsule, and when the attached powder is removed,
        it is covered with fine threads resembling hairs, much like the column in a fruit capsule (columella capfulae)
        of flowering plants. I have observed such a stalk in the capsules of several mosses.
        <br>
        <br>Regarding the usual fruiting body described earlier, according to the above-mentioned notes, genera 22 and
        27 do not fundamentally differ, but in genus 31, a great variety is seen. Here, no capsule with its accessories
        is found, but instead, anthers consisting of two lobes without a stalk, located in the angles between the leaf
        and the stem, one in each angle, or beneath leaf-like scales that overlap like roof tiles in a gable.
        <br>
        <br>One of the European species, Lycopodium Selaginoides (Flora Danica, f. 70), in addition to these typical
        anthers, which it shares with its relatives and carries beneath the leaves closer to the end of the branch, also
        has another type of fruiting body beneath the leaves located lower on the stem, consisting of four paired
        spherical capsules, each with a transverse slit, somewhat like the seeds in genus 36. The moss depicted in Flora
        Danica, f. 215, may initially be classified in genus 31, but it is in itself a peculiar plant.
        <br>
        <br>In some mosses, there is also an irregularly called "fructification," namely a leaf-like sprouting at the
        tip of the stem in the shape of a star, or along its sides, or also at the tip of the stalk where a capsule
        would normally emerge. However, this so-called fructification can hardly be seen as anything other than a type
        of sprouting, similar to what is observed in flowering plants in the plant kingdom, where either new shoots
        emerge alongside the regular fructification, which either fall off or remain attached to the mother plant, or
        the seed still grows and develops on the plant. This is why sections 48 and 91 are recalled. The number of
        mosses that exhibit such sprouting is far too small compared to the total number of mosses to consider it a
        typical and characteristic mode of reproduction for the entire class, and one would still be justified in
        assuming that such sprouts are present in all mosses, even where not the slightest trace of them is visible. The
        presence of a great number of small plants adhering to the mosses further compels the belief in the existence of
        a fine and abundant seed, which is most naturally sought within the capsules.
        <br>
        <br>The aforementioned Lycopodium Selaginoides particularly confirms the hypothesis that the usual reproductive
        system of the plant kingdom, involving the interaction of two sexual parts, also applies to this class. However,
        it is still an unclear question as to what the parts of each sex might be. Perhaps they are located closer
        together than one might believe, and united in a single capsule with its accessories, like in the capsules of
        Pilularia, and perhaps mosses, like flowering plants, are hermaphroditic, with the exception of some species? If
        one accepts the previously indicated irregular fructification in mosses as nothing more than sprouts, not as a
        feature of the female sex, in contrast to the capsules with their accessories, which represent the male sex and
        should be nothing more than what the pollen threads and bags are in other plants, then the section of the class
        containing mosses with separate sexes would no longer exist, and genus 25 would have to be absorbed, with its
        species distributed among genera 23 and 24, as is done for other plants where such sprouting is typical, e.g.,
        certain grass species or species from genera 122, 223, and 376, for which no separate genus is created.
        Additionally, for many species previously classified under genus 25, where the supposed male and female plants
        are often not found together, one might be confused if only a male plant is available, as there would be no
        clear way to tell if it belongs to genera 23, 24, or genus 25.
        <br>
        <br>Furthermore, the specific characteristics of the Linnaean genera 22-31 can be found in their respective
        places on page 153.

        <h3>§. 177.</h3>
        AD. 35-40. Ferns. They have roots and leaves but no stem. The root is strong and woody. The leaves are, for the
        most part, highly divided, and before they break out, they are spirally rolled inward. They have a notably long
        petiole, which is usually triangular and has a groove on its inner side, and is typically covered with a sticky
        substance, especially in young plants. The leaf with its petiole takes the place of the stem; from the petiole
        and its veins, the fruiting bodies emerge, and some species of genus 36 prove that the stems found in other
        species of the same genus and in genus 35, dedicated to the fruiting bodies, are actually petioles, which are
        only partially or not at all covered with leaves. In genera 37-40, all leaves, without exception, bear fruiting
        bodies.
        <br>
        <br>The fruiting bodies are not entirely the same. In genera 37-40, they form on the underside of the leaves and
        consist of a powder, which is arranged in round clusters or in lines in different directions, or may cover the
        entire surface of the leaf, and is partially covered by the raised epidermis in some species. Under a magnifying
        glass, this powder appears as round grains, which contain many smaller grains within a thin shell. In some
        species, each such grain is wrapped with a ring in its center, which resembles a string of beads. In genus 36,
        the naked eye can clearly see each individual grain with a transverse slit, which opens when the grain ripens.
        In genus 35, the fruiting bodies lie flattened with a transverse slit, in two rows tightly packed together, and
        without separating from one another.
        <br>
        <br>The whole fruiting body is still shrouded in much uncertainty. It is highly probable that the powder
        contained in the aforementioned grains and capsules is the seed, but whether there is also a difference in
        gender in this class, and whether something similar to stamens and pollen tubes exists, is still not clearly
        established. For instance, in the aforementioned species, where the grain is surrounded by the bead-like ring,
        the beads could represent the place of the anthers, with the seed contained in the grain itself, and
        fertilization would occur when the shell of the grain or capsule breaks? And in the other cases, where no such
        ring is present, the fertilizing pollen could lie next to the seed in the same capsule?
        <br>
        <br>Genera 32-34 have been added alongside ferns following the example of other herb experts, though without
        claiming that they form a natural class with the ferns.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 34 shows very little resemblance to ferns and is added by some modern botanists to the genera found in
        CA. If its visible fruiting body is only the male part, the female part must be sought, though no trace of it
        has been found so far.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 32 and 33 are closely related to one another.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 33 resembles ferns in that its leaves are initially spirally rolled. It is likely that the powder in
        which the seed grains lie in the capsules represents the place of the anthers, and this raises the possibility
        that, in many flowerless plants, both sex organs are closer together than one might think.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 178.</h3>
        B. The name of this section is derived from a circumstance that, at the time when people sought to learn about
        plants, it was usually not possible to inquire about. Nonetheless, the parallel-fibered tissue of the plants
        belonging to this section is at all times a sufficient characteristic of these spiky-seeding plants, which
        undoubtedly make up a natural main section of the plant kingdom.
        <br>
        <br>The seed’s core does not split into two or more pieces, as in plants from the other sections C-H, where
        these pieces grow into distinct seed leaves, with the plant developing between them. Instead, these
        spiky-seeding plants only grow with one leaf, which appears just as the following leaves do.
        <br>
        <br>The stem mostly emerges from one or more sheaths between the leaves, so that the leaves seem to peel off
        from the stem and develop from it. Therefore, the leaves are usually solitary, and several from a single point
        on the stem are extremely rare. They do not have actual petioles but only a narrowed base. The stem also does
        not have a firm, dense body and no type of growth above the root, unlike all the genera 51-95.
        <br>
        <br>The main characteristic of the entire class, as already mentioned, is the tissue of these plants, especially
        their leaves, which consist of parallel fibers that do not, like the veins and nerves in the other sections C-H,
        branch out and form a net-like structure.
        <br>
        <br>In the parts of the fruiting body, the number three predominates, and exceptions are rare.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 179.</h3>
        BA. Grass. The roots are not all the same, but in many cases, like the stem, they are jointed, creeping, and
        send out roots from the joints. The stalk is round, made up of hollow joints with visible nodal points, and at
        each joint, its direction changes slightly, so that, with the lower joints being shorter and closer to the root,
        they deviate from the vertical direction and approach the ground. From these lowest nodes, roots and new shoots
        emerge, allowing for tillering or branching; for the parts farther from the earth, each stalk is usually simple,
        and the branches, which appear in some species, do not reach the stage of fruiting. The stalk breaks through a
        cluster of root-leaves, lifting some leaves, roughly one per joint, upwards. These leaves standing on the stalk
        consist of two parts: a tubular sheath, closed or slit, around the stalk, and the actual leaf, which projects
        from the stalk. Between the two, at the mouth of the tube, there is a bract or ligule made of a fine white
        membrane, or sometimes, though rarely, just hairs. The leaf is typically a narrow, flat blade, pointed at the
        tip, but the end is usually not flat, rather it is spoon-shaped. The underside is smooth, while the upper side
        is more or less deeply striated. Sometimes the leaf is not flat like a blade but shaped like a tongue.
        <br>
        <br>The upper part of the stalk bears the fruiting bodies and is usually hidden in a sheath or spathe made by
        the top leaf when the fruiting bodies are still incomplete. The fruiting bodies sit either stalkless in a spike
        around the upper part of the stalk, or the stalk branches into smaller stems, and the fruiting bodies then form
        in a panicle, each on its own little stalk.
        <br>
        <br>The flower consists of a bare seed with two pollen tubes and three long filaments, also with long anthers,
        both enclosed between two small bracts, which open during flowering, allowing the pollen tubes and filaments to
        reach the open air. Afterwards, they close around the seed and often cannot be separated again. Such a flower,
        or several of them together, has a floral cover at its base made of other mostly similar bracts, and together
        this forms a small spikelet. (See §. 73.) The flowers are generally hermaphroditic, but in some species, an
        incomplete flower from the female part may occasionally appear. Additionally, some genera have other parts of
        the flower.
        <br>
        <br>Beginners are usually daunted by this class, and botanists can attest that almost no other class has a more
        troublesome and unpleasant comparison of synonyms, because so little decisive information is found in the
        literature. However, this is not the fault of nature, as it has introduced enough diversity into the structure
        of grasses, but rather the fault of botanists, with a few exceptions, who typically provide superficial
        descriptions and neglect the finer details that would make a difference, or they repeat the common
        characteristics of the whole class for each species, while the specific features that should distinguish the
        species are drowned in trivial details.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 41-44 have their flowers in spikes, while the following ones have them in panicles. Genera 45 and 46,
        in part, also have a form of one-sided spike.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 47-53 have notably large floral covers in which the flowers (in most genera, individual flowers) are
        enclosed.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 54-58 have small, mostly pointed individual flowers (except for some in genus 54) in a small cover,
        with genus 55 having no cover.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 59-63 have spikelets made up of several flowers with notably broad bracts.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 180.</h3>
        BB. Have a mostly triangular stem without joints. The leaves are not flat, but in some cases, round or
        spoon-shaped, triangular. Flowers in catkins, mostly with separate sexes. Also, three filaments, like the true
        grasses. A seed with one pollen tube and mostly a three-lobed stigma. The seed is usually enclosed.
        <br>
        <br> Genus 69 connects this section with genera 79 and 80.
        <br>
        <br> BC. Flowers are flower-like. Six filaments. Seeds in capsules.
        <br>
        <br> Genus 72 has no true flower, or as is commonly thought, three flower petals, three bracts of the flower
        cover; rather, these are undifferentiated six small bracts that are arranged in two layers, and each bract has a
        stamen underneath it. This genus is close to BE, and may possibly have unknown sub-genera in nature.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 181.</h3>
        BD. Includes two families: one (genera 73-75) with many fruits from a single flower, and the other (genera 76,
        77) with a capsule containing many chambers. Overall, they differ from BF, partly due to their unique flower
        covering. Genera 76 and 77 have individual flowers on stems originating from the root, with a flower covering.
        In genera 74, 76, and 77, there is a separation of the sexes.
        <br>
        <br>BE. Includes three families, characterized by flowers on a flower stem that are often clustered tightly
        together. In genera 78, 81, and 82, the stem emerges from a flower sheath, while in genera 79 and 80, the usual
        leaves take their place. In genera 78, 79, 81, and 82, the individual flowers lack distinct coverings and
        intermingle in their crowded arrangement, making it difficult to clearly identify each individual fruiting.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 78 is similar to BA. 41-44. It also has joints. The flower stem resembles a spike emerging from the
        sheath, with a pair of stamens for each seed, showing, despite the lack of a unique covering, enough similarity
        to BA.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 79 and 80 are closer to BB, and genus 69 forms the connection.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 81 and 82 seem to have some relation to genera 72 and 121.
        <br>
        <br>Most plants belonging to BD and BE are aquatic plants, with a characteristic spongy tissue, including small
        cross walls that allow light to pass through, dividing the entire substance into cells.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 182.</h3>
        BF. Partially have a bulb or tuberous root, but generally have a strong, more or less fleshy root, and a
        typically noticeable flower with two sets of three leaves, or six leaves in two different layers, three or six
        stamens, usually a three-lobed stigma, and generally a three-lobed fruit.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 83 forms its own family and is distinguished by the sword-shaped overlapping leaves, which do not face
        the surface but rather the sheath toward the stem, and by the flower on the fruit.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 64-86 have a six-petaled, more or less bell-shaped flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 87 and 88 have a six-petaled, radial flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 89 has many clustered flowers from a flower covering.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 90 has a single-petaled flower. In one species of this genus, the flower is divided into four parts
        with four stamens, completely contrary to the usual character of the class.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 183.</h3>
        BG. Overall, they have a tuberous root, consisting of mostly paired or elongated, split, or bunch-like tubers;
        leaves, each surrounding the stem with a sheath; flowers on the fruit in a spike, each with its own flower
        bract. The fruit is coiled and often contains fine seeds that are attached to the three segments of the fruit.
        In the flower and on the fruit, instead of a pollen tube, there is a callous body, which simultaneously carries
        a pair of stamens on almost imperceptible threads. On both sides of this body, two identical flower petals stand
        upright, and from their base extends an irregular, variously shaped flower petal that is hollowed out into a
        blunt cavity or sac, or into a sharp spur, with a horizontally extended lip, so that the cavity between the
        callous body and the lip opens. Surrounding these parts of the flower is a flower covering made of three
        identical petals, some of which are counted as part of the flower because they are also colored. See §. 64.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 184.</h3>
        C. Have their flowers carried under scales in catkins, or otherwise in this form, either partly or entirely
        separated by sex, except for genus 105.
        <br>
        <br> CA. These are trees and shrubs with narrow, solid or fibrous, evergreen leaves. The male flowers are
        separated in genus 96, and completely separated in genera 97 and 98. The fruit is a cone in genus 96, and a
        berry in genera 97 and 98.
        <br>
        <br> Genus 99 seems to be most similar to genus 98 in the stem, leaves, and the triadic arrangement of fruiting
        organs, and is best placed in this section; it also bears its new shoots like genus 96, emerging from the tips
        of older ones.
        <br>
        <br> CB. Genera 100-108 are trees.
        <br>
        <br> Genera 100 and 101 have female flowers resembling the male ones in catkins, with two-chambered capsules
        filled with many fine, hairy seeds.
        <br>
        <br> Genera 102-104. The female fruiting organs are entirely different from the male ones, and are found in an
        opening bud. The fruit is a type of nut.
        <br>
        <br> Genera 105-108. The female catkins resemble the male ones. Genus 105 has hermaphroditic flowers. The fruit
        is a hard-shelled seed.
        <br>
        <br> Genus 108 can be distinguished by a line from genus 107, and has closer relatives among non-native plants.
        <br>
        <br> Genus 109 has closer relatives not found in our area, and shows some floral similarities with certain
        genera in plants with compound flowers.
        <br>
        <br> Genera 110 and 111 have a single seed. They are related to section 124-129 through genus 124 but are also
        linked by their leaves and other characteristics to genera 105-107.
        <br>
        <br> In this entire section C, there are more features of similarity in overall growth, particularly in the
        leaves, than in the fruiting organs. This has already been shown for CA. In CB, it can be further developed. The
        leaves have petioles; persistent or falling ears; are usually arranged from one side to the other, with few
        exceptions; lie in many cases in the same plane as the stem, most evident in young shoots; in many species, one
        half of the leaf extends longer down the petiole than the other; in genera 102-107, 110, 111, the leaves are
        folded, with rough spots, hairs, or glands scattered over them, and so on.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 185.</h3>
        D. Overall, they have incomplete flowers, which mostly lack the strikingly beautiful appearance typical of
        flowers. These flowers are partly naked or not covered by a flower bract, or the flower is simple, consisting
        only of the flower itself without a bract. Meanwhile, this class is not considered entirely natural, and it has
        been named based on a generally occurring feature, although some genera with incomplete flowers, for better
        reasons, are better placed elsewhere, especially those from DC, where they may find better locations.
        <br>
        <br>DA. Carry their flowers in the angles of the leaves or partly surrounded by floral coverings. All are
        aquatic plants, and genus 118 at least is a coastal plant.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 112-116. Have flowers without distinct coverings or a bract, except possibly genus 114.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 117 and 118 have their flowers embedded in the substance of the leaves.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 119-121. Have a type of flower arranged in whorls on the stem, with genus 121 having them clustered
        in a spike.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 112-116. Due to the lack of distinct coverings, the apparent separation of the sexes in some species
        of these genera should hardly be regarded as a true separation.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 112 is too closely related to genus 113 to be classified with the Algis.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 115 and 116 seem to form almost a single genus.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 121 shows some relationship to genera 81 and 82.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 186.</h3>
        DB. The name is derived from the flower arrangement, as in most species, the flowers are frequently and densely
        grouped in clusters or clumps in the angles of the leaves or on separate stems. They have a single seed (except
        genus 129), either naked or surrounded by a fine shell. In many species, there is a separation of the sexes.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 122 and 123. The leaves form a sheath around the stem, giving it the appearance of joints. Each
        stalk, including the main stem and its branches, is particularly encased at the base with a skin or sheath. The
        fruit is a naked triangular seed.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 124 is closely related to genus 110.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 125-129. Have a flattened, round seed, which in genera 127 and 129 is surrounded by a capsule.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 130 has not yet been clearly placed.
        <br>
        <br>DC. This entire section is not natural but merely arbitrary, and the genera included here require comparison
        with many plants not found in our area, as well as with many species that likely exist in nature but are yet to
        be discovered. They generally have seed cases or berries.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 187.</h3>
        E. in comparison with F and G. H. In G. and H. the ovary occupies the central point of the fruiting body, with
        the flower surrounding it, the flower-cover surrounding the flower, and it is completely separated from both as
        a distinct part. These three main parts of the fruiting body have their own concentric positions.
        <br>
        <br>In F. the always multi-leafed flower and the stamens have their place and position in and on the
        flower-cover, which, although it protrudes from the ovary at its upper part, is more or less clearly connected
        to it at the bottom, and forms the base of the fruit.
        <br>
        <br>In G. the ovary is fully incorporated into the flower-cover, and this is inseparably attached around it, so
        that often only a small edge of the flower-cover protrudes over the fruit. The flower with the stamens therefore
        finds its place on the fruit.
        <br>
        <br>EA-EE. The plants in these five divisions bear connected fruiting bodies, either under a common cover on a
        fruit base spread over an inseparable surface, without distinct stems, or on distinct stems that are variously
        connected in a main stem. Generally, the fruiting bodies grow from the ends of the branches, and where they seem
        to stand (in a few cases) in the angles of the leaves, one might reasonably regard this as the beginning of a
        branching shoot.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 188.</h3>
        EA. Plants with compound flowers. See §§ 66-71. Among all native plants, there is not a single tree or shrub,
        but the stem is weak, hollow inside or filled with pith, and the structure of wooden fibers is separated by much
        parenchyma. The leaves stand from one side to the other, except for genera 178 and 179, which are entirely
        without stems. The individual fruiting bodies are all grouped closely together without distinct stems, on a base
        that is bordered with small leaves which overlap the fruiting bodies like an actual flower-cover over their
        bloom. The fruit base is actually the expanded tip of the stem, the stem of a compound flower is a branch, and
        the leaves that make up the cover of the compound flower are the leaves of the branch, only differing from the
        other leaves of the stem, and sometimes only in size.
        <br>
        <br>The base is covered with small depressions, in which the fruiting bodies are embedded, and between the
        depressions, it is often covered with hairs and leaves.
        <br>
        <br>The flower-cover shows endless variations in the form of the leaves, their state, and their arrangement with
        each other. Three main types should be noted: a flower-cover with a simple layer of parallel leaves or scales, a
        flower-cover with many scales lying like roof tiles, and a cover with a base that consists of two segments.
        <br>
        <br>The fruit is a seed with an attached flower-cover, which sometimes protrudes over the seed and crowns it
        with a rim, but more often lies flat against the seed and is barely noticeable, so that in these flowers, no
        distinct flower-cover seems to be present. This seed can, after reaching maturity, be covered with a crown of
        leaves or tips, or a crown of hairs, and this hair-crown consists of simple or feathered hairs, which can also
        sometimes rise on a separate stem sitting on the seed.
        <br>
        <br>On the fruit sits the flower, which is generally single-leaved and has a tube, but is otherwise variously
        shaped at the opening, namely with a regular bell- or star-shaped throat and mouth, or with a deeply dissected
        irregular round-bent throat and mouth, and a long, also irregularly curved tube, or with a flat,
        outward-pointing tail at the end of the compound flower.
        <br>
        <br>These different flowers are in different connections, collected on the same fruit base within the common
        cover, and form four main forms of a compound flower, depending on whether they consist of only twisted, only
        long-tubular, only regular tubular, or fourthly, a combination of twisted and regular tubular flowers
        simultaneously, with those in the middle, and others around the edge.
        <br>
        <br>Also regarding the sexual parts, the individual flowers are different, and among them are hermaphrodites,
        infertile hermaphrodites, female, and sexless flowers. The twisted flowers in the starry flowers are always
        female.
        <br>
        <br>The stamens are five in number, embedded in the tube of the flower, but their anthers are fused into a tube
        through which the pollen pathway runs and protrudes at the top with its two-lobed stigma.
        <br>
        <br>EA 138-150. These have flowers composed entirely of twisted hermaphrodite flowers. They generally give milk.
        <br>
        <br>EA 151-157. These have bulbous flowers composed of irregular long-tubular flowers. Genus 157. has sexless
        flowers on the edge, also different in shape from the others. All the prominent points on the edges of their
        leaves, as well as the leaves or scales of the flower-cover, have a more or less stiff and pointed tip.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 158-161. Have flat flowers made up of regular flowers, except for genus 158.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 165-175. Have star-shaped flowers made up of regular flowers in the center and twisted flowers at the
        edge, but in a few species of genus 171, the twisted flowers are absent.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 176-179. Have leaves on the fruit base between the flowers.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 189.</h3>
        EB. These plants have opposite leaves, free-standing stamens that are not connected to the anthers, and a seed
        clearly enclosed and bordered by its own flower-cover. Despite many similarities, the genera included in this
        section also differ considerably from each other and combine several classes, particularly genus 184, which
        connects the divisions EA and EC, as well as the genera in the EE division, which do the same on their side.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 180, 181, 182 (partly), and 184 have a common flower-cover, as in EA. Genus 183 and mostly genus 182
        carry their fruiting bodies on distinct stems, which come from a stem or branch that entirely dissolves into
        stems, with a small leaf at each fruiting body.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 180, 181, 183, and 184 have single-leaved flowers, which in 180, 181, resemble the irregular tubular
        flowers of EA, but without such long tubes. Genus 182 has a five-petaled flower.
        <br>
        <br>The number of stamens varies; 180, 181, and 184 have four, 182 has five, and also five pollen paths, 183 has
        one, two, three, or four stamens in different species, with one species being sexually distinct. It is not easy
        to find a genus in the entire plant kingdom whose species differ so much in all the specific parts of the
        fruiting body.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 190.</h3>
        EC. Umbelliferous. This is a natural class as much as EA, and closely related, as especially genera 184-185
        show, and it becomes evident when one mentally gives the individual fruiting bodies of compound flowers stems,
        or takes the stems from the fruiting bodies of the umbelliferous plants.
        <br>
        <br>They mostly have a spindle-shaped main root, always externally marked by rings, from which the smaller root
        strands spring stepwise, often hollow inside and divided by cross-walls.
        <br>
        <br>The stem does not form trees or shrubs but is weak, mostly hollow, with a cross-wall at each leaf and
        strands of woody fibers separated by parenchyma, which shine through as streaks, and when cut transversely, the
        parenchyma gives off an oily-colored sap, while the parenchyma itself exudes a watery one. Branches and leaves
        stand from one side to the other.
        <br>
        <br>The leaves surround the stem with their stalks spread into a sheath, and are rarely simple, but are divided
        by multiple nerves of the stalk into a feathery structure. Each tip of a leaf, or each tooth of a leaflet, has a
        callous point.
        <br>
        <br>The fruiting bodies are arranged in umbels, on noticeably long stems, with a few exceptions, and in compound
        umbels, a few exceptions excluded. Around the union point of the stems, most species have bracts of leaves,
        which can be compared to the flower-cover in EA, either around all union points, both general and specific to
        each small umbel, or only around the latter. Sometimes, however, these bracts are entirely absent.
        <br>
        <br>The fruit consists of two seeds glued together at their flat sides, which separate upon reaching maturity,
        and is covered by the attached flower-cover, the presence of which is indicated by an edge that protrudes over
        the embryo.
        <br>
        <br>On the embryo lies a callous fruit base divided into two hills, from which two pollen paths, five stamens,
        and five flower petals spring. The flower petals are heart-shaped, sometimes flat, but usually raised from the
        split with a tip. Sometimes, flowers at the edge of the umbel differ from those in the middle, as in the starry
        flowers in EA, and in each flower, particularly those directed towards the circumference of the umbel, the
        petals are larger than their adjacent petals. Occasionally, especially in crowded umbels, there are sterile
        flowers in the center.
        <br>
        <br>EC. 185. has fruiting bodies without stems on a cone-shaped raised base.
        <br>Also has fruiting bodies without stems, but in a flat arrangement.
        <br>
        <br>187-190. Have flattened seeds and notably broad leaves. 187. Differs particularly through its bracts and
        simple leaves.
        <br>
        <br>191-192. Have winged seeds.
        <br>
        <br>193-199. Have striped seeds of varying noticeable thickness in length.
        <br>
        <br>200-201. Differ through the crown formed from the flower-cover that protrudes above the seed.
        <br>
        <br>202-204. Have hairy and spiny seeds.
        <br>
        <br>203-204. Have notably starry umbels.
        <br>Differ particularly through its bracts made of large feathery leaves.
        <br>Also differs through the leaves of its bracts, which are arranged only on one side.
        <br>
        <br>206-207. Have long, pointed seeds.
        <br>
        <br>208-211. Have no bracts at all, neither around the general nor around the individual umbels.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 191.</h3>
        ED. Starry Plants. Like the umbrella-bearing plants, they also have a fruit covered by the flower cup,
        consisting of two seeds. Most of our native species are round. The flower sitting on the embryo is single-leafed
        and regular; in some species, it is flat or radially shaped, in others funnel-shaped, usually with four, and in
        a few with three indentations, with as many stamens as indentations, and a two-lobed pollen path. Some species
        not growing in our areas have male flowers or, in fact, infertile hermaphroditic flowers intermixed with fertile
        ones. The fertilizations are located on stems, which typically break up into small branches, in a panicle-like
        formation.
        <br>
        The stem is mostly square or otherwise angular, weak, so it requires support from other bodies, and spreads out
        in a way that appears segmented through the leaves, which sit in a whorl around it. Often, there are ear-like
        structures beside the leaves, and the leaves are always simple, mostly narrow, with a lance-shaped tip.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 192.</h3>
        EE. What has been said above for EA also applies here. This cannot be considered a natural class, but the same
        genera share much in common and serve to connect several classes from different sides. They have opposite leaves
        and enclosed seeds in a fruit with compartments, which are juicy in species 215-218 and 221, and dry in species
        219-220, with their fertilizations connected by their position in a sort of union.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 215, 216, 217 approach the umbrella-bearing plants, especially 215 and 216.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 218-221 approach ED.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 193.</h3>
        EF. This is not a natural class by its scope but contains three natural families. In some species of 223, the
        flower cup does not completely cover the fruit, but it is only attached to the base of the embryo, leaving a
        space between the flower and the fruit. The two families 222-227 have a dry fruit with compartments and many
        seeds.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 222-224 have a juicy stem and leaves, with little noticeable venation. Genera 222 and 223 have a
        capsule with two compartments and beaks; 223 has five petals, while 222 has no petals from the cup but a simple
        yet colored flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 224 seems to connect family 222, 223 with families 225-227, especially with 225 due to its additions
        or lobes in the flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 225-227 produce milk and share the main characteristic of their similarity in the stamens, which come
        together over the pollen path and stigma.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 228 is the only native example from the gourd family. These are creeping plants with square stems and
        branches at the angles between the stem, with angular or fragmented leaves on stalks from one side to the other.
        They have flowers with partially separated sexes, each with a five-part flower and flower cup. The filaments and
        anthers are joined in various ways. The fruit is a capsule covered in flesh with three compartments.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 194.</h3>
        FA. This group contains many trees and shrubs, and in general, all these plants have a solid, compact, woody
        substance.
        <br>
        <br>The leaves are attached to stems, with ears mostly attached to the stem, though in some cases, they are
        attached to the trunk and easily fall off, as in 229 and 230. The fibers of the stem create a noticeable tissue
        in the leaf with strong, palpable veins, often separating from each other, forming finger-like lobed and pinnate
        leaves, sometimes mixed with large and small scales.
        <br>
        <br>The flower cup has a depression, around which, like a ring, sit the flower petals and filaments. Outside
        this ring, the cup is often divided into two distinct layers of lobes. In genus 229, the embryo seems not to be
        fused with the flower cup, and before the fruit ripens, the cup falls off. In others, however, the flower cup,
        particularly its mentioned depression, forms the base for the fruit. In many species, the fruit is completely
        enclosed in the "belly" of the flower cup, which grows and becomes fleshy, forming a navel-like structure on
        top. In others, the lobes of the cup fold over the ripening seeds inside it. In genera 235, 244, and 245, the
        flower is absent; in the others, it consists of five, rarely four, rose-like petals. In some, the number of
        filaments equals the indentations of the flower cup, while in others, two or more times as many filaments form
        clusters of unequal lengths. Only in some species of 235, 236, and 237 does sex differentiation occur, or
        rather, the hermaphrodites are incomplete on either the male or female side.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 229 produces stone fruit or a nut covered in flesh. The flower cup falls off before the fruit ripens.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 230 produces a capsule covered by the flesh of the attached flower cup.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 231-233. The flower cup becomes a fleshy fruit closed in a navel-like structure, with as many seeds
        as there are pollen paths.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 234. The "belly" of the flower cup becomes a transparent berry.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 235. Produces a berry without a navel. It has no flower petals.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 236. Produces several capsules from each flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 237-248. Have an indefinite number of bare seeds in the bottom of the flower cup, each carrying its
        pollen path alongside its tip. In 238, the depression of the flower cup becomes bulging and closes at the top,
        like in 231-233; in others, the depression is flat, or the seed pod rises from it. In 237 and 239, the seed pod
        becomes juicy and forms a berry, and in 237, especially, each seed is covered with flesh. In 244, there is only
        one seed, and in 245, only two, and neither has a flower.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 195.</h3>
        FB. They also have a multi-petaled flower, with stamens sitting on the flower cup in the same indentations. In
        some species, especially 249, the cup and the young fruit are connected. The fruit is a capsule in all cases.
        The leaves in most species are opposite each other.
        <br>
        However, this division is not a natural class. Genus 249, with its non-native relatives, seems to approach the
        EF family (225-227). The lobes of their flower cup fall off, but its "belly" is attached to the fruit and opens
        into segments. In genera 250 and 251, there is no noticeable connection between the cup and the fruit. In genus
        252, the cup grows attached to the fruit after flowering.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 196.</h3>
        G. In total, they have a single-leafed flower except for genera 329-331, and the stamens are incorporated into
        the tube of the flower, in the same number as the indentations of the flower, where it is regular, and in most
        irregular flowers, in a non-matching number. The GE division makes an exception in terms of the position of the
        stamens, which will be explained later. All are hermaphroditic without exception.
        <br>
        <br>GA. Pure herbs. Their leaves are opposite each other on the stem, without petioles, and are mostly covered
        with stiff hairs and rough dots, giving them a rough texture.
        <br>
        <br>The flowers are in a one-sided spike, initially coiled in a spiral from the top down, and during blooming,
        they uncoil and straighten.
        <br>
        <br>The flower and flower cup are five-parted, regular, except for a few. Many have certain protrusions between
        the tube and mouth of the flower. The filaments are five. The pollen path is tube-like with a simple stigma,
        around the base of which four seeds are situated, and are more or less attached to the style. In some species,
        the skin of the seed peels off, so that it can be regarded as a capsule. In general, the fruit of these flowers
        must be imagined as a capsule divided into compartments, stripped of its shell, in which the style forms the
        column from which the seeds hang, or as four capsules standing in a circle around a column, as will be shown in
        HC. In most species, the flower cup covers the ripening fruit.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 197.</h3>
        GB. These plants have a square stem, paired branches crossing each other, opposite leaves without petioles, and
        fertilizations in the angles of the leaves, which are arranged around the stem in a whorl or crown, sometimes
        lifting up on a common main stem. The stem is mostly straight, relatively rich in woody fibers, often becoming a
        shrub, but no trees are found among our natives. The leaves have very strong venation, often wrinkled, often
        hairy, often sprinkled with deep dots, mostly simple, and only rarely divided.
        <br>
        <br>The flowers are irregular. The flower cup always has a deep tube or "belly," in which the seeds ripen, but
        the opening is regular in some species with five lobes or teeth, and in most, irregular with a lip-like
        division, usually with three teeth on the upper lip and two on the lower lip.
        <br>
        <br>The flower typically has a tube that protrudes above the belly of the cup, and a lip-like opening with five
        main indentations, where two upward-facing lobes belong to the upper lip and three in a horizontal position
        belong to the lower lip, with the middle one usually extending over the side lobes. The two lobes of the upper
        lip are often fused, forming a helmet-like arch over the stamens. Occasionally, the upper lip seems to disappear
        or is flattened, and the entire opening takes on a regular appearance. The back of the flower is inward, the
        opening between the lips, and the lower lip is turned outward, but in some foreign species, the orientation is
        reversed.
        <br>
        <br>The stamens are four, in two pairs: one longer and higher in position, the other shorter and lower in
        position, emerging from the back of the flower tube beneath the upper lip. Their filaments run down the tube as
        noticeable stripes. In some genera, only one pair of stamens is found.
        <br>
        <br>The pollen path comes from the middle of the four seeds, bending toward the back of the flower between the
        two pairs of stamens, and splits in a fork-like fashion into two pointed, slightly unequal stigmas, one of which
        faces the back of the flower and the shorter one is bent outward.
        <br>
        <br>The fruit consists of four seeds that are attached around the pollen path. This fruit is best imagined as a
        capsule stripped of its shell, where the pollen path with its base forms the central column.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 262, 263, 268 only have one pair of stamens, but genus 268 has a transverse thread on each, with a
        complete anther at one end and an incomplete one at the other.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 262-264 generally have a regular flower with a flat, spreading mouth all around.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 275-278 have a covering of flower petals around the flower crown.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 279, 280 have a completely regular flower cup.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 281, like a few others, such as 263, bears its flowers on multi-parted stems.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 282 is distinguished by its very peculiar flower cup, whose opening has a smooth edge and on the back,
        a lid-like structure, which, after flowering, closes the cavity.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 198.</h3>
        GC. In many species, branches and leaves are arranged on the stem opposite each other, and cross-paired; in many
        others, they lack a specific arrangement, and often only the lower leaves are opposite, while the upper ones are
        not. Among our native species, there are neither shrubs nor trees.
        <br>
        <br>The flower and flower covering are irregular; the latter is variously split, but its lobes always align with
        the flower and do not bend flatly outwards.
        <br>
        <br>The flower mostly has a lip-shaped opening, except in 283, where it is usually regular and flat, and in 284,
        296, 297, where it takes on a more bell-shaped form. In the others, it is helmet-shaped and mask-like.
        <br>
        <br>There are four stamens in two pairs, as in GB, except for 283, 294, and 295, where there are only two, and
        in 297, where there are three.
        <br>
        <br>The young fruit carries a pollen pathway with a simple stigma and develops into a capsule, which usually
        splits from the top into two pieces, containing many seeds in one or mostly two chambers, sitting on a
        fruit-bearing bed that rises within the capsule.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 283-291, 297 have two chambers in the capsule.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 292-296 have only one chamber.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 296, although it deviates somewhat from the main character of the class, seems to fit best here.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 292-295 differ by their particular growth habits, and stems without leaves, which in 294 are found
        only at the root, in the others not at all, replaced instead by scales.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 199.</h3>
        GD. This division is not natural in its entirety but contains many families that are.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 298-302 are still related to the previous division, mainly differing in the number of filaments, as
        they have five. Genera 298 and 301 also have somewhat irregular flowers, and together with 299, their filaments
        are bent away from the straight direction.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 303 is closely related to the previous ones but differs by its fruit, which becomes a berry, and by
        its stamens, which bend towards each other and stick together at their anthers. The position of the flower on
        the stem is also remarkable, either above the angle between the leaf and stem, to the side, or opposite.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 304, 305. The lobes of the flower are somewhat skewed to one side. The fruit consists of two pods
        that open inwards through a slit. In 305, they have fused into one, though separated at the top. The two stigmas
        are covered by the anthers in 305, while in 304, they are covered by a separate part of the flower. The leaves
        are opposite each other on the stem.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 306-312 have a radially split flower with one stamen in each split. A round capsule without chambers,
        filled with a rounded body in which the seeds are enclosed. In 312, the flower is absent.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 313-315 have a flower in a presentational plate shape, with bracts around their flower stems coming
        directly from the root. 313 has single flowers. In 314 and 315, they are in umbels.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 316-318 have densely clustered flowers in a spike. The flower is four-parted and radially
        symmetrical. In 318, it has a tube that surrounds the fruit, with only the opening being radially symmetrical.
        In 316 and 317, no such tube is present, and the flower is attached to the upper edge of the fruit, which is
        located between the flower and its covering.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 319 is related on one side to the preceding genera, and on the other side to 222-224. It is notable
        for its stem, which is bare of leaves and nourishes itself through suckers from other plants.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 320 is related on one side to its preceding neighbors, and on the other side, it seems related to GE.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 321, 322 have a four-parted flower with two stamens. Our native species of 322 has flowers with
        separate sexes and no covering.

        GE. These are mostly perennial plants, some with persistent leaves, always with stems and scales on the stems of
        the flowers, which are usually clustered or in a spike. The stamens are located at the base of the fruit and are
        sometimes, as seen best in 328, 330, fused into a ring, which differentiates the one-leafed flowers of this
        class from all other one-leafed species in G. The stamens are either double or equal in number to the parts of
        the flower, and their anthers are mostly composed of a pair of tubes, which are most distinctly seen in 329, and
        in 323-327, they are still equipped with two outwardly pointing tips, from which the name of the class is
        derived. The flower covering in 323 surrounds the fruit at its base so that the flower appears to stand on the
        fruit, as in EE. In the others, it is only attached to the bottom of the fruit. In some species, the fruit is a
        berry with chambers, in others, a capsule with chambers, which can be counted externally by the grooves on the
        capsule. There is only one pollen pathway, but its stigma is sometimes divided, like the capsule. Genera 329-331
        have a multi-leafed flower, which technically does not belong under G but cannot be separated from their
        relatives in GE. 323-328.
        <br>
        <br>In some flowers, which have an egg-shaped or barrel-shaped form, the stamens follow when the flower is
        removed, and seem to have their seat at the lowest edge, but it seems more natural to imagine that this ring is
        fused to the flower, as in HC. 353, 354, where a cylinder formed of stamens is fused with the flower. In these
        barrel-shaped flowers, the number of stamens is double the number of incisions in the flower, which is otherwise
        unheard of in one-leafed flowers.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 328 has only five stamens with its five-parted fruit.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 323-327 have a four-parted flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 323 has the flower on the fruit.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 323, 324 bear berries.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 330 differs by its fruit, but its fused stamens, stem, and leaves compared to 327 show its
        relationship.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 331 finds its place here when compared to 329, according to root, stem, and fruit.

        <h3>§. 201.</h3>
        HA. These plants generally have regular flowers, which are very similar to the one-leafed regular flowers in GA
        or GD, both in their shape. The difference lies mostly in the incisions: in the one-leafed flowers, the incision
        only divides the opening, while in these multi-leafed flowers, the incisions extend through the tube all the way
        to the base. Furthermore, in those plants where the stamens are present in double the number compared to the
        parts of the flower, half of these shorter stamens are attached to the nails of the flower petals, while the
        longer ones stand on the bottom of the fruit. Additionally, the clove-like flowers 332-337 share more similarity
        with 313-315, and the Alsine-like flowers 338-345 with 306-312.
        <br>
        <br>They are all herbs with opposite leaves without stems, and branches are arranged crosswise. Often, the stem
        divides continuously into two parts.
        <br>
        <br>The young fruit has its own free base, arising from the tip of the stem and separated from the flower
        covering, on which the flower petals and stamens stand simultaneously. This base noticeably rises above the
        basin of the flower covering in some species of genera 332-337 as a small column. The fruit develops into a
        capsule with segments, chambers, and a small column for the seeds. There is sometimes a separation of sexes, but
        in fact, they are mostly imperfect hermaphrodites with a trace of the missing sex part.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 332-338 have a cleft but one-leafed flower covering.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 332-337 have clove-like flowers, except for 337, and usually a notched nail, often with an additional
        part between the tube and the opening, making a total of two sets of five stamens.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 332-335 have three or five stamens.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 336, 337 have only two stamens.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 339-344 have a flower covering completely divided into leaves, and many of the petals are also split.
        Genus 344 has a four-parted flower. In general, they have stamens in double the number of the parts of the
        flower, though some species have only one set. The stamens number three, four, or five.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 338, 345 seem to lack a distinct position.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 202.</h3>
        HB. HC. Both divisions have capsules arranged in a ring around a common central point, but in HB, they are
        separate, while in HC, they are connected at a common area, forming a sort of simple fruit with chambers. Each
        capsule or chamber tapers towards the central point and opens along this slit. Genus 350 serves to connect both
        divisions with each other and with other classes. The area or small column, where the connected capsules meet,
        consists of filaments placed downward, which separate at the top and spread out into as many stigmas as there
        are capsules or chambers. The unconnected capsules each have their own filament, but it is placed on the side
        facing the central point, so the capsules are only slightly pressed together near the central point, resembling
        those that are connected at a column.
        <br>
        <br>HB. Has four, five, or six unconnected capsules, with two rows of unequal-length stamens, one row of which
        is attached to the flower petals. At the edge of the fruit base, on which the capsules sit, there is a
        gland-like structure under each capsule. In 348, there are stems with separated sexes, i.e., imperfect
        hermaphrodites. They have fleshy parenchymatous leaves, as do 351, and some species of 352, and genera 222, 223
        also approach them in this regard. They carry their flowers in a flat cluster.
        <br>
        <br>HC. Has connected capsules or chambers, with 350 lacking a column extending beyond the fruit, and the others
        351-354 having such a column, which dissolves into a bush of stigmas at the top.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 351-354. The stamens in these genera have grown together at the bottom, somewhat imperceptibly in 351
        and 352, but more clearly in 353 and 354. They have leaves with ear-like structures on fairly long stems, which
        usually do not lie in the same plane as the leaf, but instead, the leaves are carried shield-like, and when
        entering the leaf, the nerves radiate from a central point.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 351, 352. As mentioned, these have slightly fused stamens and completely separate flower petals.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 353, 354. In this class, which is numerous in other parts of the world but only found in a few
        species in Northern Europe, the stamens have fused into a tube around the column, but they separate at the top,
        and the anthers are freely exposed. This tube widens at its base and connects with the nails of the flower
        petals, so that the flower with the stamen tube can be removed as a unified body.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 203.</h3>
        HD-HF. In all these herbs, the base of the fruit is so independent of the flower structures that in all (except
        a few non-native species), both the floral envelope and the flower itself fall off shortly after blooming, and
        long before the fruit ripens. This circumstance makes the boundaries in the HD section between what should be
        called the calyx or corolla particularly unstable and unclear. See §. 59. This also raises the question in the
        same section of what should be called the flower or the side part, the corolla or the nectarium. The filaments
        have their position on the base of the fruit and no relation to the flower. Separation of sexes is extremely
        rare in this entire section, and there are no examples among our native species.
        <br>They are all herbs with leaves in an indeterminate position, from one side to the other, without actual
        stems.
        <br>
        <br>HD. They bear many fruits on their common fruit base, and each fruit tapers towards the middle of the fruit
        base, which forms the path for the pollen. These fruits are capsules in some species, opening from the
        inward-facing side, in others, they are bare seeds, or, if you like, capsules that do not open.
        <br>HD. Genera 355-359 have bare seeds.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 355 has a four-petaled simple flower, namely not both a flower and floral envelope at the same time.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 356 has a many-petaled simple flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 357-359 have flowers and floral envelopes.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 360-364 bear capsules.
        <br>
        <br>In these 360-364, the already mentioned question arises: what should be called the floral envelope, flower,
        and side parts of the flower, calyx, corolla, nectarium? Namely, close to and between the filaments are
        variously shaped, tubular colored parts (except 360), several in a ring around the capsules in 361, 362, a few
        or only a pair next to each other inward or on the side of the fruit base facing the stem in 363, 364. On the
        outside, there are other colored parts or flower petals, in 361, 362 also arranged in a circular pattern,
        similarly shaped to rose petals, in 363, 364, however, differing in arrangement and shape, with one particularly
        serving as a covering for the so-called side parts. If one compares these side parts without prejudice to the
        flower petals of genera 358, 359, whose claw is also somewhat tubular in shape, one might not be unwilling to
        regard these so-called side parts, the nectarium, as the flower and the so-called flower as the floral envelope.
        Therefore, one must speak as follows:
        <br>
        <br>Genus 360 has a simple flower or floral envelope without a flower.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 361, 362 have a regular complete flower, a floral envelope made of rose-like petals, a flower made of
        hollow, tubular petals, 361 in an indeterminate number, 362 in a definite number.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 363, 364 have an irregular complete flower, namely a pair of irregularly shaped flower petals on one
        side of the flower, and five also irregularly shaped petals of the floral envelope, one of which encloses the
        flower petals.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 204.</h3>
        HE. HF. Have a single fruit per flower. This fruit is a capsule, often of considerable length, called a pod, and
        the seeds are attached to the sutures of the capsule segments. The number of these segments and their sutures is
        indefinite, usually two, and the fruit does not always open at its sutures, nor is it always divided into
        compartments along its entire length; the septa sometimes extend from the sutures only to a certain distance,
        without reaching the center or opposite suture. In general, the pollen path is imperceptible and insignificant,
        and the stigma is usually directly on the fruit, sometimes also divided like the capsule itself. The flower is
        regular (except 368, 369), with many petals. The floral envelope has two petals or two sets of two petals in
        different layers. The number of filaments is definite in some, indefinite in others.
        <br>
        <br>HE. Is distinguished from HF. on the one hand by the indefinite large number of filaments in 365-367, on the
        other hand by the two-petaled floral envelope in 366-369, as well as by the irregular flower in 368, 369, along
        with other differences.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 365 has a juicy fruit or berry, with a groove at the suture.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 366 has a long capsule or pod made of two segments.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 367 has a round capsule, which is divided into many compartments inside, covered at the top by a
        multi-lobed permanent stigma like a shield, and under this shield, it opens to a certain width along its
        sutures.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 368 has an irregular many-petaled flower, and two filaments, each with three anthers. The species in
        this genus are extremely varied in flower and fruit: one of our few native species has a seed in a round
        capsule.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 369 also has an irregular five-petaled flower, five filaments, and a capsule with five segments.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 205.</h3>
        HF. Plants with cross-shaped flowers. They bloom in a spike that does not terminate as usual with a point but
        instead ends in a flat bouquet, and during the blooming period, it lengthens as the lowest flowers of the
        bouquet gradually bloom. The leaves have a noticeably strong rib at the base, whose fibers often separate into
        strings, creating what are incorrectly called pinnate leaves, as this class particularly exhibits so-called
        layer-like leaves.
        <br>
        <br>The flower consists of four clove-shaped petals that are arranged crosswise or side by side, or rather in a
        rectangle, with two somewhat longer and two somewhat shorter sides. Occasionally, the flower petals facing the
        edge of the bouquet, especially in the outer flowers of the bouquet, are larger than the other pair of petals,
        so that the bouquet is starry, as with the umbrella flowers. The filaments and petals surround the fruit on its
        somewhat spongy or fleshy fruit base, similar to the umbrella flowers, and as they are sometimes sunken into
        hollows in the base, small glands appear between them as small hills. On each of the broader sides of the
        flower, there is a pair of filaments, and on each of the narrower sides, there is an unpaired filament, so that
        there are six filaments in total. The paired filaments are slightly longer than the unpaired ones, though this
        is often only an optical illusion, as the unpaired filaments are somewhat lower and often curved. The floral
        envelope has two pairs of leaves, where the ones above the unpaired filaments are somewhat lower in position and
        often droop downward, with a cutting edge upward.
        <br>
        <br>The fruit has a short pollen path and a stigma divided into two lobes. It is long or short, a pod or a small
        pod, and otherwise varies in shape in many ways, usually divided into two compartments by a septum, which
        sometimes extends beyond the capsule segments. Sometimes the space is undivided, sometimes the segments do not
        open, and sometimes the pod breaks in transverse sections. In the small pods, the segments are often hollow and
        raised into a hump or knife-like ridge, so that the vertical cross-section through both segments is wider than
        the septum, which is said to be directed toward the segments, while conversely, it is parallel to them. The
        seeds hang alternately at both sutures, on both sides of the septum.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 370-377 have long pods with regular segments without joints.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 378-380 have jointed pods, with 380 having only one joint.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 381, 382 have short pods that do not split into segments, with 381 being angular.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 383-391 have small pods that split into two segments.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 383-386 have thick, bubble-like small pods.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 387-391 have flattened small pods.
        <br>
        <br>Note: 383 and 391 are mistakenly swapped. 383 should be placed under the line before 387, and 391 should be
        placed above the line after 386.

        HG. HH. Both are not natural divisions, and the genera placed under them mostly require comparison with many
        foreign plants to determine their correct position, which is generally difficult to establish.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 392-395 have a capsule with compartments, and their seeds are attached to the septa or the column.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 396-398 have a capsule without septa, which in 398 opens entirely into three segments, while in 396
        and 397, it only splits to a certain width at the top. The seeds are attached to the segments.

        <h3>§. 207.</h3>
        HI. With the exception of genus 418, which has no relatives in our region, this class of plants with pea-like
        flowers is very natural. Among our native species, there are few herbaceous plants and no trees, but some of
        these plants are found in this class. The stem bears its branches and leaves alternately, changing direction
        somewhat with each branch, most noticeably in herbs, and is angular. The leaves have noticeably long petioles
        with ears that are attached to the stem; they are sometimes simple, mostly pinnate, ending with an unpaired
        leaf, including the three-leafed varieties, or with a pair of leaves. In this case, the rib often extends into
        loops or forks. Each leaf has its own small petiole that extends through the leaf, often protruding slightly
        above the tip, dividing it into two equal parts, and giving off parallel veins at sharp angles. The flowers
        emerge from the angles between the leaf and the stem on individual pedicels or stalks, or at the ends of the
        branches, always in a half-hanging position. The floral envelope is single-petaled with an approximately
        bell-shaped space and usually five points along the edge. The flower and filaments originate from the floral
        envelope, but not as in section F, at the edge, but at the base of the cavity. The flower is a pea flower, which
        was already described in §. 64. The filaments are ten, of which usually nine are fused at their lower part, so
        that the upper part with the anthers is free, forming a closed sheath, with which the young fruit is surrounded,
        and the curvature of the filaments follows the shape, thus curving toward the banner. Sometimes, one filament,
        the topmost, is detached from the others in the sheath. The fruit is positioned at the tip of the petiole, which
        sometimes extends into the floral envelope, and along its back, a pollen path noticeably extends beyond the tip,
        often with a flat, hairy stigma. The fruit becomes a pod of various shapes, usually without partition, and the
        seeds hang at the upper broader suture, whose continuation, as previously mentioned, is the pollen path.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 403-407 have long, straight, more or less flat pods.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 408-409 have a pod divided into two compartments along its length.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 410 has a long cylindrical pod.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 411 has a long segmented pod.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 412 has a spirally twisted pod.
        <br>
        <br>Genera 413-414 have very short pods, barely or not protruding from the floral envelope.
        <br>
        <br>Genus 416 has a fluttering or splitting flower and usually simple leaves.

        <h3>§. 208.</h3>
        The intention with this eleventh section was to go further, but it could not proceed in an introduction beyond
        some explanation of the list contained in §. 146, and a summary explanation of the most important plant families
        occurring in Northern Europe. Only in the subsequent list of our native herbs is a closer determination of the
        so-called genera or smallest collections of species, or divisions of large families made. Meanwhile, since in §.
        153 the summarized characteristics of the Linnaean genera are inserted, a comparison of the numbers from the
        list in §. 146 with the divisions of the method outlined in §. 153 has recently been added here, so that the
        characteristics of the genera can be quickly located.

        <h2>Twelfth Section</h2>

        <h3>§. 209.</h3>
        In terms of its origins, herbal knowledge is very old, but its reliability and true form as a science were
        attained rather late. The reliability of the historical knowledge of plants, and therefore all knowledge of
        their usefulness, is based on the efforts of botanists to compare plants with one another, to set
        characteristics for each species based on their conspicuous form, to arrange them according to their
        similarities or differences, and to present a convenient plan of organization to learners. This was a task that
        was only undertaken after the general revival of all sciences in Europe, and perhaps the necessity for this task
        was due to the prior complete decline of scientific knowledge. Thus, just as with all history of human events,
        we must distinguish between the times of history preserved by tradition and the times of thoroughly written
        history flowing from verifiable sources. If one knows a plant by its character, then one knows it thoroughly: if
        one knows it because it has been shown to them and its name has been told to them, then it is only a traditional
        knowledge. If one has not even had the opportunity to have it shown to them, then there is no way to acquire
        knowledge of it, and in these circumstances, both learned and unlearned people were before the invention of the
        true foundation of the entire science.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 210.</h3>
        Herbology certainly shares its origins with medicine, and both can be traced back to the times when, in ancient
        Greece, under a mild climate, the sick were brought to public places to seek the advice of anyone who had
        counsel to give. In fact, this was the best way, in a matter where experience had to be the first teacher, as it
        always will be the best, to collect experiences which the wisest would record and preserve as the foundation of
        the emerging science. From this common origin, herbal knowledge was regarded as a branch of medicine and mainly
        left to the physicians to pursue, and even in our times, this remains the prevailing opinion and practice. The
        sick, especially those who are not treated according to already established methods of healing, reach out in
        their distress to any remedies that seem to offer help, and naturally, they first look to the plant kingdom.
        Thus, it was not long before the plants that gained fame for their healing powers grew into a noticeable number,
        thereby imposing on physicians the necessity to focus primarily on the plant kingdom. Gradually, it was also
        possible to consider this kingdom from other perspectives than merely as something useful to physicians, and
        somewhat, Pliny and, in the last century, Rajus did this. However, the primary purpose of botany has remained
        the use of plants for medicinal purposes. The plants that people engage with in agriculture and various branches
        of civic professions represent, each of these occupations taken separately, only a modest number in comparison
        to the medicinal plants that have become famous, deservedly or undeservedly, and it is only in our times that we
        begin to approach the arts and professions that nourish us or make life comfortable on the footing of a science.
        Only in the eyes of one who reflects on the influence of herbal knowledge in all of these professions and
        industries, and the vast number of plants that are used for so many particular purposes, does herbal knowledge
        acquire the worth and rank of a science in its own right.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 211.</h3>
        The inconveniences of relying on tradition in herbal knowledge have necessarily been felt throughout the ages,
        but they were felt without being recognized. In the writings of the Greeks and Romans, there is no trace of the
        thought of linking the memory of plants and their names to the unchanging characters that nature has impressed
        upon them, nor any trace of a method for this purpose. Not every division of a work into books and chapters, nor
        any arrangement of thoughts and materials, which certainly no reasonable man would write a book without,
        deserves the name of a botanical method, for at least the method should aim to lead to the recognition of the
        unknown. But the aim of the ancients was not so much to establish historical knowledge, but, with the assumption
        of this knowledge, to teach the usefulness of plants. Only the lesser-known plants did they take the trouble to
        describe, without regard to the entire plant kingdom, and without knowing what we have learned in modern times,
        that such isolated descriptions, without such consideration, are of no use. These descriptions were, in fact,
        already of no use in their time, and Galen declared it a futile effort to try to convey knowledge of plants with
        words, saying that the only way to gain knowledge was for a teacher to show and name the plants. Pliny, on the
        other hand, recounts how Cratevas and others had plants painted, and wrote their uses under the paintings, but
        he considered these paintings inadequate and demanded descriptions, though in his writings, he followed no more
        order than the others that would deserve to be called a method. Since the descriptions of plants in the writings
        of the Greeks and Romans were already incomprehensible in the time of their authors, they must have been even
        more so for the Arabs, who, at the fall of the Roman Empire, preserved the sciences that had been entirely lost
        in the Western lands for some time.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 212.</h3>
        When the interest in the sciences was revived in the Western world, the first thing in herbal knowledge was to
        focus on the writings of the ancients. Amid intense disputes over their interpretation, arguments arose about
        the nature of those disputes where all sides were wrong. The names of plants mentioned in these writings were
        hastily assigned to plants seen around them, without considering the natural fact that different countries
        produce different plants, and that there is a noticeable difference between Greece in Europe and Asia, as well
        as between the Western lands, and particularly the northern parts of Europe where these interpreters lived. This
        hasty application of names from the ancient writings, coupled with an even more careless use of the information
        about the uses of the herbs, filled the writings about medicinal plants with a great deal of testimony, which is
        more than useless, because it is always better to have no information than false information. Without a doubt,
        Tournefort, on his journey through the homeland of the ancient Greeks, saw all their 500 or 600 plants for which
        names could be found, among a much larger number. But with certainty, we do not know more than a tenth of them.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 213.</h3>
        In the meantime, the focus shifted from the writings of the ancients to the book of nature, and people began to
        search for herbs in nature with zeal and diligence, not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world,
        which improved navigation had opened new routes to. However, those who had to search for herbs in nature could
        not yet be expected to develop systems. Their attention, when observing the plants, was generally not focused on
        the parts and circumstances that form the foundation of botanical systems. Everywhere, the lifestyle of a
        traveler is not suitable for developing a system.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 214.</h3>
        Cæsalpinus, the predecessor of Harvey in the discovery of the circulation of blood and the father of botanical
        methods, was a professor in Pisa and proudly mentioned the botanical gardens he had been able to explore. As a
        man of deep thought, the Aristotelian philosophy he practiced infused him with a taste for systems and a certain
        spirit of order, which cannot be denied in this philosophy. The gardens provided him the opportunity to
        leisurely and comfortably compare many herbs that he saw growing before his eyes. Traces of a systematic thought
        can be found in Fabius Columna, from a distinguished Roman family, and in Conrad Gesner, a man who was truly an
        ornament of his time, and who, with his all-encompassing genius, spared no effort or personal expenditure. He
        had his own garden and kept artists working for him in his house, so from his entire setup, it can be concluded
        that he had nothing less than a systematic work in mind. However, Cæsalpinus is the first to have executed a
        system in his 16 books on plants, published in Florence in 1583 in 4to, and it is a very profoundly conceived
        system. His entire thorough way of thinking is revealed in the preface of his book to Francesco Medicis. "It
        is," he says, "a sad fate of humanity that after the decline of the sciences, we must start again from the
        beginning; we must start with the large number of herbs as we would with an army, we must divide them into
        troops, for that is what all science consists of, bringing similar things together and separating dissimilar
        ones. Without that, there is no progress; a description, however careful it may be, if it is made without regard
        to the genus to which a plant belongs, renders the plant it refers to almost unrecognizable. The division into
        genera supports memory, facilitates presentation, and helps in recognizing the uses of the herbs, for those
        belonging to a genus generally have similar properties. The genera, however, must be based on the differences
        that nature has imposed in the plants, not on secondary considerations and circumstances outside of the plants."

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 215.</h3>
        Among the first to follow in Cæsalpinus's footsteps is Joachim Jung, who only lacked the opportunity and the
        more favorable times, as were available later in Germany, to do the same as Cæsalpinus, for in sharpness of mind
        and systematic spirit, he was no less than him. Apart from Jung, Cæsalpinus had no successors in his undertaking
        for a significantly long time, and it is especially notable that the authors of general histories of plants,
        such as Dalechamp and the two Bauhins, Caspar and Johann, did not take an interest in it. Particularly Caspar
        Bauhin, who perhaps saw ten times as many plants as Cæsalpinus in his lifetime, must have felt the necessity of
        method as superfluous during his forty years of work on his Pinax. This Pinax, in which Bauhin collected the
        various names of herbs from all writers up to his time, is actually a preliminary register for the large work he
        intended to publish under the title Theatrum botanicum. Although only a small part of this work has been
        published, the register alone deserves the thanks of all times as a concordance of all writers up to his time.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 216.</h3>
        Robert Morison, a Scotsman, a man somewhat preoccupied with his own merits, was luckier than Joachim Jung and
        found in Gaston, Duke of Orleans, a powerful and exceptionally favorable patron of science, under whose
        patronage he worked for many years in the garden at Blois. After the Duke's death, he became a professor of
        botany in Oxford. About a hundred years after Cæsalpinus, whom he never mentions, he introduced a system of
        plant classification in a work, the first part of which is missing, the second of which he himself published in
        1680, and the third was published posthumously by Bobart, containing four and a half thousand plants, with
        illustrations that, admittedly, are not particularly remarkable. His method is essentially a mixed method, based
        primarily on the observation of the fruit, but it also includes other features that do not depend on the process
        of fruiting. It is evident that there was no fixed plan at the start of his work, and it lacks a clearly
        coherent key.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 217.</h3>
        From that time, a large number of different methods quickly emerged, gaining esteem in proportion to the degree
        to which their authors carried them out and established the plant kingdom in detailed works based on these
        methods. Among all, Johann Ray, an English theologian, deserves the praise of all times for being a man of an
        immensely valuable character, who strove to make herbal knowledge useful for all purposes, not just medicinal
        ones. With extraordinary diligence, he had the remarkable humility to acknowledge that one must leave room for
        the always-expected improvements in natural history and not be too hasty in decisions. A man of a slightly
        different mindset, but also a valuable man, August Quirin Rivinus, gave the almost only example of a strict,
        unmixed arbitrary method, where, although not the chosen foundation—namely the regularity and irregularity of
        the parts of the flower—he did adhere to the adopted principles of the method, and his spirit of order and zeal
        for science, evidenced by his beautiful illustrations, which he produced at his own expense despite hardship,
        deserves praise. More will be said about Tournefort, with whom a new century and a new era begins.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 218.</h3>
        Various reproductive organs were gradually adopted as the foundation of methods, and just as in the physiology
        of the human body, where one part of the brain is sometimes assigned as the seat of the soul, so each author of
        a method claimed the part of the plant structure on which their method was based as the most important and
        declared their method the best. Many saw such a method as nothing less than something that should change the
        entire science. Disputes arose, and everyone argued with the same weapons, showing the shortcomings of each
        other's methods and their contradictions to nature, without realizing that the outcome of all their mutual
        objections was that each of these methods, according to the arbitrary methods of nature, had its own special
        usefulness, but none needed to be considered the plan of nature.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 219.</h3>
        With this peaceful mindset, all methods and proposals for methods that have increased to a great number up to
        our time must be viewed. These include original drafts based on new observations of certain aspects of plant
        structure, combinations of several previously mentioned methods, attempts at natural methods or approaches to
        the plan of nature. With these views, one does no wrong to any author but is inclined to give each their due
        credit. Two particular attempts to approach the plan of nature in important works are especially noteworthy: Mr.
        Royen's Prodromo Floræ Leydensis and Mr. Haller's Enumeratione Stirpium Helveticarum. It would be very unjust to
        hold against them the imperfections they themselves acknowledged and the impossibility of maintaining all
        similarities of plants in a cohesive method. One must not focus so much on the remaining path but rather on the
        steps they have truly taken towards the plan of nature, and accept their discoveries and the prospects for
        further progress with thanks. This same just attitude must be held towards Mr. Linné's Fragmenta Methodi
        Naturalis and Mr. Adanson's Familles des Plantes.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 220.</h3>
        In general, the foundations of methods were taken from the different parts of reproduction, and whereas
        previously, those who were the first to search for plants in nature usually overlooked or only superficially
        considered these delicate and not always visible parts of their structure, they were granted such outstanding
        value by the founders of methods that it was believed, as still the prevailing opinion holds, that only these
        parts, to the exclusion of the rest, could and must be taken as the basis of all true methods. However, one has
        early and constantly felt the chains that this preconceived opinion imposed on oneself, and the beautiful
        characteristics, the clear similarities that nature has placed in the less regarded parts of plant structure,
        could not go unnoticed. Morison's method has some, Ray's method many recognized natural classes that have
        received very fortunate names based on such circumstances. Magnol, in his 1689 book Familiæ Plantarum per
        Tabulas Dispositæ, explicitly opposed this prevailing opinion and doubted that methods could not be derived from
        every part of the plant, for example, from the first seed leaves. Boerhaave and even Tournefort often, under the
        characteristics of the genera, did not overlook this feature, and in the Ordinibus in Mr. Linné's Fragmenta
        Methodi Naturalis, one will hardly find the characteristics elsewhere than in the entire structure.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 221.</h3>
        With Joseph Pitton Tournefort, whom France rightfully regards as its ornament, and with the beginning of the
        present century, a new epoch can rightly be started. It was not enough for him to be a founder of a method, like
        so many others, and to classify the plant kingdom into major classes or higher genera; he set out to create a
        system that extended down to the lower or so-called true genera, and to fix such genera and their names for the
        plants for all time, both in words and illustrations. "In botany," says Tournefort, "it is necessary, so to
        speak, to collect similar plants in clusters and unite them into genera: all those which share a common
        characteristic, by which they essentially differ from all other plants, make up a genus; each of these, united
        under one genus, will still show something special and unique, and all those that do so should be considered
        distinct species." For him, the concept of genus preceded the concept of species in the order of his thoughts,
        and the latter should be derived from the former, whereas it might be more natural to say: plants of a species
        are those that have originated from each other and produce others like them. If different species, despite their
        differences, share something similar that distinguishes them from all other plants, then these species can be
        united into a genus. The upper genera, as they arise from the methods, were too broad for Tournefort, and
        therefore inconvenient, their characteristics too verbose, and the dissimilarities between the plants arranged
        within them too great. Thus, he first thought of the genera, and last of the method. He sought first his
        clusters in the wide nature, which he had the opportunity to investigate in particular under the protection of
        the great, with a free choice guided solely by nature. After he had collected enough of them, about 600 in
        number, he then looked for a way to arrange them into a convenient order. His method, in which the flower comes
        first in consideration, is a mixed method.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 222.</h3>
        His genera, even more than his method, found widespread approval, for now botany seemed to have become easy; it
        seemed that one could avoid the overwhelming recognition of the enormous quantity of plants, as one only needed
        to learn 600 genera. Thus, it became so convenient to give a notion of a plant with just one word, the genus
        name, as the few species are easy to distinguish once someone has kindly taken the trouble to establish the
        genera. Soon after the publication of his Institutiones Rei Herbariæ, Tournefort brought many previously unknown
        herbs from the East, and Plümier brought others from the West Indies. Ray adopted Tournefort's genera, as did
        Boerhaave in the catalogue of the rich Leiden Garden, and thus Tournefort's genera received powerful support
        from the large number of organized plants.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 223.</h3>
        Some thirty years after Tournefort, Sir Linnaeus undertook the same work for the entire plant kingdom,
        continuing it for nearly thirty years, and doubling the number of genera. Since Tournefort's time, a large
        number of new plants from all parts of the world had come to light, and Sir Linnaeus decided to examine and
        investigate the entire plant kingdom from a new perspective. There had always been talk of differences in gender
        among plants, but based on obscure and incorrect ideas. Rudolph Jacob Camerarius discovered this in the past
        century; Burchhard, a doctor from Brunswick, took it up at the beginning of the present century with the
        intention of creating a method based on the parts of fructification, where the difference in gender is based on
        the stamens and pollen tubes. Boerhaave also observed these often neglected parts in his determination of
        genera. But Sir Linnaeus created a system based on the difference of gender with the utmost care and
        immortalized it through his general catalog of the plant kingdom. However, this system, in and of itself, as an
        arbitrary botanical method, is probably considered by its founder as the least of his merits. Much greater
        merits for science include the improvement of the language of the art, the systematic form of science, the care
        and precision in the observations and descriptions of plants, and above all, the incredibly laborious creation
        of a general catalog of the entire plant kingdom. Considering his similar works and merits in other areas of
        natural history, Sir Linnaeus must be admired as an ornament of our times, and no difference in opinions should
        diminish the respect owed to him. "The genera," says Sir Linnaeus, "like Tournefort, must not depend on any
        system; rather, in their determination, the entire fructification must be considered together, the parts of
        which only come into consideration individually in the methods; in this way, according to nature, genera can
        serve all and any system."

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 224.</h3>
        The establishment of genera would have fully benefited science if they could only be fixed unchangeably, but
        since this is not possible, the establishment of genera becomes the true source of the multitude of names, to
        the undeniable detriment of science and the ever-repeated objection against it. Species are determined by
        nature, but genera are left to human will. Even though a founder of genera may claim to follow nature and
        believe that undeniable similarities are before him, the exact determination of the boundaries and stages of
        those similarities always ultimately depends on arbitrary decision. This leads to the divergence of genera
        established by different authors, and because each author gives names to his genera and assigns species to them,
        the necessary diversity in nomenclature arises, without even mentioning other causes of change in nomenclature.
        Thus, a Tournefortian complains that he must relearn when using Linnaean works, and the Linnaean will have the
        same complaint after 40 or 50 years, if in that time the number of known plants increases as it did between
        Tournefort and Linnaeus, and then someone else sets out to rework the genera of the entire plant kingdom. But
        for the lover of plant knowledge, who does not have the intention or time to make it his main occupation, the
        diversity of genera and the multitude of names become a deterrent, and the widespread expansion of science,
        through which it should be beneficial to all, is hindered. These inconveniences, arising from the variability of
        genera, have been sufficiently felt, and two opposing proposals have been given to remedy them: on the one hand,
        to give genera a large scope to reduce the number of names for them, and on the other hand, to establish many
        genera to prevent changes in their names. However, neither of these proposals solves the fundamental problem
        inherent in the use of genus names, and it can only be remedied through the introduction of individual,
        independent names.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 225.</h3>
        From these considerations, the following epochs in the history of botany emerge:
        <br>
        <br>Epoch. Ancient history, up to the restoration of the sciences in the West. Times of tradition.
        <br>
        <br>Epoch. Up to Cæsalpinus. Times of the interpreters of the ancients and the beginning of new descriptions,
        still without method.
        <br>
        <br>Epoch. Up to Tournefort. Establishment of arbitrary methods with a tendency to form sects.
        <br>
        <br>Epoch. From Tournefort to the latest period. Establishment of genera.
        <br>
        <br>Epoch. Recent times, for the last 30 years. New establishment of genera by Sir Linnaeus. Attempts at natural
        methods. The free or eclectic way of thinking.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 226.</h3>
        The fate of herb knowledge, like that of all sciences dependent on increasing experience, is closely tied to the
        currents of the world, as its superiority lies in the number of plants discovered, the discovery and convenient
        examination of which depends on the world’s movements. It assumed the form of a science when botanical gardens
        began to be established; for without the opportunity to compare plants fresh and throughout their entire
        duration in such gardens, one would hardly be able to devise methods or recognize the similarities of plants.
        Although nearly all public botanical gardens, by their foundation, are actually dedicated to medicinal herbs,
        all plants in general have found their place in these gardens, and botanists have, as is appropriate, not been
        confined to such narrow limits.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 227.</h3>
        Through the discovery of a new part of the world and new lands in previously known parts, through trade expanded
        by improved shipping, through the establishment of European colonies in other parts of the world, and through
        some explicitly undertaken journeys in favor of nature and its works, the number of plants known up to today has
        increased to approximately 7,320 species, according to the latest edition of Sir Linnaeus' catalog, Species
        Plantarum, whose first edition from 1753 contained about 5,900 species. Among these 7,320 plants, 680 are
        cryptogams.
        <br><br>
        By comparing the following four catalogs—Linnaeus' Flora Svecica, Hudson’s Flora Anglica, Jacquin’s Flora
        Vindobonensis, and Gouan's Flora Montpellierensis—we find that, excluding cryptogams, they collectively contain
        about 2,150 species. Each contains approximately the following: Flora Svecica 929, Flora Anglica about 1,100,
        Flora Vindobonensis about 1,060, Flora Montpellierensis about 1,600, and about 700 species are common to all
        four, thus mainly occurring throughout Europe. Therefore, one could probably estimate the total number of
        European plants at around 3,000, about one twenty-fifth of the entire plant kingdom as known up to today. If we
        extend this from Europe to the whole globe, and from the number of European plants to the number of plants that
        might be found in other parts of the world, if they were equally thoroughly and carefully studied, it seems
        unlikely that we would know more than half of the plants created.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 228.</h3>
        Not only in terms of the number of species, but also with regard to the forms and various modifications of the
        vegetative structure, we still do not know much more than half of the plant kingdom. Nature has restricted
        certain forms to specific regions of the earth and climatic zones, so that in other areas, one finds either no
        plants of such a form or only a few species as single examples of such a form. For example, no plant from the
        palm genus is native on this side of the Mediterranean Sea; of 124 species from the mallow genus, only 14 are
        European; of 114 species from the legume class without pea-like flowers, only two are European; however, the
        umbelliferous plants, numbering 200 species, have about 20 European species, and only seven or eight are native
        to regions between the Tropics. The same is true for the class with four-petaled cross-shaped flowers, if one
        excludes the genus Cleome, which, with a similar distribution, follows the same pattern as the umbelliferous
        plants, and so on. Even when a natural class spans various climates, often the species that are widely separated
        from each other are only similar in the main characteristics of the class, such as Borbonia and Afpalathus with
        the other plants bearing pea-like flowers.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 229.</h3>
        When considering this, one should not be surprised that botanists have not yet been able to organize all plants
        into a coherent system, but rather, one should recognize their diligent effort and sharp insight in the
        classification into natural classes. A botanist who only knew a few species from the mallow genus in northern
        Europe would hardly think to form a new class from these few species, but would instead try to place them in
        other classes that they do not fit into. Similarly, it is not surprising that the genera in the generally
        recognized classes are so variably defined by botanists and that every significant increase in new plants
        suddenly brought to light, for example from the eastern parts of the Russian Empire, through botanical
        expeditions, causes changes in the genera and their boundaries. However, it does not follow from this that it is
        too early to attempt to define every single genus with the precision necessary when naming the plants based on
        their genus, especially when the boundaries of these genera are not yet fully understood. For what use are names
        for ideas if their constancy cannot be guaranteed?

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 230.</h3>
        We strive to understand plants so that we can use them, and thus, it is natural to reflect on the relationship
        of fundamental botany to this great goal. Although this is not the place for a history of our understanding of
        the utility of plants, nor for a history of our understanding of their life and growth, we can observe that if
        we count all the plants that have become notable for their supposed utility, it is likely we would not gather
        more than about a tenth of the entire plant kingdom. And how many uses are not merely claimed and unproven,
        especially among medicinal plants, which make up two-thirds of the supposedly useful plants? Indeed, fundamental
        botany would still be necessary for the one-tenth of the plants that are genuinely useful, even if the other
        nine-tenths were entirely useless. And if we are to judge the purposes of the plant kingdom, we must not see
        ourselves as the center of all things, although it is certainly not credible that the usefulness of plants,
        whether as a near or distant purpose of their existence, has been entirely discovered or exhausted. Thus, the
        question arises as to how far fundamental botany, as it is practiced, serves the achievement of the great goal
        of the entire plant knowledge.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 231.</h3>
        The discovery and confirmation of the utility of plants is the work of experience. Professional botanists,
        having already laid the foundation for historical knowledge, are typically far from the opportunities for
        firsthand experience, and they are few in number. Therefore, it is essential that the historical knowledge be
        spread among those who engage with plants in various fields of human life. The lack of such widespread knowledge
        is particularly evident in the economic writings of our time across all nations.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 232.</h3>
        How can such widespread knowledge be expected when fundamental botany is presented only in Latin and not in the
        vernacular languages? Nothing prevents this from being done: one can retain the Latin names for the plants,
        which botanists already use, if only the technical terms, the descriptions, and the entire presentation of the
        science are given in the local language. The Latin names must be kept for the sake of convenience in comparing
        the various names in different languages, allowing one nation to understand another through these common terms.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 233.</h3>
        It is necessary to lead the plant enthusiasts, who cannot make the study of plants their main work, primarily to
        the recognition of the natural classes that appear in the region where they live. It would be desirable if all
        so-called Florae and Horti were organized accordingly. These, the naturally determined similarities, deserve to
        be engraved in memory, but all artificial classes created through arbitrary methods are mere creations of
        imagination and will. Botanists must eventually come to an agreement on the natural classes, and there are not
        so many that it should be difficult to remember them. However, the superiority of one arbitrary method over
        another can be endlessly debated, and there are many of them, with numerous divisions and subgroups within them.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 234.</h3>
        However, one will never be able to fully discover and specify the characteristics of the natural classes if one
        persists in the preconceived notion that only the reproductive parts must serve as the foundation for true
        systems. Instead, one must select the similarities in the entire organic structure and take them where one finds
        them, where nature has placed them, and one will find more than one currently believes if botanists seriously
        set out to examine the other parts with as much care as the reproductive parts. These parts are usually only
        visible at a certain time in the life of a plant, while the other parts are always visible.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 235.</h3>
        The arbitrary methods should be considered as a framework for a building, not yet the building itself. They are,
        especially for beginners, indispensable for finding unknown herbs, and for this purpose, one should only add an
        index to a directory organized according to natural classes, in which the plants of the directory are strictly
        arranged according to the laws of an arbitrary method, and which refers back to the directory. One does well to
        add several of these indexes to such a directory. If one teaches a lover of botany about the true value of
        arbitrary methods and shows him how he can understand and use them without being bound to any one method, he
        will not be discouraged by the multitude of methods, as currently happens.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 236.</h3>
        When one hears botanists complain about changes in nomenclature, it is not surprising that lovers of botany
        complain and lose interest in botany. However, these changes are unavoidable if each plant is to carry the name
        of the genus to which a botanist assigns it. Shouldn't the well-intended suggestion in §. 141 and following be
        realized? All genus names (of both upper and lower genera, generis summi & subalterni) should be regarded merely
        as technical terms.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 237.</h3>
        Moreover, there are more inconveniences in the usual use of genus names and the definitions of genera, such as
        the fact that the concepts of the genera are often omitted and assumed in the directories, especially when large
        genera, which contain many species, are concerned. The definition of the genus is often based only on a few
        major species, and not all species fit in all respects.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 238.</h3>
        One can never do too much for the determination of species, for they are creatures of nature, and their correct
        determination is the basis of everything. For this, illustrations are indispensable, descriptions or
        illustrations in words are also necessary, but one can do one without leaving out the other. A farmer will never
        get to know the grasses from Scheuchzer's Agrostographia and will not easily find it convenient to read their
        descriptions in it. It is true that the engravings are costly, but for the well-to-do lover of botany, the
        shortest and most pleasant way is the cheapest, and the less wealthy, who can see the illustrations in the
        richer editions, always finds with pleasure that many uncertainties are resolved by their sight, which remain in
        the descriptions.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 239.</h3>
        Descriptions and illustrations are equally necessary. What an important and pleasant gift it would be if we were
        to receive two such volumes, as the first itself constitutes, in addition to Linnaeus' Pinax, with descriptions
        of all species, as some already appear in this Pinax. The so-called specific names are too short for
        descriptions (for they are actually that), long descriptions tire, and are not read. Their appropriate scope and
        brevity, with sufficient clarity, are maintained if they are made with respect to the relationships of the
        plants, and only the peculiar properties of each species are mentioned. Who knows these relationships better
        than the author of such a Pinax?

        <h2>Memo regarding the promised explanation of § 96 concerning colors.
        </h2>
        My intention was to include an attempt to define colors and their names in this introduction, but after giving
        further thought to various circumstances, I am led to change this plan and conclude that it would be wiser to
        publish this attempt separately, as will happen shortly. This is all the more so because such a definition of
        colors can be of general benefit to natural history and, in any case, is more essential in zoology than in
        botany.
        <br>
        <br> The method for such a definition is as follows. Colors are phenomena that can be produced in various ways,
        according to preference, through the optician's prism, through chemical mixtures by color artists and dyers, and
        through dry colors, watercolor, oil paints, and melted colors used by painters. Since the watercolor paints of
        miniature artists are commonly used to illustrate natural history, we will adhere to these colors.
        <br>
        <br>Once one determines how this or that color can be produced using watercolors, one obtains a somewhat precise
        understanding of the color, in such a way that people can understand each other and use the same clear language.
        This method becomes much easier and more convenient when a sample of the color produced from the indicated
        mixture is presented as well.
        <br>
        <br>While the diversity and multiplicity of color mixtures are inexhaustible, there is, nonetheless, some
        classification involved. The nuances are not so critical; a few hundred carefully chosen samples of the most
        commonly named colors can easily fit on a few sheets, and such an attempt, although it will always remain
        incomplete, can nevertheless be improved according to preference.
