                   Copenhagen, the 2nd of January, 1762. 
                </h2>

                <br>
                Long since ought I to have waited upon Your Well-born Honour with a Letter, had I thought I might fulfil
                my Duty without regard to whether a Letter, which might seem but a mere Ceremonial Epistle, would be
                agreeable unto You or not. Now, as upon another Occasion I take the Honour to write unto Your Noble
                Well-born Honour, it behoveth me before all other things to declare the Joy with which both my Wife and
                I do remember, and shall never cease most frequently to remember, the Time we spent in Trondhjem, and to
                testify the most sincere Gratitude, unto which the Favour and Goodness shewn us by Your Well-born Honour
                and the most gracious Lady do bind us. At the same time, I entreat the Kindness of Your Well-born
                Honour, that upon any fitting Opportunity, when other of our noble Benefactors in Trondhjem, who
                together with You found Pleasure in rendering our Stay agreeable, might perchance still hold us in good
                Remembrance, You would then assure all these our Benefactors of our Thankfulness, our most humble
                Devotion, and our Wishes for their continued Prosperity.
                <br>
                <br>We do also, in virtue of the Friendship which Your Well-born Honour and the gracious Lady have been
                pleased to bestow upon us, take sincere Part in the Joy which the Birth of an Heir — of which I have but
                this Day received Tidings — must doubtless have occasioned, and we wish that he may increase all other
                Blessings wherewith it shall please God to gladden You.
                <br>
                <br>The afore-mentioned occasion for a Letter — one in which there might be hope that it could in some
                measure appear to Your Well-born Honour worth the perusal, and not wholly to belong to that superfluous
                kind of letters — is afforded me by the recently published first volume of the Writings of the Trondhjem
                Society. The entire Institute, as well as its first fruits, have greatly delighted me; and as I see that
                Historia Naturalis in particular draws the attention of the Society, I am assured that this almost
                inexhaustible source shall offer the Society both opportunity and matter for many fine treatises, which
                — according to the taste of our present century — must needs awaken the attention of lovers of nature,
                and thereby, together with the other excellent pieces, especially those flowing from Your Well-born
                Honour’s elegant pen, contribute to the favourable reception of the writings.
                <br>
                <br>This reflection, together with my long-held desire that the Danish and Norwegian nations might
                contribute to the rise of natural history by gradually making their particular products known, hath
                moved me to offer my humble service to the Society, and to address this offer to Your Well-born Honour,
                as the Society’s chief both Ornament and Support.
                <br>
                <br>This service, I conceive, might consist in the following: As Professor of Botany I have at hand, in
                my lodging, a royal library, which, though principally concerned with Botany, is already furnished with
                a number of costly works pertaining to the whole of Natural History, especially to Zoology, and among
                its parts to Ornithology; and what I do not possess, or do not purchase myself, is gradually supplied by
                my colleague Ascanius.
                <br>
                <br>Though the Regnum vegetabile be properly my allotted domain, I do nonetheless bear a fondness for
                the whole Regnum naturale and have therein a measure of knowledge, as likewise in general Physics.
                Moreover, Norway’s situation and natural constitution are, to me as a widely-travelled peregrinant,
                fairly well known. Consequently, I might occasion a closer examination and description of such things as
                most deserve it; I might communicate to the Society what accounts of such matters are already to be
                found in the writings of naturalists; I might, if such treatises in manuscript were entrusted to me for
                the press, offer my well-meant annotations thereupon, compare illustrations; nor should I refrain, at
                times, from arranging for the making of a drawing or copperplate; I could likewise promote the writings
                abroad, e.g. in the Commentarii de rebus in medicina et historia naturali gestis, Leipzig, &c.
                <br>
                <br>But hath the Right Reverend Bishop Gunnerus — unto whom I hereby present my respects — received my
                Letter concerning the Flora, together with the Notices, and a Letter for Mr. M. Schøning?
                <br>
                <br>In the good hope of enjoying Your Friendship and kind Favour, and with my most humble Compliments,
                as also those of my Wife, to the gracious Lady, I have the Honour to remain, with the most distinguished
                Respect,
                <br>

                <h2>
7th of August 1762.
                </h2>

                <br>
                From the end of May until the close of July, I have been absent on a botanical journey here in Zealand,
                and am now upon the point of setting forth again, in order to complete my circuit. During this my
                absence, two letters and parcels have arrived from the Right Reverend Bishop Gunnerus, containing the
                manuscripts for the second tome of the writings of the Trondhjem Society.
                <br>
                <br>Quite recently I have spoken concerning these writings with Mr. Dass, as also with Mr. Pelt, and I
                am delivering to the former that portion of the notes which pertain not to Historia Naturalis. The
                Rector had but lately returned from the countryside and was about to depart again, intending to remain
                absent until mid-September, and declared that he could do nothing before the autumn; the same must I
                likewise say, nor does it appear that Mr. Pelt, as publisher, is in any great haste.
                <br>
                <br>In sum, I must avow that my office and unsettled manner of life permit me not to be of use to the
                Society in summer, but only in winter; for which reason I wish that the materials might henceforth be
                prepared and sent in time for the beginning of winter, and not at its end.
                <br>
                <br>The Right Reverend Bishop Gunnerus, in supposing that I should add some of my lucubrations, expects
                more than I have promised, which was only that I should be of service to the Society in furthering the
                publication of their writings, according to my humble ability.
                <br>
                <br>Nevertheless, I shall consider what annotations and additions Mr. Tyrholm and I might have to offer
                to Mr. Gunnerus’s treatises in Natural History, and append them at the end of the volume, in the form of
                one or more letters.
                <br>
                <br>Otherwise, with what is presently in the hands of Rector Dass and myself, and what is still expected
                from Mr. Schøning, there will in all likelihood be more than sufficient material for a volume.
                <br>
                <br>Mr. Pelt appeared to regard the drawings with some displeasure, on account of their number, and
                seemed apprehensive of the cost of the copper plates; yet I endeavour to console him with the prevailing
                taste of the present age.
                <br>
                <br>As for the drawing of the Gorgonia, which is in any case too large to be added to a volume in
                octavo, it may very well be abbreviated — or rather, the representation of the entire individual may be
                omitted, for there is too much tautology in that depiction, and a single branch displays the very same
                as may be seen upon all the rest. The arrangement or ramification of the branches, and the size of the
                whole, may more readily be conveyed in a few words than represented in a drawing.
                <br>
                <br>When I write to Doctor Ludvig in Leipzig, who presides over the journal there entitled Commentarii
                de rebus novis in Historia Naturali et Medicina gestis, I shall send him a notice concerning the
                writings of the Trondhjem Society, as likewise to Mr. von Haller in Bern.
                <br>
                <br>The continuation of the Character of the 14th Century, composed by Your Wellborn, I have only
                cursorily perused, for want of time in the present interval between the recently concluded and the
                forthcoming journey; yet I shall read it more thoughtfully upon my return.
                <br>
                <br>If I may — by virtue of the permission granted — venture to express what occurred to me (though, as
                said, upon a perlustratio cursoria), I find myself missing in this continuation that force and
                cheerfulness which render the first treatise so agreeable to read. This continuation seems more an
                epitomised Historia litteraria than a characteristic portrayal.
                <br>
                <br>And I thought I could discern how the method of exposition upon which you had settled imposed some
                constraint upon your lively spirit and elegant pen. May my frankness not provoke displeasure, and I
                shall use it only so far as to express my well-intentioned thoughts; yet it must not, nor should, extend
                to making alterations in Your Wellborn's manuscript.
                <br>
                <br>Should Your Wellborn deem my critique worth hearing ere the printing takes place, there ought to be
                sufficient interval between the communication of the manuscript and the printing thereof, so that at the
                very least the manuscript might be sent back and forth.
                <br>
                <br>The treatise concerning Cetea Scorp., or the sculpin so commonly found in Copenhagen, I know not
                whether it may be deemed of sufficient importance; and I shall submit the matter to the Bishop’s
                consideration before I deliver the two drawings pertaining thereto to the engraver.
                <br>
                <br>May I beg you to convey the following to Mr. Magister Schøning, together with my most respectful
                compliments:
                <br>
                <br>"That I have received his most esteemed letter of the 13th of June, which arrived with Major Holk’s
                sons, and therein the list of ten subscriptions — four for illuminated and six for plain copies of Flora
                Danica, fasciculus primus.
                <br>
                <br>These copies shall be held ready for dispatch with the last ships, should the Reverend Rector see
                fit to make the necessary arrangements for their shipment, as well as for the payment of the monies. I
                likewise request to be informed whether I may include a Danish preface with all copies, or whether it
                should be in Latin for some of them.
                <br>
                <br>The price of the four illuminated copies is 36 Rixdollars, and of the six plain ones 24 Rixdollars —
                in all 60 Rixdollars. From this, a discount of 10 percent is allowed on account of the Rector’s labour,
                leaving a remainder of only 54 Rixdollars.
                <br>
                <br>However, as I have purchased for the Bishop a portable barometer for measuring the height of
                mountains, which is ready to be sent along with the Flora, and costs 6 Rixdollars, I would beg the
                Reverend Rector to collect said 6 Rixdollars from the Bishop, and to remit to me the full sum of 60
                Rixdollars in Banco notes."
                <br>
                <br>I shall show myself a more diligent correspondent during the winter, and in the meantime I remain,
                with sincere and true regard,Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant.

                <h2>
Copenhagen, 26 November 1763
                </h2>
                I must without delay respond to Your Honour’s much esteemed letter of the 12th instant, with regard to
                the matter concerning the pamphlet against the farming of customs in the Œconomical Magazine, and have
                reserved writing on other subjects for another time, as the letter has but recently arrived, and my time
                today is somewhat limited. It would indeed have been most improper, had I demanded said pamphlet; I
                would therefore be most reluctant to let this mistaken notion persist, and beg that the enclosed sheet
                be used for the purpose of correcting it.
                <br>
                <br>But how in the world could anyone have come to suspect me, and who is the author of this subtle
                discovery? Could it be Mr. Gert Hornemann? And does he suppose all malice and enmity in me, merely
                because our wives could not be reconciled, and I did truly think that a civility mingled with
                caprice—such as that shown us by the good Madam Hornemann—was itself a kind of impropriety?
                <br>
                <br>I have heard various others named as the author of the pamphlet, among them Mr. Commercial
                Councillor Hammond; yet I can affirm nothing with certainty.
                <br>
                <br>Should I now offer my opinion of the treatise, it is certain in itself that administration is
                preferable to the farming of this and other sources of state revenue. Yet the question may be examined
                and decided without any necessity of descending into particulars, which become personalities and give
                offence.
                <br>
                <br>The entire piece, both in matter and in manner, reveals the author’s animosity toward the so-called
                "farming family." But what benefit is there in reproaching them for a gain that cannot be deemed
                unlawful, having received the consent of the government? And which, however great, was known to the
                parties involved — just as the Chamber knew, or could know, how great it was.
                <br>
                <br>Nor are all the author’s reasonings well founded. It is indeed one of the evils under the sun, that
                in most kinds of imposts, so many difficulties occur in the collection thereof, whereby the subject’s
                twoskilling is diminished to a single skilling before it reaches the royal treasury; and it is striking
                to hear it claimed that the farming consortium profited by more than alterum tantum.
                <br>
                <br>But it must also be observed, that the merchants who were chief stakeholders in the lease were
                thereby enabled to expand their trade and consequently increase the volume of customs revenue. And it
                does not necessarily follow that — had the customs been administered, and granting that smuggling could
                have been prevented — the overall revenues would have equalled the same; for then those merchants might
                have been less enterprising, and the total commerce would have been lessened.
                <br>
                <br>Permit me to conclude for the present, with the assurance of the respectful regards of myself and my
                wife to Your Honour and Your Lady, and to remain
                <br>
                <br>Your Honour’smost humble servant Oeder Copenhagen, 26 November 1763
                <br>
                <br>P. S. The copies of the second fascicle of Flora Danica will, God willing, arrive with Captain
                Greve, who departed from Fladstrand on the 4th of this month. I beg that this be communicated to Mr.
                Hviding at the Bishop’s, together with my greetings to both.

                It is most unwelcome to me to hear that I am believed in Trondhjem to be the author of that piece in The
                Danish and Norwegian Economic Magazine concerning the Trondhjem customs lease. I therefore entreat Your
                Excellency to contradict this unfounded notion, as there is not a single article in the entire Magazine
                that proceeds from my pen, and to present this note in suitable places, particularly to Councillor of
                State Møllmann, to whom I also take the liberty, on this occasion, of offering my most respectful

                <br>I say that it is something I most unwillingly hear; for, without engaging either with the question
                of customs being better administered or leased, nor with the pamphlet itself, I must simply state that
                such a piece, especially as it stands, could by no means have come from my hand. Should the occasion for
                attributing it to me arise from the fact that during my stay in Trondhjem I endeavoured to inform myself
                regarding the commerce of the diocese – a curiosity most natural to anyone travelling with a degree of
                attentiveness, and whereby I was chiefly moved by the wish to be of service to the late Roger, author of
                the Letters on the State of Denmark – then I may confidently appeal to Your Excellency and to Councillor
                Møllmann, who were graciously pleased to assist me in that endeavour.
                <br>
                <br>You know best, and can assure those good folk who, through want of insight, are often the quickest
                to adopt such mistaken notions, that the information shared with me could by no means have served one
                seeking to probe the advantages of the lease – even if one were to ascribe to me so fruitless and
                frivolous an intent. My sole aim was rather to shed light on the natural resources and needs of the
                country, and to acquire a somewhat accurate knowledge thereof.
                <br>
                <br>Both I regret and am surprised that the conjectures concerning the author of the aforementioned
                piece have not proved more fortunate, since it so evidently betrays an author not so unfamiliar with
                Trondhjem as I am, and an animosity not likely to be found in me.
                <br>
                <br>On the contrary, I ever recall my stay in Trondhjem with pleasure, and shall always consider myself
                indebted to the kind gentlemen and benefactors who, by their goodwill, rendered it agreeable to me. Why,
                then, should I write anything that might offend any of them? For even truths, when they risk provoking
                displeasure without benefit, ought to be left unsaid—especially by one whose calling it is not to speak
                them.
                <br>
                <br>Copenhagen, the 26th of November, 1763.

                <p>
                    Enclosed with the following promemoria is the aforementioned mémoire. Once my most honoured friend
                    has perused it and delivered it to His Excellency Councillor of State Guldberg, and spoken with him
                    regarding my affair—which I earnestly wish and entreat may happen as soon as your circumstances
                    permit—I shall humbly request to be informed thereof, in order that I may thereafter likewise speak
                    more fully with Mr. Guldberg, as well as with you, most esteemed friend, whose friendship I value
                    above all things, but especially so in the present conjuncture, which greatly troubles my mind.
