                    On Banco, Courant, and Coinage
                </h2>

                <section id="chap1">

                    At the establishment of a giro bank, upon its foundation, it is necessary to determine what shall be
                    understood and accepted as a unit: for example, at the Bank of Hamburg, it was decided that
                    calculation and reckoning would proceed according to thalers, – marks (three to the thaler), – and
                    schillings (sixteen to the mark); and that one thaler should be equal in value to four and
                    thirty-seven parts of a Cologne mark of fine silver. A coined piece of silver, which contains
                    precisely that amount of fine silver, without any admixture of unnecessary and worthless alloy, as
                    was current at the time of the founding of said bank, is called a speciesthaler, and during the
                    bank's inception, and also later in concept, it is considered at par and identical in value with a
                    banco thaler.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, once the bank has been established, constituted, and brought to stability, this
                    complete equality and identity between the speciesthaler and the banco thaler ceases – both in the
                    commerce among the bank’s own stakeholders and in their dealings with outsiders. A relationship then
                    arises between the two types of thaler, which, although never excessively divergent, nonetheless
                    deviates somewhat from the original equality or par. The banco thaler becomes a unit of account; the
                    speciesthaler, coinage, and, like all coinage, a commodity.
                    <br>
                    <br>For in the commerce of merchants, a multitude – indeed an infinity – of circumstances intervene,
                    each exerting influence upon the determination of the relationship between the adopted unit of
                    account (the standard used for comparing all objects of commerce) and that which, at any given
                    moment, constitutes the object of negotiation. And the contracting parties agree that the recipient
                    of the good shall have so much credited in banco, while the deliverer shall be debited
                    correspondingly.
                    <br>
                    <br>In such transactions, through the continual daily adjustment of mutual speculations according to
                    prevailing conditions, silver does not retain a constant value; and if the whole – a Cologne mark of
                    fine silver – does not always have the same worth in banco, then neither can the part – namely the
                    speciesthaler, composed of 4/37 of such a mark – maintain a fixed value in banco. He who today
                    deposits 1000 thalers in natura into the bank does not necessarily deliver, as one who at the time
                    of the bank's founding did by subscribing a folium, exactly 1000 speciesthalers or 4000/37 Cologne
                    marks of fine silver; rather, he delivers the value of 1000 banco thalers at the current rate of
                    exchange, which may amount to somewhat more, somewhat less, or precisely 4000/37 Cologne marks of
                    silver.
                    <br>
                    <br>The daily intercourse among the inhabitants of one and the same locality, and with their nearest
                    neighbors — the daily commerce and exchange — which is not conducted through entries and
                    counter-entries in Banco, but rather by exhibition in natura, that is, through the presentation of
                    the agreed-upon price of goods in the noble metal preferred as the equivalent for all such items,
                    requires coinage: that is, portions of such metal which, as evidence that they indeed possess the
                    properties prescribed by the minting authority, bear the stamp of said authority.
                    <br>
                    <br>The mint master determines and prescribes what shall be regarded as one unit in the use of such
                    coinage, and how many such units shall be struck from a given quantity of noble metal. And when the
                    units upon which the coin is based and those employed in the bank’s reckoning bear the same name —
                    for example, both being called a thaler — then one distinguishes these units, and the accounting
                    conducted according to either, by the addition of the terms in Banco and in Courant; and the word
                    Species always implies an inseparable and inherent reference to the concept of a bank.
                    <br>
                    <br>Naturally, the minting authority — that is, the sovereign — will prescribe but one unit — nay,
                    more precisely, he will only tolerate a single unit: just as, in accordance with sound policing
                    regulations, there must be but one ell for measuring. For to what end should it serve, or what
                    benefit could there be, in having two kinds of units — for instance, two types of thaler — one kind
                    of which yields so and so many pieces per mark, and another kind which yields a different number
                    from the same mark, thereby standing in a definite ratio to one another? What purpose could this
                    serve, save to introduce unnecessary and grievously burdensome complications — nay, confusion?
                    <br>
                    <br>If, in the consideration of any given coinage, one looks solely to the quantity of fine silver
                    contained therein — setting aside all foreign alloy and all other circumstances — then each type of
                    coin possesses a fixed ratio, determined by the weight of the fine silver it contains; and the
                    valuation of such coin according to that ratio is what is called Pari.
                    <br>
                    <br>Yet such valuation or equalization of different coin types according to Pari rarely takes place,
                    whether in the exchange of one variety for another, or in the reduction of accounts expressed in one
                    kind into another. And between Banco and Courant, no Pari exists in the strict sense, because — as
                    has previously been shown — the Banco Thaler and the Species Thaler are not unalterably or wholly
                    identical; in other words, because the Banco Thaler, as a unit of account, cannot be represented
                    immutably by one and the same quantity of precious metal.
                    <br>
                    <br>Apart from the differences inherent in the mixture of precious metal with alloy — both in
                    quality and quantity — numerous other circumstances arise when coin types are compared among one
                    another and when Courant is compared with Banco; most of these are temporal or situational factors —
                    for example, that a certain coin type may, at a particular moment, be more or less serviceable for
                    certain purposes. Therefore, deviations from Pari can in no wise cause surprise.
                    <br>
                    <br>These deviations are diminished, and the price of a given coin type remains more consistent,
                    both in large and small commerce, in proportion to how little the noble metal therein is adulterated
                    with alloy, and in proportion to the extent to which, in the minting process, adequate care is taken
                    to ensure the uniformity or identity of the individual pieces of any given coin type.
                    <br>
                    <br>The coinage stamp is intended solely to render the use of scales, touchstones, and crucibles
                    unnecessary; and in the commerce between nations — wherein it is solely the quantity of noble metal
                    that is considered — the stamp carries weight only insofar as the foreign party places trust in the
                    minting authority whose coin is offered.
                    <br>
                    <br>It is therefore highly advisable to mint principally large-denomination courant coins, even
                    pieces amounting to several marks, since the identity of individual coins is the more easily
                    achieved and preserved the larger they are; and as for small courant coins, in the various
                    gradations of the subdivision of the unit, to mint only so many as are necessary to facilitate minor
                    exchanges: all according to the needs of domestic commerce and the quantity of currency required to
                    sustain such transactions among the inhabitants of the state.
                    <br>
                    <br>Payments of considerable sums in small coinage always have something improper about them —
                    which, to be sure, cannot be outright forbidden — but which may be prevented if the minting
                    authority issues a sufficient quantity of larger denominations, and of small coin — the Scheidemünze
                    — only as much as is absolutely necessary, the need for which may safely be awaited, for when it
                    does arise, it may be quickly and easily remedied.
                    <br>
                    <br>The noble metals cannot be coined without the admixture of a baser and harder metal. This
                    admixture, the entire process of minting, the institutions for coinage, and the employment of
                    requisite personnel together give rise to considerable expenses; and that the minting authority
                    should, by way of indemnification, slightly reduce the quantity of noble metal in a coin whose
                    circulating value is to equal a certain sum — for instance, that a piece bearing the value of 1
                    Courant, i.e. 3/34 of a mark of fine silver, should not contain exactly those 3 parts, but somewhat
                    less — this is not only equitable, but prudent, as a safeguard against melting down.
                    <br>
                    <br>This deduction from intrinsic content — the so-called Schlagschatz — must, however, never be
                    regarded as more than compensation; it must never become a manufacturing profit. The coarser the
                    coin type, the smaller the permissible deduction from intrinsic value; and even for the smallest
                    Scheidemünze, the Schlagschatz must never so exceed the cost of fabrication as to permit
                    unauthorized coining, since with the ease of imitating the stamp, such pieces could be reproduced
                    without being false in metal content.
                    <br>
                    <br>There may, moreover, arise situations in which it is advisable to forgo the Schlagschatz
                    altogether in magnanimity, and to reckon the cost of minting among the general expenses of state,
                    whose reimbursement cannot be effected directly, and perhaps not at all. Such a case occurs when
                    neighboring states, whose subjects engage in frequent and varied commerce with one another, have for
                    years observed a common Münzfuß (coin standard), and have minted to an equivalent specification —
                    and now one of them, in wishing to introduce a previously unrecognized Schlagschatz, would undertake
                    a change in the coin standard. It is certain that the neighboring states would not accept such a
                    change; they would not allow the newly minted coin to pass at par with their own; the subjects would
                    find themselves in confusion; and such manifold inconveniences would arise for the minting
                    authority, and such disorder in daily trade, that the advantage of the Schlagschatz would soon
                    appear trifling — not to mention the many further disadvantages inseparably connected with even the
                    slightest deviation from an established monetary standard.
                    <br>
                    <br>Through meticulous and precise adjustment, Wippen is prevented; through fine and elegant
                    coinage, Rippen is deterred — and likewise forgery. For rarely does an artist stoop to become a
                    deceiver, and rarely is the deceiver an artist. Of these preventative measures, the latter — against
                    Rippen — remains applicable even in the case of Scheidemünze, especially when the smaller
                    denominations are rendered somewhat voluminous through ample alloying; the former — against Wippen —
                    applies only to coarse coinage, and this is why, as stated earlier, it is advisable primarily to
                    mint coarse coinage, and to strike small denominations only in cases of necessity.
                    <br>
                    <br>As it thus lies largely within the power of the minting authority to forestall both these abuses
                    — Wippen and Rippen — and, once they arise, to put a timely end to them upon detection; and since
                    the mint stamp is intended to guarantee the intrinsic content: then, upon the necessity arising to
                    call in coinage so degraded through Wippen and Rippen as to become intolerable, one may rightly
                    raise the question — who is to bear the loss in the replacement of the recalled coinage with new and
                    full-valued pieces: the minting authority, or the holder who delivers the decried coin for exchange?
                    <br>
                    <br>And indeed, in a juridical resolution of this matter, consideration might, in regard to Wippen,
                    lean toward the holder, for Wippen is not visible to the eye, and no one can guard himself against
                    it; whereas in the case of Rippen, the consideration that it is plainly visible may support the side
                    of the minting authority.
                    <br>
                    <br>The present treatise — like the one concerning paper money, which likewise originates from my
                    hand and appears in the 43rd issue of these Staatsanzeigen — has been committed to paper by me with
                    reference to the controversy that has arisen concerning the current coinage and banking operations
                    in Holstein.

                        <h3>My Notes on the above text.</h3>
                        Wippen: A form of coin degradation in which swindlers would file small amounts of precious
                        metal from the edges of coins, reducing their weight without obvious visual change. This
                        affected the intrinsic value of the coin.
                        <br>
                        <br>Rippen: Another method of coin tampering, where material was visibly scraped or shaved from
                        the rim of the coin. This type of debasement was easier to detect than Wippen.
                        <br>
                        <br>Scheidemünze: Small-denomination coins used primarily for everyday transactions. These
                        contained less precious metal and were not intended as stores of value, but rather to facilitate
                        small-scale commerce.
                        <br>
                        <br>Schlagschatz (literally "coinage tax"): The seigniorage or margin retained by the minting
                        authority during the production of coins. This represents the difference between the face value
                        of the coin and its actual metal content, meant to cover production costs—not to yield profit.
                        <br>
                        <br>Gepräge: The imprint or stamp on a coin, identifying its origin and serving as a guarantee
                        of its weight and metal content. It had both a legal and symbolic trust function.
                        <br>
                        <br>Münzherr (minting lord): The sovereign or authority with the right to issue coinage. This
                        could be a king, prince, state, or other territorial ruler. The right to mint was an important
                        expression of sovereignty.
                        <br>
                        <br>Münzfuß (coinage standard): The monetary standard defining the ratio between the coin’s face
                        value and its content of precious metal. Changes to the standard could have major implications
                        for trade and public trust, especially in regions sharing a common standard.
                        <br>
                        <br>Coin recall: The process by which old or degraded coins are withdrawn from circulation and
                        replaced with newly minted coins. This was typically done when coins had become overly debased
                        or lacked public confidence.
                        <br>
                        <br>Staatsanzeigen: A governmental or semi-official journal (common in the German-speaking world
                        in the 18th and 19th centuries) where officials, scholars, and reformers published essays on
                        economic, administrative, or political issues—a kind of public policy forum.
                        <br>
                        <br>Holstein: A duchy under Danish sovereignty during this period, with its own legal and
                        economic administration. Monetary and banking controversies in Holstein are referenced in the
                        text as the immediate context for this essay.
