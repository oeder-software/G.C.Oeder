                </h2>
                I will divide the report of my journey, undertaken by order of His Royal Majesty, through Holland to
                England and France,
                and through Germany to inspect foreign botanical institutions and to compare them with the plan for the
                botanical
                institution intended by His Majesty, which I had the honor of most humbly presenting before my
                departure, into two
                parts. <br><br>
                In the first part, I will provide information about the state of botany among foreign nations, as I have
                been able to
                observe.<br><br>
                In the second part, I will present what I, after the said comparison and continued deeper reflection,
                deem beneficial
                for the greater perfection of my mentioned plan, and thus for the Royal Institution itself.
                To this, I append an annex of opinions expressed in writing by some knowledgeable men regarding my plan,
                in the original
                as well as in copies and translations.<br><br>
                My thoughts regarding the arrangement and construction of the enclosing wall, the greenhouses, and the
                overall local
                layout of the garden will be presented separately after a further inspection of the site and a
                conversation with the
                Royal Court Architect, General Major von Thurah. I therefore most humbly request the necessary
                postponement and
                corresponding instruction for arranging such a conversation.

                <h2>
                    FIRST PART - On Holland

                </h2>

                In Holland, I have visited the academic gardens in Utrecht and Leyden, as well as the medicinal gardens
                in Amsterdam and
                The Hague.<br><br>
                The garden in Utrecht is newly established. It is too small, but otherwise well stocked. The current
                professor, Mr.
                Wachendorff, a wealthy man, contributes a lot from his own fortune. For what the curators of the
                university have
                provided, according to Mr. Wachendorff's report, is by no means sufficient. Thus, the garden will
                deteriorate under
                another professor who neither can nor will spend what Mr. Wachendorff does.<br><br>
                The garden in Leyden is one of the oldest academic gardens and has been one of the most remarkable since
                its founding,
                and still is, although my impression formed from Mr. von Royen's Flora Leydensis has been somewhat
                diminished. It is
                maintained, like the whole university, jointly by the provinces of Holland, West Friesland, and Zeeland.
                By their order,
                plants must be supplied from all Dutch colonies, making it easy to acquire African plants and those from
                both Indies.
                However, the greenhouses seem too small to me, and the gardener, with two helpers for all the work, too
                few. The
                academic holidays, which fall in summer and last for six weeks, are also observed in the garden. Last
                year, when Mr.
                Professor von Royen

                <br><br>
                handed over his botanical professorship to his nephew, it was transferred from the medical faculty to
                the philosophical
                one, yet the garden is still nothing more than a medicinal garden. In Leyden, I met a young man whom the
                Academy of
                Sciences in Saint Petersburg has sent on travels for several years to train as a botanist.
                <br><br>
                The medicinal garden in Amsterdam is the best maintained. It is spacious and equipped with very
                beautiful, large
                greenhouses, and the gardener is provided with eight assistants every day. Among the directors, there
                are always some
                from the large merchants, and currently, one of them is Mr. Cliffort, from whose own garden Mr. Linnaeus
                wrote the
                famous book Hortus Cliffortianus, and the garden naturally does not lack plants from the Dutch colonies.
                A large part of
                the expenses comes from a fee that all doctors, surgeons, apothecaries, and their apprentices and
                journeymen are obliged
                to pay, and the other part is provided by the magistrate. The total expenses amount to about 3000
                rixdollars. Since the
                time of the Commelins, there has been a small library and some volumes of paintings, but neither is
                clearly defined,
                which means they remain fragmentary.


                <br><br>

                I was also surprised that in the many hours I spent in the garden during my stay in Amsterdam, I did not
                see anyone
                there seeking to learn, and thus so many plants bloom only for the gardener. Mr. Burmann, professor of
                botany, also
                complained about the lack of enthusiasts. The gardener, with the prior knowledge of the curators, can
                sell certain
                plants, of which there is a supply, on their account, and when the Royal Garden can be stocked, it may
                be wise to
                acquire plants from the Dutch colonies there, and, according to Mr. Tronchin’s advice, also request the
                magistrate to
                provide assistance in this matter.


                For the medicinal garden in The Hague, Mr. Professor Schwencke began the work last year, and it was
                underway that the
                magistrate should buy the garden he had prepared for this purpose and establish an institution for the
                benefit of the
                local surgeons and apothecaries.<br><br>
                A general remark I would make about all these gardens is that it seems to me the botanists there hold
                too little
                correspondence, being content with what is brought to them from their nation's colonies, and that they
                lack plants from
                the large European, especially the eastern, continent. There is also no provision for botanists to
                correspond without
                incurring losses.<br><br>
                I also do not like that gardeners are allowed to charge money for access to these gardens, and that this
                income

                is considered part of their salary. It is burdensome for many learners and true enthusiasts, and for the
                gardener and
                his people, it is a waste of time when they, for their own benefit, must deal with all the ignorant
                spectators.

                <br><br>
                In economic botany, the Dutch skill and diligence are undeniably worthy of emulation. They make the most
                of their land,
                of which each has, of course, only a small portion. All of Holland looks like a garden. Necessity and
                the desire for
                profit have made them skillful. The efforts of a wise king to encourage his subjects and make their
                industry more
                fruitful through the spread of greater knowledge is a major reason for the promotion of the gardener's
                art. Most of what
                applies in Holland must also apply in Denmark. The winter is not much harsher here, and the atmospheric
                conditions are
                mostly the same.
            </section>
            <section id="chap4">
                <h2>
                    On England
                </h2>
                In England, public institutions have not contributed much to the advancement of botany, but the wealth
                of the
                inhabitants, combined with the natural charm and appeal of country life, has made botany more widespread
                in this country
                than in any other. Just as most travelers prefer the variety in the English landscapes over the
                uniformity in Holland,
                the English taste in gardening also deserves preference over the Dutch. The eye is not restricted to the
                small art of
                dry symmetry in paths, hedges, and parterres, but is instead allowed a free view of nature, which
                pleases in its
                grandeur, making one feel as though they are in the finest part of a beautiful region. One is not
                wearied by the
                colorful florist’s game of insignificant variations of a few flower species, but rather sees truly
                different plants that
                seem to have been produced by nature itself in their locations.

                <br><br>

                The English do not highly value the plants in their gardens that must be forced in greenhouses and by
                artificial
                methods, but rather prefer those that want to grow freely in the open land and air. Their North American
                colonies
                provide them with a great quantity of these, which they gradually try to naturalize in England. They
                especially love
                trees and shrubs, from which they create small forests around their country houses. One can judge how
                widespread this
                taste has already become from the fact that several gardeners around London sustain themselves well from
                large
                plantations, selling hundreds of such open-grown plants, which one seldom sees individually in gardens
                specifically
                designed for that purpose.<br><br>
                I have seen two public botanical gardens. The garden of the Apothecaries' Society in London, located in
                Chelsea, was
                expanded by Hans Sloane through his generosity, but otherwise, I found nothing particularly remarkable
                about this
                institution. The current advantages of the garden are more due to the special diligence and skill of the
                experienced
                gardener Mr. Philip Miller than to the original design of the institution.<br><br>
                The garden in Oxford was founded by a private person in the previous century, and in this century, Jacob
                Sherard, an
                apothecary in London, has improved this foundation. The layout of the garden and the house where the
                professor resides,
                as well as the herbaria belonging to Morison,

                Bobart, Sherard, and Dillenius, are quite beautiful and impressive, but the annual funding does not seem
                very
                substantial. The professor has revenues of 3000 pounds, the gardener has 20 pounds for correspondence
                and plant
                purchases, and all incidental expenses fall on the curators of the Sherard Foundation each time.
                <br><br>

                This Sherard garden actually does not belong to the University of Oxford, but one can also recognize the
                old scholastic
                structure of this university by the fact that, according to their constitution, very little has been
                done for botany,
                chemistry, or anatomy, or other sciences beyond the speculative ones.<br><br>
                In the extensive American colonies, many doctors have settled, among whom there are always some
                herbalists who provide
                more knowledge about the local plants and the plants themselves. In the last year, a physician I know
                returned to
                England after a nine-year stay in Jamaica, Barbados, and Antigua, which share the climate and conditions
                of the
                Caribbean islands, and has noted much more and better than Hans Sloane. Mr. Collinson, about whom there
                is an addition
                in the appendix,

                has a correspondent in Pennsylvania (Collinson himself is a Quaker) whose profession is to collect seeds
                from the local
                plants for enthusiasts in Europe, which will mostly thrive outdoors in Denmark, as I have seen in Mr.
                Collinson's
                garden, or as it was with the Virginian plants at Mr. Gronov's in Leiden.<br><br>
                I would like to briefly mention a small journey I took to the coast of Kent with a learned merchant, Mr.
                Ellis, to
                conduct some investigations on sea products, which have until recently been regarded as plants. Our
                observations have
                confirmed that these disputed bodies are animal products and habitats of animals. Mr. Ellis will now
                likely be finished
                with his book that he intended to write on this subject. On my part, I will keep these matters in mind
                while in Norway.

                <h2>
                    On France.
                </h2>


                The Royal Botanical Garden in Paris is, according to its original foundation, also known as a garden for
                medicinal
                plants. It was established under Louis XIII, and Gui de la Brosse, who made the initial





                proposal for it and became its first professor, had his memoirs printed for the king, Richelieu, and
                other ministers,
                along with the king's patent. Under Louis XIV, professorships in chemistry and anatomy were also created
                for the garden,
                as the institutions in the old Parisian university, just as I have mentioned regarding the English
                universities, are
                quite poor in the medical faculty. However, all these professors have their appointments issued as
                professors of botany.
                The total expenditure for the current institution is no more than 20,000 livres, of which the Intendant
                du Jardin du Roy
                receives 6,000, the first professor of botany 1,500, and the second 1,200, while the gardener gets
                2,800, which he must
                use to pay the wages of all the workers. A draftsman is also employed, and currently, it is a women’s
                room. In the
                garden, there is also the Cabinet du Roy, along with a guard and demonstrator. The space is larger than
                necessary and is
                merely a burden for the gardener. The greenhouses are old and spacious. There is no library associated
                with the garden,
                but there are large collections of dried herbs, especially from Tournefort's Levantine journey, and in
                the Royal
                Library, there is a collection of 60 volumes of painted plants that has no equal,

                which was already initiated in the early part of the last century by Gaston d'Orleans.

                <br><br>
                For the past four or five years, the King of France has had a botanical garden established in Trianon
                for his personal
                pleasure, which he frequently visits to view the plants. The greenhouse is the finest of its kind that I
                have seen. The
                gardener has orders to procure everything possible and have it brought in from other countries, whatever
                can be sourced.
                Similarly, the Duc d'Ayen, eldest son of the Duc de Noailles, has established a similar garden in St.
                Germain, his
                governorship, around the same time for his pleasure. This garden deserves precedence over that of
                Trianon in several
                respects, particularly the arboretum, which contains everything that can be considered beautiful in this
                regard and
                provides a captivating view with many foreign trees growing in the open air.<br><br>
                In this garden, the skilled physician Mr. le Monnier, a practitioner and hospital doctor in St. Germain,
                provides
                valuable service to the Duke.

                Furthermore, near the park in Courbevoie, Mr. de Bombarde has a similar garden and is particularly
                focused on the
                cultivation of foreign plants. Mr. du Hamel, Inspecteur General de la Marine, is also a lover of botany
                and a practical
                botanist.

                <br><br>
                Since the French also have large colonies in America, and for a long time there have been great
                botanists in France,
                with the two brothers, Msr. de Jussieu, having grown old in the field of botany and having had the
                opportunity to train
                many good students, who are now spread across various parts of France and also in America, and since the
                transportation
                of plants is promoted as best as possible by the government, with all the aforementioned gardens
                supporting one another,
                and each enthusiast always receiving something special from their correspondents, it is clear that these
                gardens
                collectively contain a larger number of different plants than in any other country. Every year, a
                significant number of
                new plants arrive from America, which had not previously been seen in Europe; for example, the brother
                of the
                aforementioned Msr. de Jussieu sends many plants from Peru from time to time. From Senegal, a student of
                Bernard de
                Jussieu, after a four-year stay, has brought various plants in good seeds, as well as valuable
                information

                from this little-explored part of Africa. Canada supplies Siberian and Norwegian plants, as clear
                evidence that the
                conclusion regarding common plants between countries is generally well-founded. <br><br>
                Now, Mr. du Hamel's book on trees and shrubs that can be grown in the open in France is likely
                published. Mr. du Hamel
                plants on his estates, based on the information he receives from his correspondents along with the
                plants themselves
                from America, each on the spots where the soil and location are most favorable, thereby turning his
                entire estate into a
                garden. Mr. du Hamel is well-known as a practical botanist and insightful landowner from various
                memoirs, particularly
                from Traité sur l'agriculture. I wish Denmark had many such men. France would have more of them if the
                establishment at
                Jardin du Roy were expanded, and if such encouragement inspired more people like Mr. du Hamel, who act
                out of passion
                and personal initiative.

                <h2>
                    On Germany
                </h2>

                I have visited three gardens in Germany. In the Margrave's garden


                in Karlsruhe, one can still see the remnants of the large collection of foreign plants that the previous
                Margrave had
                gathered. The current Margrave does not continue this project on the same scale, likely because it
                exceeds his financial
                means. However, the most beautiful orangerie, possibly the finest outside of Italy, still remains there.
                <br><br>
                The Göttingen garden, where I studied botany under Mr. von Haller, owes its supply of plants that can be
                grown from
                seeds to Mr. von Haller’s extensive correspondence. However, it has always been lacking in shrubs. There
                were
                shortcomings in its initial setup, and with the minimal resources allocated to it, it is bound to
                deteriorate.<br><br>
                The Helmstedt garden is regarded as one of the most significant in Germany. Mr. von Sprekelsen of
                Hamburg enriched it
                with the collection of foreign plants from his own garden. However, the greenhouses appeared faulty to
                me, and overall,
                I noticed nothing particularly remarkable about the establishment.
                <br><br>
                All academic gardens in Germany are, as such, solely dedicated to a single purpose within botany,
                serving merely as
                medicinal gardens. As such, they do not justify or reward a large investment, and in general, the
                resources allocated to
                the German academies are not generous. Additionally, overland transportation makes


                it difficult and costly to assemble a substantial collection of foreign plants. From these
                circumstances, it becomes
                clear that one should not expect to find well-supplied botanical gardens in Germany. What wealthy
                enthusiasts do here
                and there is incidental and not of great significance to botany overall.<br><br>
                At the otherwise renowned University of Halle, there has so far been no academic garden; however, I have
                recently heard
                that the King of Prussia intends to establish one there.
                <br><br>


                I previously visited the botanical garden in Berlin during my stay there. It is unnecessarily large, and
                since it is far
                from the city, it cannot be visited without considerable time loss. I am not aware that it is used for
                anything other
                than medicinal purposes, even though it is under the Academy of Sciences. In Stuttgart lives a man named
                Martini, who
                accompanied Mr. Gmelin in Siberia and now cultivates most of the plants brought from there in Stuttgart.
                Since Mr.
                Gmelin, due to illness, is unable to continue working, it is to be feared that Flora Sibirica, the fruit
                of a nine-year
                journey, will not be completed. The aforementioned Martini still has duplicates of dried herbs, and from
                these,

                he could form a herbarium worthy of being preserved in a public botanical library, so that the memory of
                these Siberian
                plants does not completely fade.
                <br><br>
                Now I will conclude the first part of my most humble report with the following remarks.<br><br>
                All these botanical institutions in the various countries I have mentioned are based on the notions that
                have only
                recently emerged about botany in the world, according to which it is regarded as part of the medical
                science. Thus, it
                has almost exclusively been doctors who have pursued botany, and those physicians engaged with patients
                have left botany
                to those removed from the bedside and the opportunity for practical experience. As a result, far from
                everything that
                could be done with this narrow view of botany has been accomplished. Furthermore, it is far from proven
                that plants
                exist solely to serve humans directly, especially as medicinal remedies. Therefore, it is impossible for
                a medical
                botanist to give a satisfactory answer to the frequent question: What is the use of knowing 6,000 herbs
                if one only
                knows how to utilize at most 500 of them? Thus, the emptiness of botany under this conception is
                revealed. Consequently,
                botany has been viewed as a relatively useless science by those who promote the sciences, and botanists
                have been
                considered somewhat impractical individuals. The economic side of botany has been left to empirical
                practitioners, who
                proceed without scientific knowledge or reasoning, treating it as a mere craft.
                <br><br>
                With such incomplete concepts, all botanical institutions have also remained incomplete, and it is
                easier to establish
                entirely new institutions than to reform an already existing, albeit outdated, system. A serious issue
                with these older
                institutions is that even if the original founders provided adequately for the preservation of the
                foundation according
                to their ideas, any institution based on cash funds will lose value over time due to the changing value
                of precious
                metals.
