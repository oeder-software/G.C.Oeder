                    Concerning the special survey of the Vogtei Stuhr.
                </h3>

                With regard to the nature of the special surveys, I refer to the description provided on pages 8–10 and
                19–22 of this volume of the journal.
                <br>
                <br>Thus far, the special surveys of the Vogteien have been delayed by other urgent tasks carried out by
                the geodetists, especially the mapping of the sea coast from the border between East Frisia and Jever to
                the border between Landwürsten and the Hamburg district of Ritzebüttel.
                <br>
                <br>However, these coastal operations—see page 13—will be completed this summer through the surveying of
                the Weser River from Blexer Hörne upstream.
                <br>
                <br>Thereafter, the work on the special surveys of the Vogteien will proceed more swiftly, and next in
                line will be the district of Neuenburg, already surveyed at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, and
                consisting of the two parishes of Bockhorn and Zetel.
                <br>
                <br>At present, I submit the following:
                <br>
                <br>Overview of the Vogtei Stuhr.
                <br>This entire Vogtei consists of the single parish of Stuhr, which comprises the following localities:
                Stuhrreihe, Varel, Moordeich, Grolland, Kuhlen, Kladdingen, Stuhrbaum, Brinkumer Moor, Obernheide,
                Blocken, and Barken. The most substantial of these settlements is Stuhrreihe, which serves as the parish
                village and consists of farms all arranged along a single street or line; next in size are Moordeich and
                Varel. The remaining settlements are of lesser importance, and Kuhlen consists of only a single farm.
                <br>
                <br>To the west, the Vogtei borders—via the village of Varel—on the Hausvogtei of Delmenhorst, though
                without a precisely defined boundary line. To the east, it borders—through the villages of Grolland and
                Kuhlen, and partly through Kladdingen—on the small embanked river known as the Ochtum, across which
                there is a bridge at the watchtower, traversed by the main highway and postal road. There is also a
                ferry at Kuhlen, and on the opposite side lies the territory of Stade-Bremen. To the north, it
                borders—via the villages of Varel, Moordeich, Grolland, and Kladdingen—on the urban parish of Huchting,
                whose parish village Kirchhuchting lies between Varel and Grolland and is partially enclosed. To the
                south, it borders—through the villages of Stuhrbaum, Brinkumer Moor, Obernheide, Blocken, and Barken—on
                the Electoral Hanoverian districts of Sieke and Harpstedt.
                <br>
                <br>The Stuhr Church is distant:
                <br>From Oldenburg – 120,726 Rhineland feet
                <br>Delmengory – 26,834 – | –
                <br>Ansgarii Tower in Bremen – 21,013 – | –
                <br>Watchtower – 14,661 – | –
                <br>Huchting – 9,184 – | –
                <br>Between the Watchtower and Ansgarii Tower the distance is 9,600 – | –
                <br>
                <br>A small stream originating from Harpstedt, called the Vareler Beecke, flows past Blocken and Barken,
                through the village of Varel towards Varelgrav, where there is a bridge over which the aforementioned
                land and post road from the Watchtower through the parish of Huchting runs.
                <br>
                <br>The territorial boundary has been adjusted all around in agreement with the neighbors, except on the
                side of Huchting, where a certain stretch called Dovemoor remains disputed.
                <br>
                <br>The entire Vogtei contains an area of 262,901,786 square feet by Rhineland measurements. Assuming
                geographic miles, 15 to a degree of the equator, at 23,626 Rhineland feet per mile, such a square mile
                contains 558,187,876 square feet; assuming the mile to be 24,000 feet, such a square mile contains 576
                million square feet. Therefore, the Vogtei Stuhr comprises 0.4709 square miles of the first kind, and
                0.4545 square miles of the second kind.
                <br>
                <br>Of this area of 262,901,785 square feet:
                <br>11,629,322 are farmyards and gardens,
                <br>63,171,896 plowland,
                <br>81,321,950 uncultivated land, thus a total of 181,588,835 cultivated land, of which 106,787,614 are
                meadows and pastures.
                <br>Included under the uncultivated land are:
                <br>3,120,000 the aforementioned disputed so-called Dovemoor
                <br>17,427,600 the so-called Vareler Gemeinheit,
                <br>after deducting these remains: 63,885,350 for uncultivated land.
                <br>
                <br>The Rhineland foot relates to the Oldenburg foot as 18 to 17, and the squares of these numbers are
                324 and 289, so that 289 square Rhineland feet equal 324 square Oldenburg feet; one Jück of the new
                measure contains 51,840 square Oldenburg feet, thus one Jück of the new measure contains 46,240 square
                Rhineland feet.
                <br>
                <br>Consequently, the area of the entire Vogtei is large:
                <br>5,686.3 Jück
                <br>the cultivated land: 3,927.8
                <br>farmyards and gardens: 251.5
                <br>plowland: 1,366.2
                <br>meadows and pasture land: 2,310
                <br>uncultivated land: 1,758.5
                <br>the Vareler Gemeinheit: 376.9
                <br>uncultivated land excluding this Gemeinheit: 1,381.6
                <br>the disputed Dovemoor: 67.5
                <br>
                <br>The woodlands are insignificant, planted near houses, and are therefore included under the area of
                farmyards.
                <br>
                <br>There has been consideration of partitioning the Vareler Gemeinheit, which, except for a small heath
                area, consists of usable green land; however, this has not yet been implemented.
                <br>
                <br>The Dovemoor is poor arable land, mostly overrun by heath.
                <br>
                <br>According to inquiries made during the survey, the population in the year 1785 was 1,204 people, of
                whom 111 were absent.
                <br>
                <br>The livestock consisted of 206 horses, 871 head of horned cattle, 155 pigs, and 288 sheep.
                <br>
                <br>The main trades are meadow cultivation and livestock breeding. All of Grolland and generally the
                land along the Ochtum is marshland. To the nearby city of Bremen, fat cattle, milk, butter, and hay are
                sold, and many inhabitants of the city rent land for grazing livestock. Among the 11 absentees are some
                Dutch merchants, and among the young people, undoubtedly many serve and work as day laborers in Bremen.
                <br>
                <br>In this Vogtei there are:
                <br>27 full farms, of which 7 are managed outside the district,
                <br>7 half farms, of which 2 are managed outside the district,
                <br>10 rural cotter’s farms,
                <br>19 small cotter’s farms,
                <br>and many henhouses, whose residents largely earn their daily wages in the nearby city of Bremen.
                <br>
                <br>Some of the farms are quite considerable. For example, farm no. 1 in the village of Grolland,
                according to the land register, is 97 Jück in size, and was redeemed from bankruptcy several years ago
                for 14,000 Reichsthaler.
                <br>The buildings insured in the fire fund number 323, among which 204 are inhabited, and 119 are barns
                and sheds. The insured value of these amounted to the sum of 74,180 Reichsthaler at the end of the year
                1788.
                <br>There is little free land.
                <br>Due to the road leading through this Vogtei to foreign countries, a toll has been established.
                <br>The parish has a windmill, which is a leased property.
                <br>
                <br>On the Vareler Beecke, on a free farmstead, there is a mill which formerly was a copper mill and is
                now a fulling mill.
                <br>
                <br>On page 487, line 7: At Steinhaufer Mühle, instead of 40,570 it should read 37,815, and instead of
                101,839 it should read 99,085, from which the following corrections follow: Page 201, at the word
                Steinhaufen, instead of 21,516 it should be 21,870. Page 202, at the thrice occurring word Steinhaufen,
                instead of 26,148 it should be 22,845, instead of 10,914 it should be 9,071, instead of 10,447 it should
                be 13,498.
                <br>
                <br>January 28, 1789.
                <br>G. C. v. Oeder.
