                <br> The occasion is given me by a writing which came to my attention but three days ago, entitled:
                Further Elucidation and Confirmation of the Proposals Already Printed in the Spring of 1780 for the
                Maintenance and Improvement of the Bremen Widow's Care Institution: by the Göttingen Co-Participants in
                this Fund. Published in Göttingen, by Rosenbusch, in November 1780.
                <br>
                <br>On page 22 thereof, a copy received from Delmenhorst of an expert opinion sent to the Bremen
                administration is ascribed to me and is received with much approval. However, this honour does not
                belong to me, but to my friend, Mr. Chamberlain von Hendorf, who—as a member of the Bremen Widow's Care
                Institution—composed the mentioned treatise as a vote, in his own name and that of the local
                co-participants, and communicated it to the brethren in Delmenhorst.
                <br>
                <br>In the meantime, Mr. v. H. and I are in complete agreement on the matter; and it will not be
                unwelcome to the Göttingen co-participants—since in their initial writing they did me the honour of also
                referring to me—to now also have my opinion… I merely add that these essays, although now only just
                having received their official form, were already composed before I had yet seen the aforementioned
                proposals from the gentlemen in Göttingen from February 1780—prompted by my conversation with my friend
                concerning the vote he was to deliver.

                <h3>A.

                </h3>
                <h4> Reflections on the State of the Bremen Widow's Fund, as it stood at the Michaelmas term 1779.
                </h4>Data:
                <br>Available capital: 157,300 Rixdollars.
                <br>Number of widows: 117, on average 52 years old.
                <br>
                <br>Their pension sum: 7,925 Rixdollars semi-annually; thus, on average, 67 Rixdollars, 52 12/13
                shillings,
                or in decimal terms: 67.735 Rixdollars semi-annually, the logarithm of which is 1.8308131.
                <br>
                <br>Married couples: 378 in number. The men: 52 years old on average; the women: 44 years. The total of
                the contingent pensions assigned to these women: 55,100 Rixdollars annually, or 27,550 Rixdollars
                semi-annually. Thus, on average: 72 Rixdollars, 63 13/14 shillings, or in decimal terms: 72.8879
                Rixdollars semi-annually, the logarithm of which is 1.8626554.
                <br>
                <br>The semi-annual contribution for a 100 Rixdollar annual, or 50 semi-annual, contingent pension is 7½
                Rixdollars; thus, for a 72.8879 Rixdollar semi-annual contingent pension, the semi-annual contribution
                is the number corresponding to the logarithm 1.0387467, namely 10.92315 Rixdollars.
                <br>
                <br>The interest rate is said to be 4½ percent. I do not know whether the interest is collected only
                once annually for the whole year, or semi-annually. I shall assume the latter, thus taking the interest
                rate as 2.25 percent semi-annually, so that 1 in capital becomes 1.0225, whose logarithm is 0.0096633.
                However, if the interest is collected only once for the whole year, the income of the fund is thereby
                somewhat reduced, and its debit or deficit increased.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>Summary Calculation:</h4>

                <br>The price of a life annuity, or valor existentiae solitariae, for a 52-year-old person is 10.3489
                Rixdollars for every single Rixdollar of annual pension.
                <br>
                <br>The annuity price for the time of their cohabitation, or valor coexistentiae, of a 44-year-old and a
                52-year-old person, is 8.2131 Rixdollars for every Rixdollar of annual pension — or also: each single
                Rixdollar of annual contribution paid by such a couple during their cohabitation is worth 8.2131
                Rixdollars.
                <br>
                <br>The contingent pension price, or valor existentiae of the 44-year-old person post obitum of the
                52-year-old person, is 3.7164 Rixdollars per each Rixdollar of contingent annual pension.
                <br>
                <br>Thus, if the 15,850 Rixdollars — the annual pension amount for the currently existing 117 widows —
                is multiplied by 10.3489, one obtains the sum of 164,030 Rixdollars: the risk associated with these 117
                widows.
                <br>
                <br>The total amount of contingent pensions insured for the 378 women still living with their husbands —
                55,100 Rixdollars annually — multiplied by 3.7164, gives 204,774 Rixdollars: the risk associated with
                these 378 women.
                <br>
                <br>The annual contribution required of each of the 378 men is 21.8663 Rixdollars; multiplied by 8.2131,
                this gives 179.59 Rixdollars — the value of the contributions expected from each of these men through
                the bank. This sum, 179.59, multiplied by 378, results in 67,885 Rixdollars: the total expected value of
                contributions.
                <br>
                <br>The fund must cover:
                <br>Risk associated with 117 actual widows: .......... 164,030 Rdlr.
                <br>Risk associated with 378 wives: .................. 204,774 Rdlr.
                <br>Total: ........................................... 368,804 Rdlr.
                <br>
                <br>The fund has:
                <br>Existing capital: ................................ 157,300 Rdlr.
                <br>Expected contributions: .......................... 67,885 Rdlr.
                <br>Total: .......................................... 225,185 Rdlr.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>Subtracting available means (225,185 Rdlr.) from the required coverage (368,804 Rdlr.) Leaves a cash
                deficit of: 143,619 Rixdollars
                <br>
                <br>Thus, if all 378 couples were to withdraw completely and leave the present fund to the 117 widows,
                this fund would still not suffice to grant them their full pension to the end of life.
                <br>
                <br>If one intends to manage with 225,185 Rixdollars to the end — that is, without increasing the
                contributions — and wishes to afford both current and future widows equal rights, then both pensions
                must be reduced in the proportion of 368,804 to 225,185, i.e., 100:61.058. Thus, instead of 50
                Rixdollars, only 30.529 Rixdollars would be paid.
                <br>
                <br>Should the 117 present widows nonetheless retain 35 Rixdollars instead of 50, then the risk
                associated with them would be:
                35/50. 15850. 10,3489=114811 Rthlr. This, deducted from the fund’s assets, namely 225,185 Rixdollars,
                leaves 110,371 Rixdollars for the 378 women; that is, 291.917 Rixdollars per woman. This amount would
                support an annual widow’s pension of 78.567 Rixdollars.
                <br>
                <br>However, a pension of 145.778 Rixdollars annually has been promised to them: thus they could receive
                only 26.948 Rixdollars instead of 50.
                <br>
                <br>Should the women, as future widows, nevertheless also receive 35 Rixdollars instead of 50, then the
                risk associated with them would be:
                50/35 ×55,100×3.7164=143,340 Rdlr.
                <br>
                <br>The combined risk:
                114,811+143,340=258,151 Rdlr.
                exceeds the available capital of 225,185 Rixdollars by 32,966 Rixdollars, which would need to be raised
                through an increase in contributions. This increase would have to occur in the ratio:
                67,885:(67,885+32,966), or 100:148.55
                <br>
                <br>My final opinion is thus the following: While maintaining the current contribution rates, pensions
                for both the already existing and the expected widows must be reduced from 100 to 60, and the necessary
                administrative costs are to be covered from the institution’s fund.
                Were the interest rate not 2 1/4 percent but only 2 %, then the reduction of pensions would need to be
                made in the ratio: 50:28.945 instead of the previously calculated 50:30.529.

                <h3>B.</h3>
                <h4>Elaborate Calculation</h4>

                <br>If one wishes to see how the state of the fund would evolve from term to term, should everything
                continue as it has thus far, the procedure is as follows:
                <br>
                <br>One assumes — in order to calculate precisely and without fractions — instead of 117 widows and 378
                couples, 11700 widows and 37800 couples, and correspondingly cuts off the two final digits in the
                results.
                <br>
                <br>The 11700 widows die off in the following sequence: 11326, 10953, 10580, 10206, 9833, 9460, 9036,
                8713, 8339, 7966, 7551, 7136, 6721, 6306, 5892, 5477, 5062, 4647, 4273, 3900, 3527, 3195, 2803, 2572,
                2282, 2033, 1784, 1535, 1328, 1162, 996, 830, 705, 581, 498, 415, 332, 249, 208, 166, 125, 83, 41 — so
                that after one year, 11326 remain, after two years 10953, and so forth.
                <br>
                <br>From the 37800 couples, widows emerge and then die off again in the following sequence: 1182, 2316,
                3389, 4408, 5369, 6351, 7102, 7866, 8566, 9204, 10109, 10483, 11018, 11483, 11878, 12203, 12459, 12644,
                12621, 12527, 12082, 12072, 11538, 11461, 10728, 10110, 9537, 8983, 8280, 7614, 6896, 6292, 5647, 5088,
                4498, 3991, 3397, 2994, 2575, 2194, 1837, 1554, 1306, 1092, 874, 655, 547, 437, 328, 224, 114 — so that
                after one year there are 1182 widows, after two years 2316, etc.
                <br>
                <br>The 37800 couples die off in the following sequence: 35853, 33955, 32008, 30115, 28280, 26499,
                24689, 22942, 21258, 19637, 18398, 16392, 14874, 13426, 12047, 10739, 9500, 8321, 7262, 6264, 5213,
                4534, 3975, 3459, 2959, 2600, 2126, 1716, 1287, 1078, 950, 832, 726, 626, 521, 453, 397, 295, 260, 212,
                171, 128, 100, 80, 64, 48, 36, 26, 20, 14, 9, 6, 5
                <br>
                <br>Since the terms are semi-annual, one inserts the arithmetical means between these values: Between
                11700 and 11326 one inserts 11513; between 11326 and 10953 one inserts 11139, and so on.
                <br>
                <br>Logarithms are used in the calculation, as otherwise it would be too laborious.
                <br>
                <br>As a sample, I will set down the beginning for a few terms.

                <i> <br>Senator and Chamberlain Kritter thanks, in the name of the Göttingen gentlemen co-participants
                    in
                    the Bremen Widows’ Fund, Mr. Oeder for his willingness to provide such a thorough opinion on the
                    fund;
                    and he hopes that at long last the gentlemen co-participants will open their eyes and accept sound
                    advice before the damage becomes irreparable. The result of this report, from a knowledgeable and
                    impartial man, which coincides almost to the letter with that of Kritter’s own, must surely carry
                    some
                    weight among reasonable men. We must therefore deduct 40 percent from the pensions, if we do not
                    wish to
                    defraud the future widows.
                    <br>Kr.</i>
