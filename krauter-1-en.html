          Introduction to
          <br />the Knowledge <br />of Herbs.

          <br /><br />First section.
        </h2>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 1.</h3>
        The science of the plant kingdom naturally divides into three parts,
        or just as many distinct sciences. The benefit it is meant to provide
        is the driving force and ultimate goal behind the effort we invest in
        it, and this benefit arises from investigations into the relationships
        between plants and human needs. The desire to explore the effects of
        nature may drive the philosopher, while the wish to learn about nature
        in the cultivation of plants should encourage the rational farmer and
        gardener to investigate nature’s processes in the production,
        preservation, and reproduction of its plants. In all these
        investigations, one must assume that each plant, whose properties one
        wishes to describe and explain, is already known to some extent by the
        person one intends to serve, so that he knows what is being discussed.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 2.</h3>
        To this final part of the entirety of human knowledge of the plant
        kingdom serves the present introduction, as well as this particular
        science—botany in itself, or fundamental botany (Botanica pura)—in
        contrast to the knowledge of herbs applied to human purposes (Botanica
        applicata) and to the study of the organization and life of plants
        (Physiologia Plantarum). It enables us to recognize all and every herb
        through their immediate impressions on our senses, in the easiest
        possible way, to the extent that is sufficient to distinguish each one
        from all others.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 3.</h3>
        And does it truly require so much that one can make it into a distinct
        science? There are certainly many who ask this question or feel
        inclined to do so. To satisfy them—and in general, to provide all who
        intend to make use of this introduction with a correct understanding
        of the nature and foundations of the science to be presented—this
        question shall be answered explicitly and thoroughly.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 4.</h3>
        When we first become acquainted with the things that surround us in
        nature,we usually—at least in the years of our childhood, when we have
        so much to learn—form a certain notion of them in our memorywithout
        developing this notion in detail:we collect images, not descriptions,
        in our memory.These descriptions require some effort from us when we
        are to construct them,and we also rarely have occasion to do so,for
        the things with which most people are occupiedare so immediately
        accessible to the sensesthat they can easily form an image of
        them.Thus, we need nothing more than to provide an opportunityfor each
        person to recall the image of a thingthat he has previously
        formed.This opportunity is given by the name of the thing,which
        presupposes a prior concept of it,without contributing anything to the
        original formation of this conceptand without making any wiser the one
        who lacks the presupposed understanding.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 5.</h3>
        These undeveloped images that we form of natural bodiesare not the
        same for all people, except perhaps the images of the simplest
        substances.When it comes to more complex things,no one is likely to
        imprint such complete images of them in their memorythat many
        properties would not inevitably be left out:one person will thus
        include more, another less,one will incorporate these properties,
        another different ones.As long as the discussion concerns things that
        frequently occurand whose names are often heard,the differences in the
        images that I and another person have formed of the same thing matter
        little;we will always, under the same name, refer to the same object.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§ . 6.</h3>
        But if the discussion is about things that rarely occur, so that one
        may have formed only a fleeting image of them and seldom has the
        opportunity to renew it through new sensory impressions, what do we do
        then if the person I wish to speak with about it has forgotten the
        name of the thing or no longer remembers the object that bears the
        name, and it is not readily available in nature? Even if I describe as
        accurately as possible the image I have in mind, there is still no
        sufficient reason for the other person to be certain that we truly
        mean one and the same thing. His image may not share a single feature
        with mine, or it may lack precisely those characteristics that truly
        define the object.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 7.</h3>
        The number of herbs is large, their structure is manifoldly
        complex,and knowledge of them is little spread.If one were to become
        familiar with herbs in the same manneras a child learns to know the
        things it sees around it—namely by having each herb shown and its name
        told—how difficult would it not be to acquire such knowledge?How
        uncertain would such knowledge be,when either the image or the name,
        one or the other,among so many herbs, could so easily be lost from
        memory,and when one cannot always have a teacher at hand?Even if the
        teacher is present,how should one then proceed,if the herbs themselves
        are not available in nature,so the teacher could show them again and
        repeat their names?If, in their absence, he tries to help his student
        with a description,what good will that do, if neither the teacher has
        learned to describe,nor the student to understand a description?For it
        is so difficult, among the great number and diverse structures of
        plants,to identify exactly what distinguishes each one,and to avoid
        confusing one with another.
        <br />If the teacher himself then also loses his memory,if the one
        writing about herbs assumes they are already known,yet his student,
        who has learned of them only through sight,frequently errs—as is
        natural in matters of memory—if this student then becomes a teacher
        himself,if errors are thus passed down through generations,and each
        new hand that receives them merely adds more,if at some point the
        science falls completely into neglect,but is later revived by new
        enthusiasts—will they then be able to benefit from the work of former
        writers?Will they be able to understand them,no matter how much they
        long to make use of past experiences?Or will they rather have to start
        entirely anew? <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 8.</h3>
        Indeed, the history of science shows usthat this is exactly how it has
        happened;the surviving writings of the ancientsare as good as lost to
        us,because they are incomprehensible,and thus the experience of so
        many ages is lost as well.
        <br />Should not thosewho acquire knowledge of herbs in the
        mannerstill common in pharmacies todaybe convincedthat this method is
        not entirely solid?Should not thosewho in our time write books about
        plants,without first and foremost either describing them thoroughly
        themselvesor using so simple a methodas merely citing their place in a
        botanist’s book,should not such writers be provento be gravely
        mistakenif they believe they are serving posterity,when already the
        present generation cannot understand them? <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 9.</h3>
        The science to which this introduction is intended to serve teaches
        how one should deal with herbs so that at all times and in all places
        one may unquestionably know which herbs are meant. This is a service
        that might well incline one to grant this fortunate invention of more
        recent times the status of a science.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 10.</h3>
        The method that this science employsconsists of the following:For each
        plant, those properties are selectedby which it is distinguished from
        all others.At the same time, a specific way of observing plants is
        agreed upon,so that the person to whom they are indicatedis guided to
        the very same characteristics.Thus, when he receives a plant,he can
        infer from the presence of the indicated propertiesthat the plant in
        his handsis indeed the one that was meant.
        <br />These selected properties,in which the distinction between a
        plantand all others chiefly lies,are collectively called the character
        of a plant. <br />It is hardly possible to describe any plantin such a
        way that one could fully imagine itbefore actually seeing it.The
        descriptions that one would attempt for this purposewould be tedious
        and,due to the sheer number of plantsthat would all have to be
        described in this way,unbearably lengthy.What use would a verbal image
        of a plant be to me,even if it were possible to create such an image
        through words,if the plant in nature were never to come into my
        hands,or only after a long time?As long as the information provided –
        the character –is sufficient for me to recognize the indicated
        plant,even from just a few properties,the moment I come across it,then
        my need is fully met.

        <br /><br />

        <h3>§. 11.</h3>
        If one is to infer from the presence of a plant’s specified
        propertiesthat the plant in nature is indeedthe same as the one
        described in the record,then it must be assumedthat these specified
        propertiesare truly found only in this particular plantmentioned in
        the record,and in no other in the entire plant kingdom—or if not in
        each one individually,then at least not collectively in any other.
        <br />To achieve such certaintyabout all and every plant,it is
        necessarythat all and every one be comparedwith all others:the already
        known plants with one another,and the newly discovered ones dailywith
        those known beforehand.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 12.</h3>
        This is a task that is not for everyone, but requires its own
        specialist, who undertakes it for the benefit of others, those who
        work with certain herbs whose identification is indispensable to them,
        but who otherwise have nothing to do with the rest of the plants.

        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 13.</h3>
        The botanist records his work in a register,where he lists the herbs
        of a country, a garden,or the entire plant kingdom,by specifying the
        distinguishing characteristicsfound for each herb.
        <br />
        This register becomes usefulthrough the order in which it is
        arranged,which must enable anyone,with minimal effort,to find the herb
        they are interested in. <br />The establishment of such an
        orderrequires thought and skill,which, in time,will be more easily
        understoodthan immediately at present.
        <h3>§. 14.</h3>
        Here, then, we have everything that belongs to the concept of a
        science— a collection of knowledge, which, through its principles and
        objects, are interconnected, and which requires a dedicated specialist
        for its investigation, expansion, and presentation.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>§. 15.</h3>
        One can benefit from this science,just as from all sciencesthat assist
        the primary discipline one pursues,without necessarily engaging in it
        fully.
        <br />
        Each person learns as many herbs as are necessary,useful, and
        agreeable to him,depending on his profession, time, and opportunity.
        <br />
        However, the herbs he wishes to know,he must learn to identify
        reliablyfrom the botanist,and thus acquaint himselfwith the botanist’s
        language,the method of observing plants,and the structure of the
        botanical register.

        <h2>Second section.</h2>
        <h3>§ . 16.</h3>
        When an enthusiast embarks on the pathto knowledge of the plant
        kingdom,a general overview of this realm is just as necessarybefore he
        can proceed with benefitto a more detailed examination of individual
        species,as knowing the borders and main divisions of a countryis in
        geography.
        <br />This overview should be provided by his guide, the botanist,who
        should lead himbut still allow him to walk on his ownand observe his
        surroundings along the way. <br />Upon his first entry into the plant
        kingdom,he will immediately noticecertain major divisions and classes
        of herbs,which nature has made as recognizableas the main classes in
        the animal kingdom,and which are fundamentally based ona unique
        structure in the entire organiccomposition of vegetative bodies.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <h3>§. 17.</h3>
        When he compares the colorful flowers of the meadowwith the grass
        growing among them and with the grain,he immediately noticesthat the
        difference in color is the least significant.
        <br />The flowers surround the young fruitalong with its reproductive
        organs from all sides,so that the lower edge of the flower,where it is
        attached, forms a wreath,in the center of which the fruit is
        fitted—either with its lower end,so that its entire body is enveloped
        by the flower,or with its upper end,so that it carries the flower.This
        difference in position is indicated by the expressions"flower around
        the fruit" and "flower on the fruit." <br />
        In grasses, however, the fruit is found between two small leaves or
        husks,and in many grass-like plants,only under a single leaf,with many
        of these arranged in overlapping scales. <br />Additionally, the
        entire growth structure of grassesis distinguished by their straight,
        undivided stalk,which in true grasses has joints,and by their narrow,
        elongated, pointed leaves,composed of parallel fibers,which enclose
        the stalk with a sheath at the base. <br />In plants that bear
        flowers,the stems and leaves, by contrast, are entirely distinct.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 18</h3>
        When he compares the fruit trees of the gardenswith the trees in the
        forests,he notices in a large number of the lattera special type of
        flowers,which are found beneath scale-like small leaves,lying along
        the length of a common axisand forming a catkin (Amentum, Julus).
        <br />
        Among these, he especially observes the cones (Conus),which have hard
        and woody scales,covering the seeds that lie between them.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§ . 19.</h3>
        Our lands bear no plants of the palm genus (Palmæ),but they are known
        from travel descriptions and engravings.
        <br />These plants have a simple trunk,which only carries leaves with
        a parallel-fibrous texture at its top.The lower part of the leaves
        remains attached to the trunk,even when the rest of the leaf withers
        and falls off,thereby enlarging the trunk. <br />
        From the same top, they produce their flowerson stems that are
        initially enclosed in a sheath or husk (Spatha),which is opened by the
        plant’s growth. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 20.</h3>
        When comparing the flowers and blossoms in these four preceding
        classes of the plant kingdom,one finds among the various reproductive
        structures around and on the young fruit,despite all differences,
        certain parts that botanists call stamens and styles (Stamina and
        Stylus),namely, filaments with small dust-filled heads surrounding the
        fruit,and on the fruit itself, styles, either directly or at the ends
        of certain narrow, upright structures.
        <br />
        These stamens and styles are entirely absent in the following
        classes,or at least have not yet been proven and remain hidden from
        the naked eye. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 21.</h3>
        Common language applies the name moss (Muscus) to a variety of plants
        of entirely different kinds and properties.However, a more attentive
        observer quickly notices that the general concept behind this word is
        very broad and imprecise,and that these so-called mosses actually
        constitute entirely different classes or main divisions of the plant
        kingdom.
        <br />
        The class that can most precisely retain the name of mossesincludes
        plants whose stems are completely covered with ever-green small
        leaves.Most produce small, dust-filled heads (Capitulum), which are
        shaped like capsules with a lid,mostly on special stalks, though some
        are without stalks.Some bear scaly spikes (Clava), where beneath each
        scale lies a fruit-like structure.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 22.</h3>
        The remaining plants that are commonly called mosses are crustaceous
        growths (crustaceæ Plantæ),almost entirely consisting of leaf tissue,
        so that the stem – if any trace of it exists at all –is integrated
        into the leaf. Instead of roots, they either have fibrils
        (fibrillae),which serve as root substitutes and spread across the
        entire surface,or the entire leaf or organism absorbs its nutrients
        through pores (Pori) on its entire surface.
        <br />Some of these bear distinct reproductive structures with an
        evident organization,while others show nothing but a specially
        colored, sponge-like elevation on their edge or surface.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 23 .</h3>
        There also exist additional types of plants,in which neither stem,
        root, nor leaf can be identified as distinct, simultaneously present
        parts,and where almost no comparison can be made with the plantsthat
        we are more accustomed to observing.
        <br />Such are many marine plants,for which only the languages of
        coastal peoples have specific names.These cannot easily be grouped
        under a precise classification,as their development and exact
        characteristics are inherently difficult to determineand, for a
        beginner, more of a burden than a necessity to understand. <br />Thus,
        for now, one may establish a separate class under the name"unusually
        shaped plants" (Plantæ Anomalæ),and, if desired, include the
        crustaceous plants(see § 22), which were mentioned earlier.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 24.</h3>
        Ferns (Filices) have a rootbut no actual stem. Instead, the leaf
        stalk,which emerges directly from the root, takes the place of a
        stem.The leaf itself bears its reproductive structures on the
        underside,namely a multitude of tiny grains,which are just visible to
        the naked eyeand clustered together in round or elongated groups.
        <br />
        Usually, all leaves of a plant carry such grains,but in certain
        species, the fertile leavesare distinct from their neighboring leaves.
        <br />This class also includes some plantswhose structure is difficult
        to reconcilewith the usual and described organization of this

        <h3>§. 25.</h3>
        Fungi (Fungi) are soft, mostly succulent organismswith a thin,
        membranous outer layer and fine root-like filaments.They are usually,
        but not always, divided into two main parts:a stalk (Stipes) and a cap
        (Pileus).They have no leaves.
        <br />
        Their seeds consist of fine dust,which the naked eye generally does
        not perceive at alland can never clearly distinguish.It is distributed
        throughout the substance or flesh of the organism. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 26.</h3>
        Not only in common usage but also among many botanists,the study of
        the plant kingdom often begins with the distinction between tree and
        herb.However, as long as differences in size and lifespando not alter
        the essence of a thing,this distinction is not sufficient as a primary
        classification.
        <br />
        Nature shows us trees and herbs within one and the same class,that is,
        with the same structure of stem, leaves, and reproductive organs.Not
        all trees have buds or eyes (Gemma);there are trees that are only a
        few inches tall,yet have a permanent woody stem and buds.There are
        also herbs, even summer plants,that, in their short lifespan, reach
        the height of medium-sized trees.There are plants from warmer
        regionsthat endure above the root for several years in their native
        habitat,but in colder climates, they perish above the root after a
        single season. <br />Nevertheless, examining a plant’s longevity,its
        size, and the distribution of its stem has its uses,and there is no
        need to abolish the common concepts and namesof tree, shrub, and
        herb,even if there is no sufficient reason to classify the plant
        kingdom accordingly. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 27.</h3>
        If, after this general overview of the entire plant kingdom,one stops
        at one of these indicated classes and engages in a more detailed study
        of it,especially in the highly numerous class of flowering plants,one
        finds that in each class, beyond the general characteristics,there is
        so much that is unique in the structure of all parts of the organic
        form.These differences are, for the most part, so visibly distinctthat
        they give rise to subdivisions within each class,which are just as
        natural as the division of the entire kingdom into these main classes.
        <br />To establish and distinguish these subdivisions on a solid
        basis,to navigate through them,and to understand them along with their
        underlying reasons—this is what botany consists of, both for the
        teacher and the learner. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 28 .</h3>
        The thoughtful lover of botany now sees his path before himand
        realizes that the botanist, in order to reach the pointwhere he can
        become his guide, must take the same path of experiencethrough
        continuous observations and the path of inductionthrough continuous
        comparisons.
        <br />Thus, this science has had to grow with the number of plantsthat
        have become known over time, and it will continueto grow in the same
        way in the future. <br />
        If, as he progresses, the enthusiast sees that while mostexisting
        plants can be classified into natural subdivisions,following patterns
        of organic structure that are clear and indisputable,there will always
        remain a number of plants that do not seem to fit anywhereand reject
        all connection with the others,he will not be surprised.
        <br />Instead, he will be inclined to assume that these,so to speak,
        rebellious plants are individual examplesof structural forms that
        nature has also applied tomany as yet undiscovered plants,which will
        reveal themselves in due time.

        <h2>Third section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 29 .</h3>
        In order to follow the botanist through the plant kingdomand all its
        subdivisions, the enthusiast must familiarize himselfwith the organic
        structure of plants and its major variations.He must develop the habit
        of careful and detailed observation of plantsand learn the language of
        the botanist.This section provides guidance for that purpose.
        <br />However, the detailed examination of plant partsand their
        immediately recognizable characteristicsis carried out here only to
        the extent necessaryto provide an opportunity to explain the technical
        terms,the meaning of which would otherwise remain either entirely
        unknownor not precisely defined. <br />Going through all the
        variations in the structure of herbsfound in the plant kingdom is a
        task for the botanistonly when he is to provide a detailed catalog of
        herbsor explain the physiology of plants. <br />For the sake of
        convenience,and to avoid excessively disrupting the flow of
        presentation,only the main differences in plant parts andthe method by
        which they must be examined are given here. <br />As for each
        technical term specifically,the reader is referred to the alphabetical
        index of terms. <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 30 .</h3>
        There are some general observationsthat apply to several parts of
        plants,one as well as the other,and therefore require a preliminary
        mention.These include considerations of size and
        proportion,distribution, shape, margin, covering,substance, position,
        and color.
        <br />1. Size is determined partly by proportion,through comparison of a
        plant's parts with one another,especially those parts that are
        interconnected,and partly according to certain common standard
        measurements,most commonly based on the proportions of an average
        human body.Exact geometric measurements are only necessary in very
        rare cases,and applying them everywhere would be an exaggeratedand
        tedious precision. <br />2. The considerations of distribution,shape, and
        margin are best exemplifiedby the stems and leaves of plants,which
        serve as the most instructive modelsand can be easily applied to other
        parts. <br />3. The covering of different plant partsvaries not only in
        the general differences of surface,which arise from indentations and
        protruding structures,but also due to certain fine organic
        elementsdistributed across such a surface or covering.As components of
        organic structure,they deserve special examination,which is addressed
        in §. 46. <br />4. Observations concerning the substance,texture, and
        material of plant bodiesoccur particularly in leaves and fruitsbut can
        also be extended to other parts (see also §. 47). <br />5. Regarding the
        position of parts in relation to the whole,one must note the angles
        formed by a branch with the trunkor a leaf with the stem;the outer and
        inner, lower and upper sides of a petiole,a leaf, or other part,which
        are determined in relation to an actual or imagined axisof a trunk or
        branch;the front and rear end, or tip and base,of a petiole, leaf,
        flower, or fruit,which are defined by their point of attachment to the
        whole;and the curves and twists to the right or left,where one must
        imagine the observer facing south. <br />6. Regarding the position of
        parts in relation to one another,one can take as a modelthe different
        arrangements of flowers,which will be explained in due course,and
        apply the same to other parts,such as leaves when they are arranged
        similarly. <br />7. Regarding colors,it should be noted that in
        general,anything is considered "colored"if it does not bear the
        predominant color of the plant kingdom—green. <br /><br />


        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 31 .</h3>

        At the root, one distinguishes:
        <br>
        1. The main root, the branches or strands,and the fine ends or fibers.
        <br>
        2. Furthermore, one differentiates the main rootin terms of how it is embedded in the soil and spreads there,and
        its crown, which emerges from the soiland from which the stem and root leaves arise.
        <br>
        3. In many roots, in addition to the usual root strands and fibers,one notices certain knot-like bodies of
        various shapes and compositions attached to them.These contain developed germ structures,which will be discussed
        further in §. 48.They are commonly known as bulbs and tubers.
        <br>
        In general, the following considerations are made for roots,with the corresponding variations listed under each
        category:
        <br>
        4. According to their distribution:Simple, branched, without a main stem, fine-fibered,segmented, palmate,
        bundled strands.
        <br>
        5. According to their shape:Spindle-shaped, truncated, spherical.
        <br>
        6. According to their position:Penetrating or stake-like, horizontal, creeping.
        <br>
        7. According to their attached germ structures:Bulbous root, tuberous, with grains.
        <br>
        8. According to their internal structure:Dense, hollow, with partitions, membranous bulb,scaly bulb, dense bulb.
        <br>
        9. According to their substance:Delicate, firm, woody, juicy, fleshy, mealy.
        <br>
        10. According to their lifespan:Annual, biennial, perennial.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 32 .</h3>
        The root and stem have, in terms of their internal structure and substance, mostly the same composition,so that
        a tree can be turned upside down, with its roots sprouting leaves in the air,while its top forms roots in the
        soil.Due to this similarity, the examination of the stem can suitably begin with its substance.
        <br>
        A plant's stem consists of five distinct main parts,which cover each other in layers from the outside inward in
        the following order:the skin, the bark, the sapwood, the wood, and the pith.
        <br>
        In delicate, soft, and annual plants, these layers are difficult to distinguish,but in a cross-section of a
        tree,they appear clearly as concentric rings.Among these, the ones that belong to the solid wood are called the
        annual rings,which indicate the age of the stem.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 33 .</h3>
        The stem is, in general, the part of the plant above the ground that carries the other parts, such as leaves and
        flowers.However, certain types of stems have their own specific names:
        <br>
        1. The general name "stem" remains for one that bears both leaves and flowers.
        <br>
        2. "Culm" is used for the stem of grasses.
        <br>
        3. "Scape" refers to a stem that bears only flowers and no leaves.
        <br>
        4. "Stipe" is used for mushrooms, as well as for ferns, where branches, leaves, and reproductive structures
        merge into one, namely in their foliage.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 34 .</h3>
        Further Considerations of the Stem

        1. According to its longevity:Herb, perennial plant, shrub, tree.
        <br>
        2. According to its position in the soil and relative to the horizon:On another plant, creeping, rooting, with
        root sprouts, with tendrils, prostrate, sprawling, climbing, twisted, slanted, upright, curved, with a hanging
        tip, stiff.
        <br>
        3. According to its internal structure:Solid, hollow, tubular.
        <br>
        4. In terms of its cross-sectional shape:Round, semicircular, flattened, two-edged, angular, polygonal, with
        sharp angles, with blunt angles, with flat sides between the angles, with convex sides.
        <br>
        5. In terms of its surface texture:Covered with husks, with ridges in the bark, with a cork-like bark, smooth,
        striped, furrowed, glossy, rough, woolly, hairy, with bristles, with spines, with thorns, with burning tips.
        <br>
        6. In terms of leaves, leaf-like structures, and buds:Naked, without leaves, with leaves, with leaf sheaths,
        with scales, with leaf attachments, with knot-like buds.
        <br>
        7. In terms of its parts, while still being a simple stem:Undivided, with nodes, with joints, bent from one side
        to another, with sprouting tips.
        <br>
        8. In terms of its branching while still maintaining a main stem:Simple, without branches, slightly branched,
        heavily branched.
        <br>
        9. In cases where the main stem dissolves into branches:Multiple, bifurcated, bushy.
        <br>
        10. In terms of the arrangement of branches among themselves:Without a specific order, alternating from side to
        side, two opposite each other, in two rows, in a whorl, many clustered together.
        <br>
        11. In terms of the position of branches relative to the main stem:Diverging, widely spread at large angles,
        pressed against the stem, at acute angles, rod-like, bushy, conical, crossed like arms, curved upwards, arching,
        curved inwards.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 35.</h3>
        The leaf either emerges on a stalk from the stem or from the root, or it is attached directly to the stem or
        root without a stalk.
        <br>
        One distinguishes between its two ends: the front end, or tip, and the back end, or base, which is closest to
        the stem or stalk.
        <br>
        Furthermore, leaves are considered:
        <br>
        A. According to their distinctive characteristics.
        <br>
        B. According to their position on the stem and stalk.
        <br>
        C. According to the division of a main stalk into smaller stalks.
        <br>
        These considerations require a more detailed examination, as follows:

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 36 .</h3>

          <br>
          On the stem, on a branch, axillary leaf,seed leaf, root leaf, flower leaf.
          <br><br>
          9. The leaves according to their position in relation to each other:

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 38 .</h3>
        C. The Leaf According to the Division of a Main Stalk into Leaflets:
        <br><br>&#160; <p>
          12. Simple divisions of the main stalk, or simply compound leaves:
          <br>
          With fingers, double, tripled, with twoor more leaflets.Pinnate, with an unpaired leaflet, with forks,
          interrupted,with opposite leaflets,with alternating leaflets,with large and small leaflets,with continuous
          leaflets,Paired.
          <br><br>
          13. Multiple divisions of the stalk or multiple compound leaves:
          <br>
          Twice-divided, thrice-divided, twice-pinnate.
          <br><br>
          14. The parts of these compound leaves are called leaflets, and the parts of the main stalks are called
          petiolules.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 39 .</h3>
        A special type of leaves are the bracts, which, due to their position—sitting closest to the flowers and
        enclosing them between themselves and the stem—and due to their shape, can be distinguished, often also by their
        color.
        <br>
        1. They are green or colored; permanent or transient; single or multiple at one place; large or small in
        comparison to the flowers and their stalks.
        <br>
        2. They form a so-called head when they are closely packed together in a spike, frequent, and large.
        <br>
        3. Otherwise, most of the characteristics and names of regular leaves also apply to them.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 40 .</h3>
        En anden type bladlignende dele, som ikke må forveksles med egentlige blade, er fodflige eller ører. Disse
        sidder ved basis af bladstilkene, sædvanligvis uden for vinklen mellem stamme og stilk, placeret på begge sider
        af denne, og kun i sjældne tilfælde på indersiden.
        <br>
        Bortset fra deres placering på stammen gælder de fleste bladegenskaber også for dem.
        <br>
        Another type of leaf-like structures, which must not be confused with true leaves, are the stipules or auricles.
        These are located at the base of the petioles, usually outside the angle between the stem and the petiole,
        positioned on both sides of it, and only in very rare cases on the inner side.
        <br>
        Apart from their position on the stem, most other characteristics of leaves also apply to them.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 41.</h3>
        1, There are also other leaf-like structures to be noted, which sometimes surround flowers arranged in a whorl
        or an umbel at the point where their stalks converge. They may also encase the simple scape of a plant as a
        sheath and share some properties with other leaves.
        <br>
        A particular aspect to observe in such a sheath is whether it consists of a single leaf or multiple leaves. In
        the case of umbels, one distinguishes between the involucre of simple and compound umbels.
        <br>
        2. Finally, small scale-like structures are often found on various parts of a plant’s stem. These should neither
        be classified as leaves nor as the previously mentioned leaf-like structures, and they are referred to as
        scales.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 42 .</h3>
        The petiole of a leaf and the stalk of a flower or fruit share many characteristics with the stem, but there are
        still some particular considerations to be made:
        <br>
        1. The petiole of a leaf is a true stalk if it is inserted into the leaf at a single point and in such a way
        that the base of the leaf is free. However, there are leaves whose base is elongated and gradually tapers to the
        point of insertion into the plant's stem, making it difficult to say where the leaf ends and the petiole begins.
        Such an elongated base is often improperly called a petiole.
        <br>
        2. The term rib is used to describe the axis that runs lengthwise through a leaf, if it is noticeably wide and
        thick. It is also used for the extended main stalk of a pinnate leaf, from which the small stalks of the
        leaflets branch out on both sides.
        <br>
        3. The veins and nerves of leaves are considered parts and branches of the stalk, and the stalk itself is seen
        as a strand that, upon entering the leaf, splits into smaller strands. These are called nerves when they are
        straight, firm, and raised above the surface of the leaf.
        <br>
        This variation in the distribution of the stalk and the resulting network of the leaf deserves attention in
        every plant.
        <br>
        4. Distribution (of veins or nerves):
        <br>
        Radiating, palmate, in lateral branches, under sharp angles, in wide-open angles, in parallel veins, in
        irregular directions.
        <br>
        5. Leaf texture / vein network:
        <br>
        With raised veins, with imperceptible venation, with wide meshes, with narrow meshes, with dense meshes, with
        wavy meshes.
        <h3>§. 43 .</h3>
        <br /><br />

        The stalk of a flower falls under the following main considerations:
        <br><br>&#160; <p>
          1. As a main stalk that branches into smaller stalks or stems, it is most conveniently called a stem, of which
          more
          is discussed in the next §. 44.
          <br><br>
          2. In regard to its position on the main stem:
          <br>
          As with the leaf above in §. 37.8; additionally, in relation to the leaves: opposite the leaf, to the side,
          from
          the leaf axil, between the leaves, above the leaves.
          <br><br>
          3. In regard to the arrangement among each other; see the next §. 44, and also §. 37.9 above.
          <br><br>
          4. With respect to its direction relative to the stem and horizon, as with the leaf in §. 37.11 above.
          <br><br>
          5. In regard to its distinct shape:
          <br>
          As with the stem in §. 34 above; additionally: threadlike and pointed, with a thickening, club-shaped, with
          nodes, with joints, naked, with scales, with leaves, with flower bracts.
          <br /><br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>§. 44 .</h3>
        <br /><br />
        The consideration of the flower stalk naturally leads to the general consideration of the arrangement of
        flowers, whether they have stalks or not, and the so-called ways in which flowers are borne, which are primarily
        the following:
        <br>&#160; <p>
          1. Flowers with stalks, or without stalks.
          <br>
          2. Whorl: Flowers are in a whorl when they stand in a circle or in the periphery of a cross-section of the
          stem.
          Such a whorl may have many, dense flowers, or few, loose ones.
          <br>
          3. Umbel: Flowers are in the form of an umbel when their stalks all originate from a common center point, like
          lines radiating from the tip of a blunt cone to its base. One notes the shape of the umbel: whether it is
          spherical, hemispherical, flat, or depressed; and also the density of the flowers: whether crowded or sparse.
          <br>
          4. A compound umbel arises when simple umbels themselves have stalks and are arranged just like the stalks of
          the individual flowers.
          <br>
          5. A head (capitulum) or knob is when the flowers sit closely together and form a spherical or hemispherical
          space; the latter is called a divided head.
          <br>
          6. A cluster or bundle is when the flowers are long and lie closely side by side, mostly parallel to each
          other.
          <br><br>
        </p>
        In the following types of flower arrangements, there is a main stem that bears branches or stalks along its
        length:
        <br>&#160;
        <p>
          7. When the stalks are of unequal length, all pointing upward, and the flowers are arranged so that they lie
          in
          a flat plane, this creates a flat bouquet or crown.
          <br>
          8. In a spike, flowers sit directly on the main stem without distinct stalks or on very short, pressed stalks.
          The spike may take various forms: cylindrical, conical, egg-shaped; the flowers may sit randomly around the
          axis
          or in rows, to one side, in two, or in many rows; leaves may also be intermixed; and the spike itself may be
          compound, made of smaller spikelets.
          <br>
          9. Raceme: The flowers sit with short, hanging side-stalks.
          <br>
          10. When the main stem has notable branches, and these branches divide into smaller branches in the same or
          some
          defined pattern, and the stalks leading to the flowers or fruits are relatively long, this forms a cluster of
          flowers or an inflorescence tuft (Riffe). This cluster can be regular or irregular, loose or dense, hanging to
          one side or evenly spread.
          <br>
          11.A pointed bouquet is a specific type of dense cluster that has an egg-shaped, pointed form.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 45 .</h3>
        Tendrils are string-like bands that usually wind in a spiral fashion and wrap around other objects to fasten and
        support their plant.They often, though not always, split into several threads in the form of forks, from which
        they take their German name ("Gabeln" = forks).However, a more general term like "tendril" or "coil" (German:
        Kieme or Schlinge) would be preferable.
        <br>
        Sometimes, the petiole (leaf stalk), especially the midrib of compound leaves, forms such tendrils at its tip.
        <br>
        One observes on these tendrils:
        <br>
        Their position in relation to leaves and flowers,
        <br>
        Their division into prongs or tines (Zinken),
        <br>
        The manner and pattern of their spiral winding paths.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 46 .</h3>
        <br /><br />

        Beyond the examination of the main plant parts as components of a whole, there are two additional primary
        considerations of the whole:namely, the outer covering (Oberfläche) and the inner substance or tissue,insofar as
        both are recognizable and observable to the naked eye.
        <br>
        In examining the outer covering, one notices various protruding or embedded organic parts and special
        structures, such as:
        <br>
        1. Thorns, which emerge from the wood through the bark and are covered by it. Sometimes they appear
        forked.Spines, on the other hand, sit only in the bark and can be removed along with it.Also: stinging tips,
        hooks, and barbs.
        <br>
        2. Hairs: woolly, bearded, felt-like, bristly;— simple, hooked, branched, rod-shaped, feather-tufted,
        star-shaped.
        <br>
        3. Scurf (Kleye), which consists of flaky bits of a torn, delicate outer layer.
        <br>
        4. Glands that secrete sap, resin glands, warts, dots, and air bladders (as found in some aquatic plants).
        <br> <br>
        Also visible, without protruding:
        <br>
        5. Pores such as sweat-holes, and tiny dots.
        <br>
        6. A glossy smoothness; translucency, a bluish haze, soot, stickiness, slime, and rust.
        <br> <br>
        To the sense of touch, one perceives:
        <br>
        7. Smoothness, roughness, unevenness, hardness and softness, and viscous slime.
        <br>
        8. The colors (see § 96).
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 47 .</h3>
        <br /><br />
        1. The Tissue Structure:
        <br><br>&#160;<p>
          Fibrous tissue:
          <br>
          composed of long, straight, twisted, soft, tough, hard, or woody fibers.
          <br>
          Felt-like tissue:made from indistinguishable, twisted fibers.
          <br>
          Cellular tissue, lamellar or leaf-like:with large or small, empty or filled cells.→ Includes spongy matter,
          pith, with visible layers (lamellae).→ Parenchyma: composed of indistinct lamellae;— membranous, fleshy,
          cartilaginous in nature.
          <br><br>
          2. Firmness (Consistency):
          <br>
          Loose,
          Dense,
          Membranous,
          Cartilaginous,
          Bone-hard.
          <br><br>
          3. Contained Juices and Similar Matter:
          <br>
          Dry,
          Juicy,
          Watery,
          Mealy (floury),
          Grainy,
          Stony.
        </p> <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 48 .</h3>
        Nature, which in the plant kingdom has not limited reproduction to seeds or ovules, also accomplishes it through
        various types of concealed and differently developed buds, some of which lie unnoticed and hidden beneath the
        bark, only emerging under certain conditions, while others appear visibly on the root or stem.
        <br>
        Some of these enclosed buds separate from the mother plant and form a new, independent plant, while others
        remain attached and cause the mother plant to grow through the development of new parts.Among the first type are
        bulbs, tubers, and bulb-like grains.
        <br>
        1. Bulbs
        Sit at the root.
        Have a rounded shape, tapering toward the point where the bud is about to break out.
        Possess a core-like substance.
        Key characteristics are their internal structure, including:– membranous bulbs,– scale-like bulbs,– dense
        (solid) bulbs.
        <br>
        2. Tubers
        Also sit at the root as part of it.
        Have no defined shape.
        Consist of a mealy, uniform substance.
        <br>
        3. Bulb-like grains
        Some belong to the root, often appearing in jointed chains.
        Others sit on various parts of the stem.
        They can be very diverse in nature, and their characteristics must be noted individually for each species.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 49 .</h3>
        The buds that remain firmly attached to the mother plant and do not detach are known as buds (Knospen).They
        break through the bark in the form of small nodes, which are composed of overlapping small leaves or scales.
        <br><br>
        Several aspects are to be observed:
        &#160;<p>
          1. Position on the stem:
          <br>
          Often, the buds found at the tip or end of a stem or branch differ from those that emerge along the sides.The
          latter usually originate from the angles between leaf and stem – with very few exceptions among plant species.

          <br><br>
          2. Shape of the closed bud.
          <br><br>
          3. Shape of the individual scales.
          <br><br>
          4. Arrangement of the scales:
          <br>
          – Do they stand opposite each other in pairs, or– Are they alternating?
          <br><br>
          5. Outer vs. inner structure:
          <br>
          One must distinguish between:– the outer scales, which form the protective envelope, and– the bud itself,
          which begins to develop within.As the inner parts continue to grow, the outer scales eventually fall off –
          sooner or later.
          <br><br>
          6. Types of buds:
          <br>
          Some buds contain only leaves, others only flowers, and others contain both.
          <br><br>
          7. Leaf buds reveal leaf characteristics:
          <br>
          Especially when leaf buds have already begun to open, one can often already observe whether the future leaves
          will:– be stalkless,– have a stalk,– have leaf-like appendages (stipules).By continuing this line of
          observation, one can begin to trace plant relationships and similarities through their buds.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 50 .</h3>
        That the flower stands in the closest connection with the fruit, and contributes to its preparation, is evident
        to the eye and confirmed by experience.For this reason, the flower and the fruit, together with all their parts,
        are collectively understood under a general name:
        <br>
        "Fruit organs" (Fruchtwerkzeuge).The process of their development is called:Fructification.
        <br>
        This fructification occurs through an unfolding of the inner parts of the plant,which, during the process, open
        up,separate from one another,and make space for each part to emerge,and to unfold and expand into the diverse
        forms we observe.
        br
        Thus, the growth of the plant ends at each point where fructification occurs.In herbs especially, the existence
        of the fruit also marks the end of the entire plant,or at least of the stem above the root.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 51 .</h3>
        Since nature has introduced such a manifold arrangement in the fruit organs,it is advisable, before delving into
        a detailed examination,to first gain some basic concepts by observing a few of the most common garden and field
        flowers.
        <br><br>

        For example, if one chooses the flower of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum)as a model — being symmetrical and
        regularly formed in all its parts —one will see, in the center of the open flower:
        <br>
        The young fruit or ovary (Bollen),
        <br>
        Surrounded by five curved filaments (staubwege / styles),
        <br>
        Then five other filaments, each bearing a small dusty head (anther),— these are the stamens with their anthers.

        <br><br>
        Around these parts lie:
        <br>
        The five blue flower petals,
        <br>
        And, on the outermost edge, the five pointed green sepals of the flower cover (calyx).
        <br><br>

        Now, when one compares this flax flower with a tulip, rose, bellflower (Campanula), and others,one quickly
        recognizes again what are:
        <br>
        Stamens,
        Anthers,
        Styles,
        The flower itself,
        The flower cover,
        along with various modifications of the general arrangement.

        <br><br>
        For example:
        <br>
        In the tulip, there is only a flower without any calyx (flower cover).
        <br>
        In the bellflower, noticeable stigmas or absorbing spongy pads appear on the styles.
        <br>
        In the tulip, there are no prominent styles; instead, the three-parted stigma sits directly on the fruit.
        <br>
        In the rose, the receptacle or base of the flower cover becomes a juicy fruit, and each seed inside has its own
        style and stigma.
        <br>
        In the bellflower, the corolla has five notches, yet still consists of one single piece.
        <br>
        Also in the bellflower, both the stamens and corolla are not arranged around the fruit, but instead sit together
        on top of it.

        And so on.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 52 .</h3>
        If one continues such a cursory examination of plants in the field and forest, one will find some—though only a
        few—plants which bear ovaries and stamens without any covering, thus bearing naked blossoms. And one will find
        very many plants where the young fruits and stamens are not surrounded by what are properly called flowers, but
        rather enclosed in other, and indeed quite various, ways—for example in the grasses. Such forms of
        fructification, in contrast to actual flowers, can be referred to as blossoms.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 53 .</h3>
        One will also encounter a number of plants in which a kind of fructification is indeed recognizable, yet without
        any trace of stamens and styles. Such plants were already mentioned above in §§ 21–25, and more will be said
        about them. Whether one denies the existence of these reproductive organs altogether, or prefers to believe that
        they may, although invisible to our eyes, still exist and must be present—within the field of fundamental botany
        (botanica pura), which rightly limits itself to what can be perceived by the senses—it is all the same whether
        something does not exist or cannot be seen. Therefore, setting aside this physiological question, such
        fructifications can only be called fructifications without stamens and styles. They are sometimes also
        improperly referred to as blossoms, but it is advisable not to extend the term blossom beyond fructifications
        with visible stamens and styles.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 54 .</h3>
        Stamens and styles are not always found together in the same flower or blossom; rather, they are quite often
        separated into different blossoms, such that the styles with the young fruit occupy one blossom, and the stamens
        another. Both types of blossoms can be present either on the same plant or on separate individuals of the same
        species.
        <br>
        This observation about blossoms quite naturally leads to an idea that has long been vaguely suspected but is
        nowadays considered beyond doubt—namely, that a distinction of sex exists in the plant kingdom just as in the
        animal kingdom; that this difference is based on the stamens and styles; and that these parts of the flower have
        the same relation to each other as the sexual organs in animals.
        <br>
        This principle has given rise to a large number of technical terms which modern botanists use to describe
        blossoms. And even if one does not wish to accept this physiological theory as fully established, one can still
        adopt the now widely used terminology.
        <br>
        Thus, the styles, as inseparable companions of the young fruit, are the mark of the female sex; the stamens, of
        the male sex. A flower or blossom in which the young fruit and styles are present but no stamens is called a
        female blossom. A blossom with stamens but without ovary and styles is called a male blossom. And a blossom in
        which both parts are present is called a hermaphroditic blossom or flower.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 55 .</h3>
        With regard to these blossoms of different sexes, a few main observations are to be made.
        <br>
        First, concerning the form in which the male, female, or hermaphroditic blossoms—belonging to the same plant
        species and relating to one another—appear: these are not always similar to one another, but rather very often
        dissimilar. There can be entirely different arrangements in the covering of each sex’s reproductive parts within
        its blossom, or in the combination of several blossoms next to or beneath one another.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 56 .</h3>

        Another key consideration is the various distributions and coexistence of the related blossoms on the individual
        stems of their species. In this regard, more variation is found in the plant kingdom than in the animal kingdom.
        These distributions are as follows:
        <br><br>
        1. Male and female blossoms on one single plant, which are called plants with partially separated sexes.
        <br>
        2. Male and female blossoms on separate plants of the same species, with one plant bearing only male and the
        other only female blossoms—called plants with completely separated sexes, or simply a male and a female plant.
        <br>
        3. Male, female, and hermaphroditic (bisexual) blossoms on plants of the same species, often mixed together so
        that not just one type of blossom is found on a single plant. These can be called plants with mixed sex.The
        coexistence of these three types of blossoms can again occur in as many different ways (and nearly all of them
        do exist) as the number of types and their combinations on the same or different stems allow. For instance, we
        can have:
        &#160;
        <p>
          1. Male and female blossoms on one stem, male on a second.
          <br>
          2. Male and female on the first stem, female on a second.
          <br>
          3. Male and female on the first, male on a second, female on a third.
          <br>
          4.Hermaphroditic on the first, male on the second.
          <br>
          5. Hermaphroditic on the first, female on the second.
          <br>
          6. Hermaphroditic on the first, male on the second, female on the third.
          <br>
          7. Hermaphroditic on the first, male and female on the second.
          <br>
          8. Hermaphroditic on the first, male and female on the second, male on the third.
          <br>
          9. Hermaphroditic on the first, male and female on the second, female on the third.
        </p>
        4. Even more cases arise through the presence of sexless blossoms, in which neither stamens nor pistils are
        present, or if the hermaphroditic blossoms are deficient in one or the other reproductive part. In such
        cases—according to the theory of how the sex organs interact—this lack must be compensated for by another
        blossom, in which the opposite part is likewise deficient.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 57 .</h3>

        As already mentioned in § 52, the use of the word flower remains restricted to those types of blossoms in which
        the young fruit, along with the stamens and pistils—whether together or separate—is completely surrounded on all
        sides by its covering, so that this covering encloses a circular space and its base forms or occupies a full
        circle.
        <br>
        All other types of coverings we will, as also stated in the aforementioned § 52, call blossoms, and their
        particular main forms will be examined in more detail later on.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 58 .</h3>

        The flower consists either of a single envelope or, as is just as often found, of several envelopes layered on
        top of each other, enclosing one another like garments. Usually, there are two, more rarely three; but one
        should not be misled by the so-called double flowers, as these are merely deviations from the natural
        state.These envelopes are distinguished from one another by specific names. The innermost layer—or, in the case
        of double flowers, all the innermost layers that are similar in substance—retain the name flower, while the
        outer layers are called flower coverings (floral envelopes), inner and outer, if there is more than one.

        <br>
        Sometimes, one finds flowers in which two layers—an inner and an outer—are indeed present, which can be
        recognized by the differing nature of the inner and outer surfaces and by the noticeable thickness of the
        flower; however, these are not separated but fused together. Such a flower can be called a flower with a fused
        covering.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 59 .</h3>
        Many botanists have preferred to focus more on the specific properties of these floral layers—their substance
        and durability—than on their relative positions, and they use the words flower and calyx not only in the case
        where both a flower and a floral covering are present and clearly distinguishable, in which case they call the
        covering the calyx and retain the term flower for the inner part, but also in the case where only a flower
        without a covering is present. In such cases, according to their intention, it may be called either flower or
        calyx: flower, if it is made of delicate fine tissue, colored (i.e., not green), and falls off before the fruit
        ripens; calyx, in the opposite circumstances.
        <br>
        However, although flower and floral covering are generally distinguished by these criteria, it is not always so
        consistent that one could establish a rule. These characteristics are not always found together in the same
        combination, and therefore these concepts of flower and calyx are quite vague, and their usage leads to many
        inconveniences.
        <br>
        It is therefore more advisable to rely solely on the relative position of the various floral layers and their
        presence together. Consequently, as mentioned, when both outer and inner layers are present and distinguishable
        by their other characteristics, the terms flower and floral covering (or calyx) should be used as relative
        terms. But a single floral layer should simply be called flower, regardless of its material or durability.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 60 .</h3>
        After having established several key concepts in this way, one can now more easily proceed to a detailed
        examination of each individual fruit-producing organ.
        <br>
        For flowers and floral coverings, one major consideration is whether they consist of a single piece or of
        several—that is, whether they are monopetalous (single-leaved) or polypetalous (multi-leaved), in which case the
        number of petals is to be specified.
        <br>
        Another consideration is whether such a monopetalous flower or floral covering is undivided, or whether it has
        incisions, segments, or lobes that are still connected and should likewise be counted.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 61 .</h3>
        Flowers and floral coverings usually do not have a uniform hollow shape; rather, they are, in cross-section, as
        it were, divided into two distinct spaces—where the lower part is narrower and cylindrical, and the upper part
        of the flower is flared and widened.
        <br>
        In monopetalous (single-petal) flowers, the lower cylindrical part is called the tube, the widened upper part
        the limb, and the boundary between the tube and the limb is called the throat.
        <br>
        In polypetalous (multi-petal) flowers, this same consideration of the space enclosed by the combined petals also
        applies. Moreover, the lower part of each petal, which helps form the tube, is called the claw, and the upper
        part, which contributes to the limb and forms an angle with the claw, is called the blade (or lamina). The claw
        is usually paler than the blade and more or less calloused, from which the name is derived by comparison to the
        fingernails on a human hand.
        <br>
        This name is also used for flowers whose petals are not otherwise distinctly divided into two parts by a notch,
        yet whose petal bases are typically harder, paler, or otherwise different in color.
        <br />
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 62 .</h3>
        Another consideration regarding the space or cavity of flowers and floral coverings gives rise to the
        distinction between symmetrically and asymmetrically shaped flowers—that is, between regular and irregular
        flowers.
        <br>
        Namely, if we imagine a vertical axis passing through the flower from the center of its base, and all
        cross-sections of the flower made perpendicularly to this axis would produce regular shapes, then the flower is
        called regular. Any deviation from this uniformity in the cross-sections makes the flower irregular.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 63 .</h3>
        The specific forms of single-petaled and multi-petaled flowers, whether regular or irregular, are too manifold
        to assign individual names to all of them. However, this has been done for some that occur frequently and are
        characteristic of entire classes. These are listed here as follows:
        <br><br>
        Specific forms of regular flowers, both single-petaled and multi-petaled:
        <br>&#160;<p>
          1. Funnel-shaped flowers, in the shape of an inverted truncated cone.
          <br>
          2. Salver-shaped, with a cylindrical tube and a flat mouth.
          <br>
          3. Cup-shaped, with a cylindrical tube and a bowl-shaped mouth.
          <br>
          4. Bell-shaped, without a tube, with a swollen base and an opening at the widest diameter.
          <br>
          5. Globular-shaped (spherical).
          <br>
          6. Barrel-shaped, with a swelling that narrows again towards the opening.
          <br>
          7. Wheel-shaped, without a tube and flat.
          <br>
          8. Carnation-shaped flowers, multi-petaled, with long claws and plates bent at a right angle, so the whole
          flower takes the shape of a salver.
          <br>
          9. Cruciform (cross-shaped) flowers, four-petaled carnation-like flowers whose petals lie in the shape of a
          St. Andrew’s Cross.
          <br>
          10. Rose-shaped flowers, with many bowl-shaped petals without distinct claws.
          <br>
          11. Mallow-like flowers, usually multi-petaled, with fused claws, so that the whole flower appears
          single-petaled.
        </p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 64 .</h3>
        Special forms of irregular flowers, both single-petaled and multi-petaled:
        <br><br>
        12. Flowers with a two-part or two-lipped mouth: These are single-petaled, with a tube whose throat sometimes
        expands into a gaping "mouth" like that of an animal, and an irregularly shaped opening that is divided
        horizontally into an upper and lower part, or into two "lips". These flowers sometimes resemble a helmet or have
        some likeness to masked heads—this comparison is the origin of some botanical names. The lower lip is
        specifically called the “lip”, while the upper one is named according to its particular shape.
        <br><br>
        13. Flowers with spurs or sacs: In these, one part of the flower extends beyond the others in the form of a
        pointed, closed-at-the-end tube or a blunt pouch.
        <br><br>
        14. Butterfly-shaped flowers (Papilionaceous flowers): Pea flowers consist of four petals (very rarely are all
        four fused together), one of which is shaped like a small boat, hence called the “keel”, and encloses the young
        fruit along with the stamens. It is located at the bottom and is sometimes split into two halves from the base,
        appearing two-footed. Opposite the keel, at the top of the flower, is the standard (or banner), usually the
        largest petal, spread flat and often folded down the middle. Between the keel and the standard, on either side
        of the fruit, are the wings, two completely similar petals facing in the opposite direction to the standard.
        <br><br>
        This flower form is named from its resemblance to a butterfly with outspread wings.
        <br><br>
        15. Orchid flowers consist of six petals or parts:– The innermost is two-lipped.– The upper lip consists of a
        callous (thickened) structure connected with the fruit, on which the stamens and pistils are united.– The lower
        lip forms a spur or sac.– On the sides of the callous structure are two small, similar petals.– Surrounding
        these are three outer petals arranged in a triangle, usually similar to each other, forming a kind of floral
        covering around the inner parts.
        <h3>§. 65 .</h3>
        In many flowers, one finds both appendages on the flower itself (which can be seen as distinct from the flower
        if we view the flower as a simple membrane shaped and folded in various ways), as well as certain organic parts
        that are completely separate from the flower. These should be counted among the reproductive organs, in addition
        to the essential and universally present elements of fructification in all blossoms.
        <br>
        It is difficult to bring these flower appendages and special types of reproductive parts together under one
        general, precise concept or to give them a suitable common name. Therefore, it is most advisable to make a
        distinction:
        <br>
        Those connected to the flower are called appendages of the flower.
        <br>
        Those separate and independent are called accessory parts of the blossom.
        <br>
        Both types, however, may be referred to as nectaries or nectar-holding structures if they demonstrably contain
        some kind of fluid.
        <br>
        Since these appendages and accessory parts are often highly specific in structure depending on the plant
        species, no general rule can be given for describing them. Therefore, the most appropriate terms must be chosen
        in each case, and one should otherwise apply botanical terminology suited to similar circumstances.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 66 .</h3>
        So far, we have been speaking of flowers that stand individually, each in its own place on the plant, without
        any direct or necessary connection to one another. However, there are plants on which multiple flowers, each
        with its own distinct reproductive parts, are joined together at a common point, forming what is called a
        composite flower, complete with its own floral covering (in this case, the floral envelope of a composite
        flower). Such plants make up a very large class, accounting for approximately one-eighth of the entire plant
        kingdom.

        <br>
        In these composite flowers, the reproductive units (florets) are sessile (i.e., without stalks) and sit directly
        on a common receptacle, which occupies the entire inner space of the floral covering.
        <br>
        If we compare this joining of several individual flowers without stalks on a common base to the arrangements
        described above in § 44, no. 3 and 8, where many flowers are arranged next to each other in umbels and spikes,
        we find many similarities between these types of inflorescence.
        <br>
        If we imagine that in a composite flower, each floret had a short or long stalk, then a composite flower with a
        flat or slightly convex receptacle would resemble an umbel, and one with a tall, conical receptacle would
        resemble a spike. Conversely, umbels and spikes can be imagined as composite flowers if we mentally remove the
        stalks of their individual florets.
        <br>
        Further similarities between the coverings of composite flowers and the bracts of umbels, etc., will not be
        discussed here.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 67 .</h3>
        In these composite flowers, one can observe four distinct forms of the individual small flowers (florets), which
        are generally all monopetalous (i.e., having a single fused petal tube):
        <br><br>
        1. Regular tubular florets, with a short tube and a bell-shaped or star-shaped mouth.
        <br>
        2. Irregular short-tubed florets, with a deeply lobed, irregular mouth and a short tube.
        <br>
        3. Irregular long-tubed florets, with a deeply lobed, irregular mouth and a long, irregularly curved tube.
        <br>
        4. Irregular ray florets, with an almost unrecognizable tube, and instead of a mouth, a flat extension or ray,
        which in the natural arrangement of the floret within the composite flower, is directed like a ray from the
        center toward the periphery.This is a special type of floral form, which can be added to those previously
        described in §§ 63 and 64.Such a floret resembles more the petal of a carnation than a complete flower.
        <h3>§. 68 .</h3>
        From such florets, the entire composite flowers are assembled in various ways:
        <br> <br>
        1. Entirely from regular tubular florets, which are called flat-flowered (plat-blossoming) flowers for another
        reason.
        <br>
        2. Entirely from short-tubed irregular florets, which are also called clustered flowers for another reason.
        <br>
        3. Entirely from long-tubed irregular florets, which are referred to as head-shaped flowers due to their shape.
        <br>
        4. From regular tubular florets over the entire base of the flower, except for the outer edge, where ray florets
        (flattened ones) are found – these are called radiate flowers.
        <br>
        5. Entirely from ray florets, which are called flat-petaled flowers.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 69 .</h3>
        In the same manner, within the composite flowers, among the florets from which they are composed, one finds a
        curious mixture of florets of different sexes. However, this is not the place to elaborate on all these
        distinctions, and a reference to §56 is sufficient.
        <br>
        But something specific must still be said about the involucres (floral coverings) of these composite flowers, as
        they provide very convenient characteristics for the classification of this extensive class within the plant
        kingdom.
        <br>
        They generally consist of many small leaflets or scales, and only in rare cases do these appear to be fused
        together to form a single whole. These small leaflets are arranged in some species like roof tiles overlapping
        each other, in others like palisades, standing parallel side by side in one or more layers. Particularly notable
        are those involucres that seem to consist of two divisions, where at the base of the actual involucre other
        scales of a different shape and orientation are found. This is called an involucre with an appendage.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 70 .</h3>
        The receptacle (base) of these composite flowers also requires special consideration. It is sometimes covered
        with hairs, sometimes with leaves, which occupy the spaces between the seeds. Occasionally, after the seeds have
        been removed, one finds it not only dotted with small points—which are the usual marks of the seeds that were
        previously present—but also with small pits arranged in checkerboard-like rows.
        <br>
        If it is neither hairy, nor leafy, nor pitted, it is called, in contrast to all of these, a naked receptacle.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 71 .</h3>
        With regard to flower coverings (floral envelopes) in general, aside from what they share with the flowers
        themselves, there is little more to be noted overall. One observes in them, likewise, their division and the
        number of parts, the shape of the whole and of the individual parts.
        <br>
        One also notes whether the covering is simple or consists of multiple layers, thus forming a double floral
        covering, in which case these two coverings are usually not alike. As mentioned above in § 69, one also observes
        whether the base of the covering has an appendage or not, and so forth.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 72 .</h3>
        <br /><br />
        Another special type of floral covering, usually a common covering for multiple flowers, is the spathe
        ("Blumenscheide").

        <br>
        It is a sac or sheath that opens on one side by means of a simple slit, as if cut open, and contains a stem with
        a flower, or even a main stem with several attached fructifications.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 73 .</h3>
        The other forms of blossoms in which the fruit and the stamens do not have a flower-shaped covering but rather a
        different kind of covering unique to them are the inflorescences of grasses and the so-called catkins.
        <br><br>
        1. The flower coverings of grasses consist of hollowed-out small leaves or husks, which enclose the other
        reproductive organs like two sheets of paper folded over one another along the edges.Two such husks, enclosing
        stamens and seeds—or sometimes just one of the two (since the separation of sexes also occurs in
        grasses)—constitute a flower.One or more of such flowers are then surrounded by a kind of covering, which also
        consists of similar husks (the flower covering of grasses), and both together—the flower(s) with their
        covering—form a spikelet.
        <br>
        2. The flower covering usually fits closely around the flower and encloses it from both sides; this is the
        proper flower covering.However, sometimes small leaves are found on the spikelet that only cover one side, lie
        loosely at the top, or don’t even enclose the flower precisely—these make up an improper covering or husk.
        <br>
        3. On the husks, there is often a projecting stiff point or awn, and these are the awns of grasses.
        <br>
        4. Even among grasses, one sometimes finds unusual organs beneath the usual reproductive parts, which, just like
        the additions described in §65 with actual flowers, are also called appendages.
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>§. 74 .</h3>
        The aforementioned gives rise to the following observations regarding the grasses, namely to consider:
        <br><br>
        1. The shape of the husks, and whether they have awns or not—i.e., whether they are unarmed.
        <br>
        2. The shape of the entire spikelet.
        <br>
        3. The number of husks in the covering of the spikelet, or the number of small leaves in an improper covering.
        <br>
        4. The number of flowers in a single spikelet.
        <br>
        5. The appendages of the flowers.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 75 .</h3>
        The catkins consist of a cylindrical, conical, or sometimes spherical body that forms the base for many united
        fructifications, and is covered with small leaflets or scales, under each of which lies a fructification without
        any further distinctive covering.
        <br>
        Cones are a type of catkin, with unusually large and thick woody scales, under which only seeds lie, without
        male reproductive organs; for this reason, cones are usually classified among the forms of fruit, which can be
        referred to in § 85.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 76 .</h3>
        1. A stamen consists of two parts: the filament itself and the anther, which is filled with pollen.
        <br>
        2. It is common in the plant kingdom that each stamen stands on its own, without connection or fusion with
        neighboring filaments or with the styles, but such connections are also found in many plants.
        <br>
        3. The filaments of the stamens can be fused together, either all in one group or in several groups, and such
        flowers are called flowers with united filaments, in one, two, or more parts.
        <br>
        4. The anthers of the stamens can also be fused, and such flowers are said to have united anthers.
        <br>
        5. Both the filaments and anthers can be fused, and such flowers are called flowers with completely united
        stamens.
        <br>
        6. If the stamens are fused with the styles within a flower, then these are flowers with united sexes.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 77 .</h3>
        The stamens—both the filaments and the anthers—within the same flower are not always of the same nature.
        <br><br>
        1. Often, the lengths of the filaments vary, and such a difference in length is consistently observed by nature
        in certain large classes of plants—for example, regular flowers with twice as many stamens as petals or lobes,
        the so-called four-petaled cruciform flowers, and irregular flowers with bilabiate (two-lipped) openings, etc.
        <br>
        2. Sometimes, the filaments differ in other characteristics, and in such cases, the dissimilar filaments usually
        appear in alternating (i.e., staggered) positions.
        <br>
        3. Occasionally, the anthers are not alike, and sometimes an anther is entirely missing from a filament—these
        are called imperfect stamens, etc.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 78 .</h3>
        Based on these observations, the following aspects and circumstances are considered when examining the stamens:
        <br><br>
        1. The number of stamens, typically counted from one to twelve; if the number exceeds that, such a flower is
        called a flower with many stamens.
        <br>

        2. The relationship between the number of stamens and the parts or lobes of regular flowers.
        <br>
        3. Whether the filaments or anthers are fused with each other, or whether the stamens are connected to the
        ovary.
        <br>
        4. The distinct shape and specific characteristics of the filaments.
        <br>
        5. Likewise, the specifics of the anthers.
        <br>
        6. The position of the anther on its filament.
        <br>
        7. The arrangement of the stamens within the flower, in terms of regularity or irregularity.
        <br>
        8. Likewise, regarding the specific location where they are inserted.
        <br>
        9. Any inequality or dissimilarity between the stamens.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 79.</h3>
        1. The young fruit, along with the stamens attached to it, together form the ovary.
        <br>
        2. A stigma consists of two parts: the style and the stigma.
        <br>
        3. However, sometimes the style is absent, and the stigma sits directly on the young fruit.
        <br>
        4. Usually, it is distinctly separated and moistened with a sticky sap or slime, on which the pollen or dust
        from the anthers adheres.
        <br>
        5. Sometimes, however, the stigma is indistinct and does not appear as a part noticeably different from the
        style.
        <br>
        6. The stigma on a style is sometimes divided, so that it appears to have multiple distinct parts, but they are
        counted as one.
        <br>
        7. Sometimes the styles are fused together.
        <br>
        8. Sometimes, the stamens are connected to the style. See § 76, note 5.
        <br>
        9. In general, when considering the stamens, the rule given in § 78 for the stamens should also be followed
        accordingly.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 80 .</h3>
        One can already recognize the eventual form of the mature fruit on the young fruit.
        A key consideration regarding the fruit is whether it consists of uncovered, naked seeds or seeds that are
        clothed and enclosed in a casing.
        <br><br>
        From this arise two main considerations:
        <br><br>
        1. The seed itself, whether naked or clothed.
        <br>
        2. The seed casing.
        <br>
        3. It should be noted here, to avoid confusion over the terms "naked" and "clothed," that although every seed
        has its skin, just as an egg has its shell, a seed is still called naked if it has no covering other than its
        own skin, and no covering that falls away naturally or can be removed without destroying the substance and the
        ability for growth.
        <br>
        4. It is also worth noting that although the flower covering often encloses and protects the seed until it is
        fully ripe, such covering is not counted as the seed casing, and the seed thus protected is still considered
        uncovered, even though these "pseudo-seed casings" may be worth noting in the plants where they occur.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 81 .</h3>

        1. The seed consists of three parts: the skin, the kernel, and the germ.
        <br>
        2. The germ quickly shows its two main parts at the beginning of the plant's growth: the little plant,
        consisting of delicate, scale-like leaves, and the root, which is a simple strand.
        <br>
        3. The kernel, from which the developing plant draws its first nourishment, often consists of only one piece,
        most commonly of two halves, and very rarely of several pieces, which swell at the start of vegetation and grow
        into a type of leaves known as seed leaves.
        <br>
        4. The skin, which bursts from the swelling of the kernel and gradually loosens, shows a scar, which is the
        place on the seed where it was attached to its casing or to the bottom of the flower.
        <br>
        5. A seed that is surrounded by a hard stone-like shell is called a nut.
        <br>
        6. Sometimes the seed, besides its attached skin, is wrapped in another easily detachable skin or covering.
        <br>
        7. The seed sometimes has additions or parts attached to it that don't actually belong to its body, such as
        wings spread out flat along its circumference.
        <br>
        8. Or crowns sitting atop the seed, either consisting of small leaf-like spikes.
        <br>
        9. Or hair-like crowns, which are particularly common in the class of plants with compound flowers. These crowns
        sometimes have their own stalk. Their rays are either simple or hair-like, or feathered like a flag.
        <br><br>
        From these observations, and from the position of the naked seed in the flower or the clothed seed in its
        casing, the considerations to be made about seeds arise naturally without further elaboration.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 82 .</h3>
        There are two main considerations regarding the seed case, namely:
        <br><br>
        1. Whether such a seed case is stuffed in its inner space, or if, aside from the seed, it is otherwise empty,
        and whether the fruit is fleshy or hollow.
        <br>
        2. Whether a seed case naturally opens in a specific way or not.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 83 .</h3>
        This being assumed, the different types of fruits with seed coverings can be categorized into the following main
        forms:
        <br><br>
        Hollow Fruits:
        <br><br>
        1. Capsule: As a main term, it includes the pod and husk and generally refers to a thin, hollow seed covering
        that opens in a specific way.
        <br>
        2. The opening of the capsule occurs in two ways: either the shell is made of parts that are sewn together with
        a seam, which bursts open, causing the parts to separate, or the shell is made of a single piece but perforated
        in certain places.
        <br>
        3. One must note the arrangement of the parts and the direction of the seams in the shell composed of parts. The
        direction of the seams is either horizontal or crosses in a transverse direction, as in some capsules that open
        like boxes or split into two hemispheres, or it is oriented along the length, and the capsule splits from top to
        base or vice versa, and is constructed like a barrel made of staves, which are counted.
        <br>
        4. The inner space of the capsule is either simple or divided by partition walls into compartments, which are
        counted, and it is called a capsule with simple space or with compartments. These partition walls either run
        completely through from the shell of the capsule to its midpoint or axis, creating fully separated compartments,
        or they only extend partway from the shell into the inner space, creating partially separated compartments.
        <br>
        5. When the compartments are fully separated, there is a true axis or pillar in the middle of the capsule, where
        the partition walls meet. Likewise, a special body rises from the base in the middle of the space in capsules
        with simple space, as well as in the compartments of partitioned capsules, which serves the same purpose.
        <br>
        6. Namely, the seed grains in a capsule are either attached to the inner side of the shell parts or staves, or
        to the aforementioned pillar, and this attachment occurs either through a special stem or thread or in an
        unnoticeable way, almost as if glued or fitted in.
        <br>
        7. The term "pod" can be used for any capsule that is thin and has a significant length in proportion to its
        small thickness. Some botanists restrict this term to those capsules whose shell consists of two identical parts
        sewn together with two similar seams, in which the seed alternates from one seam to the other, such as the
        fruits of plants with cruciform four-petaled flowers. If these pods are shortened, and due to their shortened
        body fall under the main category of a capsule, they are called "Schörgen."
        <br>
        8. The word "husk," which is often confused with "pod" in common language, is best applied to the fruits
        commonly called "pods" or "seed pods" of plants with pea-like flowers and other fruits of similar nature. It
        refers to a (usually elongated) capsule made of two identical shell pieces, but sewn together with two
        differently shaped seams, one broader upper and one lower indistinguishable seam, and it carries all the seeds
        in its upper seam.
        <br>
        9. A fruit pod differs from a capsule in that it is also a hollow shell fruit but does not open in a specific
        way. Instead, it bursts open on one side in a split.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 84 .</h3>
        Fleshy Fruits, which also have an undivided surface:
        <br><br>
        1. A pear or apple-shaped fruit is a capsule covered with flesh.
        <br>
        2. A cherry or plum-shaped fruit (stone fruit) is a nut covered with flesh.
        <br>
        3. A berry contains seeds within its flesh, which, however, does not have any other covering.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 85 .</h3>
        To fit the common usage and the terms introduced in everyday life, a few special forms of so-called fruits,
        where the seed is actually naked and uncovered according to more precise definitions, must be mentioned after
        the true forms of seed cases have been explained.
        <br><br>
        1. The cones, as noted in §. 75, differ from the Kåßgen in no essential way but only in the thickness and woody
        substance of the scales.
        <br>
        2. Similarly, the flower cover sometimes forms a kind of casing around the seed by enclosing it in a
        belly-shaped cavity, or its leaves and lobes fold together and envelop the seed at the time of ripening.
        <br>
        3. In the grasses, the husks typically close around the seed without opening voluntarily; sometimes, they are
        even attached to the seed grain.
        <br>
        4. Particularly, the term "berry" in common usage is very vague, as it generally refers to a somewhat round,
        small, juicy body containing seeds, which, however, is often not a closed fruit or seed case, and according to
        this definition, a berry can arise from all parts of the fruit's fertilization.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 86 .</h3>

        Finally, for all the fruit organs of the flower explained so far, it is important to note the manner and place
        of their connection with each other, especially in the flowers.
        <br><br>
        1. The position of the flower relative to the fruit, whether the flower is around the fruit at the bottom, with
        its base around the base of the ovary, or in the middle of the fruit around the body of the ovary, or at the top
        of the fruit.
        <br>
        2. The position of the flower relative to the flower cover, whether their two bases are on the same plane, or if
        the flower is attached to a particular ring of the flower cover, or whether the flower and cover are separated
        by the fruit between them, which is still very rare.
        <br>
        3. The position and attachment of the stamens in and on the flower, or on the flower cover, or at the base of
        the ovary.
        <br>
        4. The position of the naked seeds, whether a special base in the flower is raised to hold them.
        <br>
        5. The position and attachment of the seed grains in the seed casings.
        <br>
        6. Regarding the position and connection of the stamens and pistils with each other, the necessary details have
        already been given in §. 76.
        <br>
        7. Similarly, the connection of multiple fertilizations in a compound flower, §. 66.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 87 .</h3>
        After the flowers, the fertilizations without stamens need to be explained, in which it is not yet clearly
        understood in the physiology of plants how the seed generation actually occurs. However, they are still
        considered here in fundamental botany, as they are seen, and at least their fertilization parts can be safely
        assumed.
        <br><br>
        Mosses:
        <br><br>
        1. The fertilization of mosses, which was explained earlier in §. 21, consists primarily of a body shaped like a
        box, which is filled with dust at the time of its ripening.
        <br>
        2. This box usually has its own lid, which tapers into a conoidal beak, and the opening of the box, when the lid
        is removed, is usually closed with hairs.
        <br>
        3. There is also usually a conoidal cap sitting on top of these boxes above the lid.
        <br>
        4. Furthermore, the boxes usually have their own stem, which is thickened at the base or is usually covered with
        scale-like leaves.
        <br>
        5. In some moss species, there are no such boxes; instead, special dust containers lie beneath scales or leaves,
        similar to the fertilizations in the capsules.
        <br>
        6. In some species, one finds certain germs, so to speak, developed and made up of fine leaves, in such a way
        that different plants, which must otherwise be counted as one species, one carrying germs and the other carrying
        boxes as usual. This has led some botanists to hypothesize about a difference in sex, and thus such a plant with
        germs is called female, and the one with boxes is called male.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 88 .</h3>
        1. Ferns usually produce a multitude of small grains on the underside of all their leaves, which the naked eye
        can hardly recognize individually. However, when viewed under a magnifying glass, they appear to be organic and
        assembled, mostly as spheres with a transparent shell, a paternoster-shaped ring around them, and filled with
        the finest seeds inside.
        <br>
        2. These grains are often, especially when newly emerged, covered entirely or partially with a piece of the
        leaf's outer layer, acting as a cover.
        <br>
        3. In some ferns, not all leaves bear fruit, but only the innermost ones in the usual leaf cluster. These are
        also usually different in shape from the outer leaves in the cluster's circumference. Sometimes, there is no
        true leaf that carries the fruiting bodies, but a special stem instead.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 89 .</h3>
        For fungi, the seed is not considered here due to its fineness, as only the aspects that can serve as
        identifying markers are discussed. The focus is rather on the noticeable differences in their structure.
        <br> <br>
        1. Young fungi usually emerge from a shell as from an egg, and in the case of the bracket fungi, a membrane is
        usually stretched over the lower leaf-like side, the remnants of which are often retained by the stem as a ring
        or bulge during growth.
        <br>
        2. In most fungi with caps, the underside of the cap consists entirely of leaves that are all directed from the
        edges toward the center. They are not always of the same nature, with some being narrower and shorter than the
        others, so they do not reach the center.
        <br>
        3. In other cap fungi, the underside consists entirely of cells or small tubes that have grown closely together
        or are dug into a shared substance, so that the underside has a sieve-like surface. In very few cases, the
        underside of the cap has spines or prickles, but without stiffness.
        <br>
        4. The upper side or the covering of the cap often has something remarkable about it.
        <br>
        5. Some fungi have a head covered with a net.
        <br>
        6. Some are composed of a lattice made from rods.
        <br>
        7. Some have a smooth and otherwise unremarkable surface.
        <br>
        8. Some are composed of a completely enclosed dense body, whose flesh dissolves into fine dust in most species
        of this type.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 90 .</h3>
        The unusually shaped herbs (§ 22) have such varied structures in their fruitification that nothing general can
        be said about them. Therefore, a detailed consideration of these herbs is best omitted until one reaches the
        classification of plant species in a catalogue.
        <br>
        In some, the fruitification is flower-like, with parts that resemble the stamens and a flower covering; in
        others, it consists of vessels like cups filled with grains; often, both types of fruitification can be found on
        one plant or on plants of the same species. In the scabious stone and earth mosses, it is a shield that differs
        from the rest of the plant by its color and thickening; in some aquatic plants, it is a bubble or a knot; in
        many water plants, no part of the plant is distinguishable from the others.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 91 .</h3>
        The plant kingdom, like the animal kingdom, has its monstrosities and peculiarities, individual plants that
        deviate from the general organization or from the structure of their particular or related species. Among these
        deviations, some are more or less common and have something in common, about which the botanist must inform his
        students in advance, especially so that such a plant does not confuse them if it appears. One can specifically
        call those monstrosities where the general organization of the plant kingdom is altered, and singularities refer
        to plants that merely deviate from their relatives. The most remarkable deviations of both kinds occur in the
        parts of the fruitification, and the main ones are as follows:
        <br><br>
        1. Double flowers arise from a multiplication of the flower or its parts, the flower petals and nectar chambers,
        whereas the stamens are absent and suppressed, or usually grow into petals. In a semi-double flower, some
        stamens remain, whereas in a fully double flower, they are completely absent.
        <br>
        2. Sprouting flowers occur when one flower grows out of another, in simple flowers from the ovary, in compound
        flowers from the base, or in umbels by the formation of a new umbel. Very rarely, a flower sprouting from
        another flower will produce a flower with leaves, essentially forming a complete branch.
        <br>
        Since this filling and sprouting of flowers occurs at the expense of the actual reproductive organs, these
        monstrosities also do not propagate by seed but by division of the roots (except perhaps in semi-double
        flowers), and the special structure typically persists in the offshoots.
        <br>
        3. Germinating flowers, where one or another part of the fruitification turns into green-colored leaves, almost
        as if a new plant is sprouting from the stem.
        <br>
        4. Deficient flowers, where a flower is missing in the blossom of a plant, yet it is otherwise always found in
        the same class of plants to which such a plant belongs, and can also be found on other plants of the same
        species.
        <br>
        5. This category also includes various diseases of the herbs, such as smut on the flowers, powdery mildew, the
        growth of seeds into so-called mother grains, mold, rust, spots on leaves causing them to become multicolored,
        galls or bumps, and growths caused by insects, etc.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 92 .</h3>
        So far, the parts of the plant structure have been considered individually: when all are taken together, the
        concept of the entire growth and appearance of a plant emerges. Generally, when one speaks of the "appearance"
        of a plant, it refers to a vague concept of a plant, which the person who forms such a concept does not develop
        sufficiently in their own mind and therefore cannot clearly communicate to another person or believe they can.
        It is a vague image, something that is easier to feel than to describe.
        <br>
        This word "appearance" has acquired another meaning since the inventors of botanical methods, more than the
        first researchers of plants in nature, turned their attention to the observation of the reproductive organs, and
        primarily based the reasoning of their methods on these parts, excluding the rest of the parts of the plant. In
        this sense, the "appearance" refers to what a plant has beyond the reproductive organs.
        <br>
        However, with expanded insights into the structure of plants and the agreement and variety among them, and with
        an improved teaching method, the botanist understands the "appearance" of a plant as everything it has in its
        entire growth, from the beginning to the end of its existence, in relation to what it has in common or distinct
        in comparison to its related plants. Their concepts extend to the entire growth, without excluding any part of
        the entire structure, and without opposing the reproductive organs to the rest of the parts. The botanist must
        be able to develop and clearly state what constitutes the so-called "appearance" of a plant.
        <br>
        To provide such a detailed explanation of the appearance of a plant, it is necessary to recall the previously
        discussed considerations of all the individual parts and to apply these considerations to each class to which
        the plant belongs, knowing what is worth noting and only that. It is always useful to have a summary guide in
        the memory for the observations to be made on the plants encountered, roughly as follows.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 93 .</h3>
        One should note:
        <br> <br>
        1. Germination from the seed, how the kernel of the seed either breaks into no parts, two parts, or multiple
        parts, and from this, seed leaves emerge, how these leaves are structured, and how their development proceeds,
        etc.
        <br>
        2. Root formation, how the roots are composed, how they are arranged, how they spread, etc.
        <br>
        3. Stemming, how the stem is structured, how it divides into branches, how it relates to the placement of
        leaves, etc.
        <br>
        4. Budding, the structure and position of the buds.
        <br>
        5. Leafing, or what should be noted about the leaves, particularly the development of young leaves, their
        attachment with or without a stem, their position on the stem, their arrangement, their venation.
        <br>
        6. Flowering, or in general, what should be noted about the flowers and the way they bloom, especially the
        flowering arrangement on the stem and among each other; the type of flowers, to which major categories the
        various parts of the reproduction belong in the plant present; the formation of the flower, how the reproductive
        parts are connected to each other within a flower.
        <br>
        7. The direction of the various parts of the plant relative to the horizon and each other, twisting, pushing,
        tilting, reversing positions, bending of such parts, etc. The so-called "sleep" of the plants, or the voluntary
        closing and opening of plants at certain times, excitability, or movements that occur in response to a stimulus
        and as though to a true sensation.
        <br>
        8. The covering of the entire plant and its individual parts, in terms of appearance and texture, particularly
        with respect to the special organic parts incorporated in the surface.
        <br>
        9. The substance of the entire plant, the texture of its fibers, its flesh, its juices, etc.
        <br>
        10. Finally, among other considerations, the times of major changes in the plant's life: sprouting after sowing,
        greening, particularly the formation of buds, flowering, ripening, wilting, leaf-falling in trees, and similar
        observations that could form the basis for a kind of botanical calendar.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 94 .</h3>
        Since the great forests are the homeland of plants, and the characteristics of the places where nature allows
        them to grow on their own are worth noting, because one must follow these notes both when searching for wild
        plants and when cultivating and maintaining carefully planted ones, specific concepts and terms are necessary.
        <br><br>
        When determining the climate, one must, in addition to the latitude and longitude, also pay attention to the
        location in the atmosphere or the altitude, and remember that on the Alps, the climate is approximately the same
        in all directions.
        <br><br>
        In general, one must remember from geographical descriptions that the weather conditions in regions under the
        same latitude can vary greatly, and the proximity to the sea on islands and coastlines, or its distance in large
        landmasses, even the changes in the surface of the earth caused by population, make a difference.
        <br><br>
        Accordingly, one can approximately assume the following main climates:
        <br><br>
        1. The Indian Climate, found between the tropics, especially on islands and coasts, where there is no winter,
        water does not freeze, and exhalations from the mouth are not visible due to the coldness of the air, where at a
        certain time of the year, a constant rain sets in for several months, creating two main seasons in which most
        plants bloom twice a year.
        <br>
        2. The Egyptian and Arabian Climate, distinguished by exceptional heat and persistent drought in these regions,
        where the heat alone hatches ostrich eggs in the sand and heats the earth to the point where it cannot be walked
        on with bare feet.
        <br>
        3. The Southern Hemisphere Climate, roughly from Ethiopia to the Cape of Good Hope in Africa, and from Peru and
        Brazil in America, where the heat is milder than in the Indian climate, and summer occurs when it is winter for
        us, during which many African plants bloom at their natural time, which they also observe here with us.
        <br>
        4. The Southern European Climate, which is similar to the Asiatic climate at the same latitude, from southern
        France across the Mediterranean Sea and its islands. However, it can be further and more precisely divided into
        continental and insular climates, with the latter being warmer than the former.
        <br>
        5. The Northern European Climate, from the borders of Italy to Lapland, which should be divided into the
        temperate and Arctic climates, with the Baltic Sea serving as the boundary.
        <br>
        6. The Eastern Climate (i.e., Northern Latitude) extends across the vast landmass of Northern Asia, Siberia, and
        Tartary, along the borders of Persia and China, with many early spring plants.
        <br>
        7. The Western Climate (Northern Latitude) includes North America up to Carolina, and has many plants that bloom
        late in the year, which encounter winter too early here.
        <br>
        8. The Alpine Climate on the high mountains of the entire earth, where no trees can grow, the snow remains in
        many places from year to year, and a very short summer of two to three months follows a long winter, without
        spring or autumn.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 95 .</h3>
        On the ground or in the places where plants, each according to its kind, are accustomed to grow, two main
        considerations arise, namely the type of soil and the location.
        <br> <br>
        Under the type of soil, no pure soils are meant here, but mixtures of different types, among which one is
        particularly abundant. They are mainly the following:
        <br> <br>
        Sandy soil, such as ordinary sand, loose sand, coarse sand, or gravel; clay, marl, chalk, dam earth, and a
        special coarse, loose, poor kind of it found on the rock tops of the Alps.
        <br> <br>
        The difference in location can be roughly indicated as follows:
        <br> <br>
        Water-rich Locations:
        <br> <br>
        1. In salty seawater. Marine plants nourish themselves without roots and are subject to the movements of the
        waves.
        <br>
        2. Seashores that are flooded by seawater from time to time, either sandy, covered with gravel, or muddy.
        Coastal plants taste salty, are fleshy, and often found on land near salty lakes and springs.
        <br>
        3. Springs and streams of the purest, coldest water.
        <br>
        4. Ponds and rivers with pure water and deep enough that they do not freeze to the bottom.
        <br>
        The water plants growing here have spongy tissue, smooth surfaces, usually floating leaves, and frost-free
        roots.
        <br>
        5. Swamps contain impure water mixed with earth and mud and are not so deep that they cannot freeze to the
        bottom.
        <br>
        Swamp plants are usually smooth and often sharp or toxic.
        <br>
        6. Flooded areas, where water stands for a while in winter or after heavy rains, then dries out again.
        <br>
        7. Marshes have rough, sour soil beneath which stagnant water remains, and the surface can dry out under intense
        summer heat.
        <br>
        8. Turf mosses have rough, acidic, water-rich soil filled with roots, which slowly rises in spring.
        <br>
        9. Marshland are areas that have been drained of salty or fresh water, with a muddy base, from which water has
        been removed by draining ditches.
        <br> <br>
        Elevated Locations:
        <br> <br>
        10. The ridge of high mountains or the Alps, where forests end, steep, hard, free, exposed to sun and wind,
        mostly covered with deep snow, which arrives early before the harsh winter cold and leaves late.
        <br>
        Alpine plants are low-growing and sparse in form.
        <br>
        11. The slopes of the Alps with thick forests and deeper, moist dam soil.
        <br>
        12. Mountain plains (lower mountains and hills) have a dry, hard base, which the sun dries out, and over which
        rainwater washes away.
        <br>
        13. Rocky cliffs and crags. Many fleshy plants grow here, which can endure long periods without rain or drought.
        <br>
        14. Hilltops or slopes of mountains, exposed to certain winds and the sun at particular times.
        <br> <br>
        Shaded Locations:
        <br> <br>
        15. Groves or thickets, dense dark forests where wind and sun cannot penetrate, with the ground covered with
        loose, moist dam soil and in autumn covered with fallen leaves.
        <br>
        Shaded plants are usually fragile, pale, and bloom early, before the trees are fully leafed.
        <br>
        16. Forests that are cleared, where the sun can penetrate, the wind can pass through, the ground is rough and
        hard, and the tree roots are exposed.
        <br>
        17. Forests of coniferous or broad-leaved trees are very different in terms of the herbs growing beneath them.
        <br>
        18. Shrubs and bushes without tall trunks, where the herbs growing between the shrubs are more shaded and
        enclosed.
        <br>
        Among these bushes, the alder bushes in broken areas should be particularly noted.
        <br>
        19. Burnt areas in forests, where trees and shrubs have been cleared by fire.
        <br> <br>
        Open Locations:
        <br> <br>
        20. Farmland, where the plow moves at certain times of the year.
        <br>
        21. Meadows, which are secured for grass growth for grazing.
        <br>
        22. Pastures, open areas for livestock grazing.
        <br>
        23. Heaths, dry and hard plains overgrown with shrubs.
        <br>
        24. Ruins and roads, where herbs grow undisturbed on small hills and mounds raised by plows and human hands.
        <br>
        25. Garden land, which is heavily worked and fertilized by human hands.
        <br> <br>
        Borrowed Locations:
        <br> <br>
        26. When plants do not grow from the soil and draw their nourishment from it through their roots, but instead
        grow on other plants and nourish themselves from them.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 96 .</h3>
        <br /><br />
        Due to reasons that will be explicitly mentioned in §. 99 later, one can reasonably exclude, in the selection of
        characteristics that should make a plant recognizable in the entire plant kingdom, all those properties that do
        not belong to the main concepts of form, position, number, and relationship, such as those that only provide us
        with a sense of one kind without the help of others, like the concepts of taste, smell, and color. In all
        languages, there is a lack of words to clearly and understandably talk about our sensory experiences of this
        kind. One is always forced to speak by comparison, using a body that has the same property, taste, smell, or
        color in a certain degree, and these comparisons often refer to bodies that are not universally known, so such
        expressions are understood only by a few people to whom they are familiar as technical terms.
        <br>
        The plant kingdom, due to the diversity that reigns within it, is particularly rich in bodies that could serve
        as comparisons for such expressions, and one might well find a vegetable body for each of these sensory
        experiences or, so to speak, establish a scale of degrees according to the plant kingdom. However, this
        requires, as is not to be assumed here, a well-developed knowledge of the plant kingdom. Additionally, there is
        a lack of agreement in the judgment of these sensations and in determining what is pleasant and unpleasant about
        them, and for all these reasons, it is hardly possible to categorize the main types of these poorly defined
        sensations, and we will defer the attempts made in this regard until the second part.
      </section>
      <section id="chap4">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Fourth Section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 97 .</h3>

        From the concept of the science that is discussed here, as outlined in §. 2, and from the nature of the means by
        which this science uses to describe the plants, as explained in §. 10, all the rules and teachings of this
        science can be derived with the help of the doctrine of reason. One should therefore refer to the aforementioned
        paragraphs and keep them in mind, as if they were repeated here word for word.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 98 .</h3>
        Since this science is specifically designed to provide the initial knowledge of plants, no prior knowledge that
        requires preliminary investigations and experiences should be assumed. One must focus solely on those properties
        of plants that can be immediately recognized by the senses. Everything related to applied botany and the
        physiology of plants should be deferred for the time being. One must also not necessarily use a magnifying glass
        unless absolutely necessary, and when it is used, it should always be remembered that the investigation must
        begin with the naked eye and only continue with the glass.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 99 .</h3>
        Even less should such properties be chosen as identifying marks that are not consistently present in all
        individual plants of the same species, or perhaps even not in the same plant at all times during its existence.
        For this reason, the identifying marks derived from smell, taste, and color are particularly objectionable, as
        they also suffer from the inconvenience mentioned in §. 96, namely that there is a lack of specific terms and
        expressions to describe them. However, an exception can be made in regard to color, as one can always specify
        the main color, and wild plants, especially those left to nature, do not easily deviate from certain main
        colors. Therefore, it is advisable to note the colors as found in naturally growing plants, since color is most
        appealing to the majority of viewers and is an easily grasped characteristic, as long as it is not used as a
        decisive identifying feature.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 100 .</h3>
        From the consideration that botany should provide the basic knowledge, there follows a significant advantage of
        using those parts and properties of a plant that are present most, if not all, of the time during its existence
        as identifying marks, over those parts that only appear at certain times. If one can rely on the always-present
        characteristics, it would not be necessary to focus on those that are only present for a limited period.
        However, this is not possible, as will become clearer in the following, and one cannot avoid considering the
        plants as they appear during their flowering and fruiting stages because, except for a few, they present all
        parts of their full growth at that time. Additionally, nature has chosen to place the markers of similarity and
        difference between the many species in the reproductive organs, making them distinctive and understandable. One
        cannot reasonably take issue with botany based on this arrangement of nature, and it follows that the first
        basic knowledge of a plant should be obtained when it has reached its complete growth and the development of its
        parts, and that, at the same time, one must make an effort to observe and retain enough characteristics from the
        reproductive organs to recognize the same plant even outside the flowering period. In the meantime, recognizing
        plants based on such indeterminate and secondary marks outside the flowering period is quite difficult, yet in
        many cases, particularly with medicinal herbs, it is necessary. Since nature has also placed very good
        distinguishing features in the other parts of the plant, which do not belong to the reproductive organs, from
        which at least the classes can be determined, features that can be found more thoroughly if one only looks for
        them, it is highly desirable that botanists consider the development of these potential markers more, rather
        than focusing on a somewhat narrow preference for the reproductive organs, as seems to have been the case until
        now.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 101 .</h3>
        When examining any plant in nature that one wishes to identify, one should conclude from the presence of such
        characteristics that make up the botanical description, that the author of the description indeed meant the same
        species of plant that one is now observing in nature. This conclusion can never be brought to a completely
        mathematical certainty. One must be able to assume in this conclusion that there is truly only one species in
        the entire plant kingdom that fits such a description, and the only proof for this assumption is the assurance
        of the botanist, who, based on his comparisons, has determined it so. This is always evidence based on
        experience through induction, which remains incomplete in its fullness as long as there are still unknown plants
        left in nature, and the entire plant kingdom can be viewed from an overlooked perspective. Therefore, it is
        evidence that will never be fully conclusive in the strictest sense. From this consideration, the following
        consequences arise.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 102 .</h3>
        Only a botanist is capable of making a useful description of a plant and specifying its character, not only
        because of the language in which such descriptions must be written, but also due to the consideration of the
        entire plant kingdom, which is necessary when describing and identifying the character of a plant. Without this
        consideration, it cannot be determined what should be included in the description and what should be excluded.
        It is therefore highly desirable that writers who are not botanists, particularly those writing on economics,
        refrain from providing their own descriptions of plants and instead only refer to a reliable botanical book when
        mentioning any plant. In general, it is also advisable for botanists themselves to separate the various branches
        of plant science in their presentations, and when it comes to applied botany or plant physiology, not to teach
        the first historical knowledge later but to establish it in advance.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 103 .</h3>
        The reliability of the characters provided by botanists increases with the number of comparisons they have made
        and with the number of plants that have become known. It is precisely the quantity of known and studied plants
        that gives the knowledge of herbs not just an appearance of superiority but, in essence, an advantage over the
        science of ancient times, and even still today over other parts of natural history. Because we know more plants
        from the entire earth, we also know our native plants better and more reliably than our ancestors did.
        Therefore, it is useful and necessary that more and more plants are sought out and made known, and it is the
        botanists' duty to enrich their catalogs of the plant kingdom. In doing so, they should be spared from the
        question, "What is the use of knowing so many plants, when only a few have practical value?" First of all, it is
        good to know these plants, which were once considered useless, so that they are not confused with other, more
        valued ones; they might, at their time, become valuable for some purpose or another. And if one seeks to
        discover such uses, and does not want to rely solely on chance, one must at least begin with historical
        knowledge.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 104 .</h3>
        The reliability of herb knowledge also increases with the variety of comparisons. Plants, like all works of
        nature, are very complex, very composed, and present many aspects to an attentive observer. The precise
        knowledge of such works of nature does not arise all at once, but grows gradually, and it is impossible for
        humans to make comparisons between plants across the entire plant kingdom in any other way than partially. The
        botanical methods and systems that have emerged over time have provided opportunities for such partial
        examinations of the plant kingdom, and to them, one wrongly attributes the inconveniences that have arisen from
        incidental causes. Without these systems, our understanding of the plant kingdom would still be undeveloped, and
        the differences between plants would be indefinite; furthermore, they will continue to be the guide to
        increasingly precise exploration of the entire kingdom and ever more accurate determination of characters, as
        each new system provides an opportunity to view the entire kingdom from a new perspective, noticing a multitude
        of characteristics, similarities, and differences that would not be noticed without such a stimulus.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 105.</h3>
        Since botanists, in their work of comparing plants with one another and determining the character of each, must
        follow the path of continuous experience or induction, it follows that there is a teaching for them, the
        observation of which removes all the inconveniences that would otherwise arise from the multitude of their
        different systems. Namely, because they must, based on their previous and daily experience, expect that future
        experiences, with new plants that they seek and which will not fail to appear, and with new considerations
        regarding old and new plants, will force them to make daily changes in their concepts of the exact similarities
        of plants, and to daily new combinations. It would therefore be desirable for them to adopt a method that allows
        for the inevitable changes, and not to assign any peculiar names to such changing concepts or combinations, such
        as the so-called genera of herbs, and at least not to expect that these names should hold beyond the context of
        the system and in direct relation to the book in which such a name is listed today, and perhaps changed in the
        next book.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 106.</h3>
        Although the certainty that a given character applies only to one type of plant and not to several within the
        entire kingdom cannot be claimed to be infallible in the strictest sense, there is no reason to harbor mistrust
        toward botany or doubt its reliability. An artful botanical character, as will be seen later, consists of so
        many combined individual traits that the convergence of so many circumstances in several different cases,
        according to all the rules of probability, cannot easily be assumed. Furthermore, the number of truly studied
        plants, especially European ones, is so considerable, and the investigations have been conducted by so many
        botanists with so much diligence and repeated efforts, that the case is unlikely to be found among these.
        However, there is no cause for concern regarding all the still unknown plants, no matter where they grow or wait
        for the discoverer, and as large as their number may seem, because at least the number of new plants that come
        to light at any given time is relatively small compared to the previously known ones, and it does not take long
        before these newcomers are included in the botanists' lists, and improvements to the characters of the
        previously known plants, which these newcomers may inspire, are made.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 107.</h3>
        Moreover, there are means to eliminate the ambiguity that can sometimes slip unnoticed into a character with so
        many traits, as the botanist, in drafting it, is usually focused on brevity and only seeks to include the most
        essential characteristics. These means are generally already available in advance, so that in the event of such
        ambiguity, one can resort to them. These means are descriptions and illustrations. Descriptions provide
        additional characteristics that the botanist may have omitted from the concise character because they did not
        seem like decisive features, but they could become important in a case the botanist had not anticipated.
        Illustrations present all observable characteristics at once, and in one glance, traits whose description in
        words would often require tedious verbosity, often considered unnecessary, but which can decisively resolve
        doubts that unexpectedly arise among people with different concepts and insights.

      <section id="chap5">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Fifth Section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 108.</h3>
        The work of the botanist in compiling his list begins with the determination of species. Plants of a species are
        those that have originated from the same kind and in turn produce offspring of the same kind. This similarity of
        plants is not perfect in the strictest sense, as individual plants of a species can still differ noticeably in
        many respects, or rather, such composite bodies, like plants, must necessarily vary somewhat in their growth
        under the influence of all the elements and countless external conditions. The essence of such a species is
        determined by what is unchangingly present in all plants of the species, while the most notable differences lead
        to variations or subspecies of the same kind.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 109.</h3>
        The origin of variations is generally influenced by external circumstances, especially the difference in soil,
        and nature itself produces many of them. However, they primarily arise through human intervention, and they are
        most often noticed and observed in significant variations in those plant species that humans cultivate. These
        variations also disappear in proportion to the degree to which humans withdraw their involvement, but generally
        only gradually, not suddenly. One must assume that they emerged in this way, although the exact stages of their
        emergence cannot be specified. Usually, the effort that humans put into the cultivation of plants is rewarded by
        an improvement in their suitability for human purposes. The duration of these variations can last for several
        generations; however, they generally persist less, or not at all, through seed propagation and last longer when
        propagated by offshoots separated from the mother plant.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Fünfter Abschnitt.</h2>
        <h3>§. 110.</h3>
        There is no doubt that the changes to the stamens and pistils can contribute significantly to the origin of
        variations, and flower enthusiasts are well aware of the effect that the mixing of pollen from different flowers
        can have on the colors. However, in more recent times, in botanical gardens, which have become more frequent and
        where many plants, previously isolated across the Earth, now grow near each other, and during investigations
        prompted by the study of plant genera, something even more noteworthy has been observed. It has been noticed
        that through the mixing of plants from different genera and entirely different species, entirely new or hybrid
        species can arise, which are capable of reproducing their kind—something that is more notable than in the animal
        kingdom with hybrids. The hypothesis has emerged that not only many recognized forms of true variants, but also
        those we regard as variants—even if they maintain their particular structure from generation to generation—might
        be able to arise this way. In fact, even many species that we regard as true species, despite finding their
        difference from other subspecies negligible, could have originated in this way. Therefore, there may be species
        that have not always existed since the beginning of creation, but are of more recent origin, and that at least
        not all variations can be traced to differences in soil, cultivation, and other external conditions. However,
        the generation of these hybrid species is a matter for which many investigations are still needed before
        definite principles can be established.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 111.</h3>
        Meanwhile, these variations, and even the emergence of hybrid species, if confirmed, are far from a
        transformation of plants, as many have proposed in our times. The variations remain very similar to their main
        species, and the hybrid species always remain very similar to their probable parent species, more so than to any
        foreign species. Even if we concede a large role to external conditions in the growth of plants, it must still
        be the case that as long as the organic structure and vegetative power, which existed previously in the seed or
        the germ and which nature has designed to produce the same kind, is not entirely suppressed—wherein no growth,
        or only a deformity, arises—the development and growth of the young plant must necessarily follow this
        organization. The results of this organization, too, will follow suit. Therefore, it must certainly be the case
        that anything arising from this will be a plant that is more similar to the original species than to any
        completely different species, as the established experience shows that plants of recognized species only arise
        from their own seeds. Farmers, who are so eager to rely on their supposed experiences of actual transformations,
        and believe that the theory of botanists must not apply, fail to consider that they are in fact disputing the
        most common and reliable experiences in nature, which teach us that plants are produced from certain seeds. They
        fail to recognize that what they regard as an indifferent theory is, in fact, the consistency of the form
        prescribed by the Creator to the creatures, the foundation of all knowledge. When they, as is commonly the case,
        regard various species, for example, all grain species, as mere variations of a primary species, they fail to
        see a clear lack of insight and attention, which is necessary for such important experiences. Their alleged
        experiences, where certain plants in their fields fail to grow at certain times while others appear without
        being sown, prove nothing further than the fact that it is not always possible to demonstrate historically how
        and when the seed of many plants arrived at a place where it was not expected. However, we know that the paths
        of seed dispersal are countless, and that many seeds, under certain circumstances, can lie dormant in the soil
        for a long time without losing their vitality. Why do such transformations not occur in botanical gardens, where
        different species of plants are found by the thousands? And why do they only occur under the hands of farmers
        who work with so few species? Why does a supposed transformation always lead to a common species in agriculture,
        and never to a species unusual to farmers?
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 112.</h3>
        Experience must determine what constitutes a species and a variety, and this through a twofold process: through
        the revelation of the origin and the reversion. The origin is seen when we observe plants that are clearly
        unlike their parent species and notice how this or that variety emerges from its main species. The reversion is
        observed when we see how such plants shed the characteristic that made their parent species a variety and return
        to the common form of the main species. From this arises the necessity for botanists to conduct as many of these
        observations as possible, and to multiply the opportunities for such through changed experiments. This also
        provides further proof of the necessity for botanists who take on such work for the benefit of others, and proof
        of the usefulness of botanical gardens, among other things, for this purpose.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 113.</h3>
        The errors that occur when incorrectly determining species and varieties, and their consequences, come down to
        the following: Whoever considers a variety to be a true, essentially unchangeable species has based the
        determination of a plant on a variable characteristic that they found only in certain plants they encountered by
        chance. Another person, based on the description, might search in vain, and thus, when they come across a
        different plant of the same species, they are misled to conclude that it is entirely different due to the
        absence of the indicated misleading characteristic. On the other hand, whoever considers a true species to be a
        mere variety of another species causes two fundamentally different things to be regarded as one and the same.
        This error has worse consequences and is less tolerable than the reverse because it opens the way for unfounded
        attribution of powers and effects and destroys real entities by erasing their memory as true species. In
        general, the plants that humans engage with in land and garden cultivation are mostly varieties of original
        species found growing wild in nature. These improved varieties deserve attention for their many commendable
        traits. Therefore, they should not be forgotten in botanical catalogs, but properly ordered and noted with their
        specific, albeit variable, characteristics. Even if the error occurs where a variety is temporarily considered a
        true species, it will always be listed next to its true parent species in all catalogs. The error will not
        remain uncorrected for long due to the persistent diligence of botanists. In the meantime, however, the memory
        of a variety will be preserved, the knowledge of which is often more important than the knowledge of many true
        species.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 114.</h3>
        However, one does not always have immediate access to the experience that should definitively determine what
        constitutes a species and what a variety is. In such cases, the botanist must rely on assumptions. The reasons
        for these assumptions are derived from general observations made from experience about what is typically
        variable in the plants of a species and thus indicates varieties. They are mainly based on those observations
        made in regard to each main class of the plant kingdom, for a factor that may seem significant or insignificant
        in one class may not be so in all classes. General observations about the entire plant kingdom generally suggest
        that differences in odor, taste, color, smoothness or roughness, and other properties of the surface, in the
        division or indivisibility of the leaves, their curling, and other similar traits, are circumstances that are
        insufficient to make the plants they occur in more than varieties. Observations on what is particularly variable
        within the plants of a species in each class belong in a catalog of the plant kingdom. Now, when the botanist
        faces uncertainty about whether a plant should be considered a true species or merely a variety, he must decide
        according to the likelihood of the aforementioned observations. However, he should not forget that these are
        only assumptions. Thus, when dealing with a variety that might turn out to be a true species after further
        experience, or with a species that might be concluded to be nothing more than a variety, he should add a note
        indicating the uncertainty.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 115.</h3>
        The next step in the botanist’s work, in organizing thoughts, is to arrange the correctly identified species in
        relation to each other. All organization consists in the connection of the similar and the separation of the
        dissimilar, according to the different levels of similarity, which divides the entire collection of things to be
        organized into larger and smaller groups or collections, which together make up the whole. At each level of
        classification, the collections formed are each given certain distinguishing characteristics, which may not be
        found in the neighboring collections, but all smaller collections that have originated from a main collection
        must share the common characteristics of the higher collection, despite their differences.
        <br>
        When everything is arranged in proper order, the key to the organization is presented, namely, the headings of
        the divisions or the characteristics by which each collection differs from its sub-collections. These headings
        are then compared with each item taken into hand, which is suspected to belong to one of the collections, and
        either it is found or it is demonstrated that, despite the assumption, it does not belong under that heading.
        This process is carried out under the assumption that each item has been placed correctly in its proper place
        according to the headings.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 116.</h3>
        One can give these different collections names to indicate the levels of division, and there should be as many
        names as there are levels. However, in general, three should be enough to note the upper, lower, and middle
        divisions (Genus summum, medium, infimum), which is also common in botany, as the terms class, order, genus
        (Classis, Ordo, Genus) have been introduced, and in cases with more levels, some intermediate divisions may
        remain unnamed.
        <br>
        Thus, the genera are the smallest collections of the lowest divisions, where botanists are not inclined to make
        further subdivisions, or where they find no sufficient reason to do so, but believe that the species united
        under a genus have the most exact similarity with each other.
        <br>
        What the species are to the genera, the genera are to the orders, and so on in descending order. In the same
        way, the varieties and individual plants relate to the species, with the difference that the concepts of species
        are necessary, unchangeable, and determined by nature itself, beyond dispute, and can only be decided by
        experience. On the other hand, the concepts of all collections of species, from the smallest and least to the
        largest and first, are variable and depend on the different perspective under which each botanist views the
        plants, on what they primarily seek in terms of similarity and dissimilarity, on their judgment and decision
        regarding how many characteristics should be included in the definition of a genus or in the determination of
        several collections, and finally, on the number of known plants and forms of organic structure.
        <br>
        To claim that a collection of species, no matter how similar the species within it may appear, will always
        remain unchanged and retain its boundaries, one would have to be certain that no new species would emerge, even
        among those yet undiscovered, that would show a closer relationship or a more exact similarity to one or more of
        the species already in that genus. For, as experience shows us every day, such cases do occur, and the botanist
        is obliged to follow better insights. Thus, one or another species will soon move out of this genus or that and
        have to join with the new arrivals, forming new genera, or the new species will find their place in the old
        genera, forcing the boundaries of these genera to be altered. It is even possible that some old genera will
        dissolve entirely and cease to exist due to the loss of all their species.
        <br>
        If all the particular forms of organic structure that the Creator of the plant kingdom has seen fit to implement
        were known to us in advance, we could determine the genera unchangeably, provided that we were capable of
        clearly comprehending them. However, we only come to recognize these forms gradually, by continuous
        approximation.

        <h2>Sixth Section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 117.</h3>
        The order in which a botanist organizes the plant kingdom is called their system or method, which, in literal
        terms, refers to their way or manner of proceeding. The headings of the divisions are called the key to the
        method.
        <br>
        The one who uses the botanist's catalog and follows the prescribed system as a guide, compares a plant in nature
        to the key of the method, moving from the upper division to the lower division, until they find the desired
        species in the appropriate division or genus. However, the author of a system can follow two completely
        different paths in its construction, which we will call the path of division and the path of combination.
        Namely, they can first design a plan for the plant kingdom according to their own judgment and proceed from the
        upper division to the lower division, assigning each plant a place according to the established rules, and this
        is the path of division, where the key is made first; or they can first group the species into collections as
        they naturally find them, then combine smaller collections into larger ones, which ultimately make up the entire
        plant kingdom, thus moving from the lower divisions to the upper ones, and this is the path of combination,
        where the key is made last. It is easy to see that methods based on division are arbitrary and must force nature
        to conform, which is why they are called methods of arbitrariness or artifice (Methodus artificialis). In
        methods based on combination, the similarities are taken as they are found, and nature is followed, which is why
        they are appropriately called natural methods; however, despite all their advantages, they still have so many
        flaws that none should rightly be called a plan of nature.
        <br>
        Before the advantages and inconveniences of each of these paths can be discussed in more detail, we must first
        examine the similarities in their levels and the most convenient means of combining species into collections.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 118.</h3>
        The levels of similarity are measured by the number and nature of the individual characteristics that the things
        being compared have in common.
        <br>
        Once someone has a rough outline of the entire plant kingdom in their memory or before their eyes, whether it is
        their own design or one learned from a comprehensive study of nature, they will, when observing any individual
        plant in nature, first be directed to those properties that relate to this outline. These are the properties
        that are present in all plants of a class, albeit in certain specific degrees or modifications, so that the
        concept of one modification necessarily involves the concept of its opposite; and such properties serve as
        relative characteristics, and a character composed of such characteristics is a relative character.
        <br>
        However, one notices in many herbs also such properties that the related herbs and neighbors in a class do not
        have, neither in lesser nor greater degrees, nor their opposites, which therefore do not relate to the assumed
        outline but are foreign to it, and these are peculiar characteristics, Nota essentialis.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 119.</h3>
        It should be immediately noted that, in most cases, such a peculiar characteristic alone can be sufficient to
        define the character of a species or genus, whereas a relative characteristic rarely suffices on its own to form
        a complete character, and several must always be combined. Apart from this brevity, these peculiar
        characteristics also have the advantage of always being displayed in the same way, regardless of which side the
        plant is viewed from. They thus fit into all systems and are expressed in the same manner, whereas relative
        characteristics differ according to each method. On the other hand, relative characteristics have the advantage
        that, although they are not as concise and not as easily imprinted in memory, they are, in contrast, more
        enduring. Even if they fade from memory, they can be more easily renewed and restored because all these relative
        ideas, all these characteristics placed in a necessary connection with one another, support each other, and one
        provides the basis for the restoration of the other, as long as the entire outline has not disappeared from
        memory.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 120.</h3>
        Another consideration leads us to distinguish between fluctuating and consistent characteristics. Namely, when
        one examines any true natural class of plants, whose general similarity is undeniably apparent, in closer detail
        according to individual characteristics, one finds that each of these characteristics, although present in most
        species of the class, may be missing in one or another species, and that only a few characteristics are present
        in all species of the class without exception. Furthermore, when comparing the same class with other related
        natural classes, one finds these fluctuating characteristics again in combination with other properties that are
        entirely absent in the first class.
        <br>
        It is also notable here how the profound artistry of nature is reflected in the varied connections of the parts
        with each other and with the whole. Nature has established relationships between the classes of the plant
        kingdom on all sides, thereby creating insurmountable difficulties for all botanical systems that only indicate
        relationships in ascending and descending lines. And given that we are everywhere justified in saying that for
        our purposes, for distinguishing plants, we need systems based on the obvious structure, and considering this
        structure as the basis of nature's plan, we still have little hope of detaching nature's supposed plan for the
        plant kingdom, which she has indeed placed too deeply for us to uncover.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 121.</h3>
        The main law of similarity and the fundamental principle of all good methods is this: "No plants should be
        grouped together because of a similarity in one or another characteristic alone, when there is otherwise great
        difference in several other characteristics, and no plant should be separated from others because of a
        difference in one or another characteristic, when there is otherwise great similarity in most aspects."
        <br>
        An addition to this law is: "A consistent characteristic within a class, used to determine its character, is
        more important than all fluctuating characteristics taken together."
        <br>
        Another consequence of the previous observations is this: "The more a method aligns with nature, and leaves true
        similarities undisturbed, the more the difference between relative and characteristic traits will disappear.
        These characteristic traits will, in such a method, be connected with the same fundamental structure and thus
        assume the nature of relative traits."

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 122.</h3>
        In regard to the means of connecting species in collections, the prevailing opinion in our time is that the
        foundation of all methods must be derived from the fruiting organs, excluding those parts of the plant structure
        that are considered contrary to the fruiting organs.
        <br>
        However, if we examine this opinion with due respect for its great and deserving defenders, but without
        prejudice, we may find that it is not entirely proven. No one has yet thought of establishing a method in the
        animal kingdom based on the parts designated for reproduction, and moral repulsion against such a method may
        indeed continue to prevent such an idea, at least until naturalists lack other foundations for their methods.
        <br>
        Meanwhile, if overwhelming reasons existed, a naturalist would be no more hindered by moral considerations than
        the dissector, and like him, he should tell his students that nothing in nature is contemptible, and that what
        is offensive lies only in the corrupt heart and imagination. With this due seriousness and respect for nature
        and manners, a zoologist cannot avoid noticing the differences that nature has introduced into the parts of the
        animal kingdom.
        <br>
        If in botany, the fruiting organs are to be highly regarded because they are considered particularly essential,
        are the parts of the animal structure designated for the same purpose less essential? And if, as we see, the
        animal kingdom can be organized without regard to these parts, why should we be bound in the plant kingdom to
        focus solely on them?
        <br>
        Can we not be misled by vague concepts when using the term "essential"? A part of the organic structure may be
        more or less dispensable for the continuation of the life of an individual creature, but can any part
        justifiably be called more essential than any other? Does not the lion's claw belong to the concept of its
        essence just as much as its head? If the Earth, as it is inhabited by fragile creatures, were to remain as it
        is, these creatures must be able to reproduce, but does this mean that reproduction is the primary purpose of
        their existence?
        <br>
        If we conceptually divide the organic structure of plants into two main parts, the core and the shell, and if we
        want to place the essence of life in the core, both parts are inseparable companions in themselves. Both are
        modified by nature in many ways, and their various modifications contain both the similarities and differences
        that define the classes of the plant kingdom.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 123.</h3>
        In light of such considerations, which belong to the physiology of plants, whose presentation is too early in
        fundamental botany, the point here is to take the characteristics of similarities and dissimilarities as one
        finds them, whether in any part of the organic structure, as it comes down to appearance and experience to
        decide which characteristics lead the furthest.
        <br>
        All the advantage that the fruiting organs may have does not lie in the fact that they are the tools of
        reproduction, but solely in a convenience found therein. At the time of fructification, plants generally show
        their parts completely, the fruiting organs are numerous, and their modifications are many, so they provide a
        large number of characteristics. They are also generally easier to abstract than the characteristics related to
        appearance. For this reason, the fruiting organs were greatly preferred when botanical gardens were first
        established, and plants began to be studied with more leisure and care than was possible for the early
        botanists, who had to select plants from the vastness of nature's wilderness. When systems began to be
        considered, they truly did not take into account how a convenient and lasting observation could be achieved.
        These early botanists mainly relied on the parts of plants that were always present, particularly the form and
        outline, which was the least significant among all their characteristics.
        <br>
        Thus, when compared with the early botanists, the fruiting organs were much more accessible, and it became quite
        natural to look down on the parts of plants that they had been so unsuccessful with, leading to the later belief
        that evidence from physiology could be used to justify this disregard.
        <br>
        Now that methods based on the fruiting parts have been thoroughly explored, and in the pursuit of discovering a
        natural method, whose gaps certainly cannot be filled without considering the appearance of plants, it can be
        expected that more care will be given to the characteristics seen in the plants. It will then become evident
        that many such characteristics go much further than those based on the fruiting organs alone. It is likely that
        there will be agreement that, in order to discover the true affinities within the plant kingdom, the entire
        organic structure, in its full extent, must be taken into account without excluding any part. More comprehensive
        insights into what appearance involves are to be desired, especially for the important reason, as mentioned
        earlier (§ 100), that in many cases, knowledge of plants outside of flowering time is highly relevant.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 124.</h3>
        As already mentioned in § 99, one should limit oneself, by excluding such characteristics of plants that are
        either changeable or cannot be clearly described with words, to the characteristics that fall under the main
        concepts of number and proportion, shape and position. However, even these are not of equal importance when
        determining affinities: proportion goes further than number, and in terms of shape, the outer outline alone does
        not matter much, but the substance and tissue, along with the position and connection of the parts with each
        other, decide the most.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 125.</h3>
        The final divisions in the method are the genera (§ 117), concerning which there is much to remember and
        consider when establishing and defining them. They generally have the same structure as the method to which they
        belong. It follows that in arbitrary methods, where the entire plan is adopted from the beginning according to
        personal preference, the final divisions will least likely align with nature. This is because the deviations of
        such a plan from nature will become increasingly noticeable as the method is more carefully executed. In an
        arbitrary method, one will find no sufficient reason to maintain the divisions until reaching the individual
        species. It is indeed better to carry out an arbitrary method in the so-called synoptic table form, up to the
        individual species, according to the principles of the plan, rather than leaving unnatural collections of
        species under the name of genera.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 126.</h3>
        In a natural method, where one is guided by nature, the genera will indeed align with nature, but only insofar
        as our understanding of the affinities of plants extends, and this understanding is never complete, as mentioned
        in § 116. Not only are there many plants that cannot be placed in any of the recognized natural classes, and
        which we must therefore consider as fragments of still unknown classes, but when we examine each of the
        recognized classes individually and make divisions within them—something we must do to facilitate science—we
        encounter great difficulties and a lack of sufficient grounds, which must be compensated by arbitrariness and
        unilateral decisions. We can certainly show and prove beyond dispute that certain plants belong to a particular
        class, but we cannot say with the same certainty which of them must be grouped into an order or genus. Often, it
        takes only a small difference for botanists to separate a few closely related species into different genera, and
        often, despite many and large structural differences—which some authors of methods would consider
        characteristics of entire classes—several species are still kept together in one genus. Some genera could form
        an order or class on their own, and some weak genera might merge. In short, no immutable collections of species
        can be made, whether under the name of class, order, or genus, nor can fixed concepts of relationships be
        established. Botanists could admit this without detriment to science or their own merit, and science would gain
        much by it. However, do not misunderstand me: I do not deny the affinities of plants; I only say that their
        boundaries are indeterminate. I do not say that botanists should not create classes, orders, and genera, for
        that is precisely what all systems are based on, but rather that they should not regard them as more than what
        they are—concepts that are subject to continual expansion, restriction, and even upheaval. Thus, one should
        adopt a method that allows for foreseeable changes in such a way that no harm is done later, and science would
        gain much from this, as it would be freed from the burden of many names for the same plant, a proliferation of
        names that originates from the source mentioned. Furthermore, more will be said about this in § 140. Here, I
        only want to recall, regarding the repeatedly raised question in writings, whether one should give genera a
        large or small scope, whether one should create many or few of them, that if all genera a botanist adopts—not
        only the higher and middle ones, i.e., classes and orders, but also the lower genera, or so-called genera—should
        each have its own proper name, it would indeed be desirable for these genera to have a broad scope and to be few
        in number, because then the cases in which a plant must move from one genus to another, where it would receive a
        new name each time, would be less frequent.

      <section id="chap7">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Seventh Section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 127.</h3>
        In arbitrary methods, one must indeed give up the claim to preserve affinities, but they have other advantages
        and are indispensable for beginners, as well as for botanists themselves in more thorough investigations of the
        plant kingdom. The examination of the plant kingdom, such a vast and highly interconnected body, cannot be
        undertaken in any other way than partially. One must have a plan for all continuous work, and thus the plan of
        an arbitrary method can be adopted. Each such method provides an opportunity to view the plant kingdom from a
        previously overlooked perspective; it shows how far each main part of the organic structure extends and what
        characteristics nature has embedded in each. It always leads to some discoveries regarding affinities and the
        natural classes, orders, or genera based upon them, which one would otherwise not have considered. All methods
        established and implemented by botanists from time to time have provided this benefit, and without them, science
        would not have reached its current degree of perfection. The inconveniences that have arisen alongside them do
        not stem from the essence of the methods themselves or from their inherent nature but from secondary
        causes—namely, the fact that these methods were regarded as more than what they are, namely, mere frameworks for
        a building yet to be erected, and not the building itself. Every founder of a method was eager to create a sect,
        and with each new method came new names for the plants. These inconveniences could, indeed, almost outweigh the
        benefits of the methods themselves.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 128.</h3>
        However, if one avoids these errors and does not exaggerate the demands when using an arbitrary method, the
        majority of methods cause no harm and do not even prove burdensome to a beginner. Instead, the beginner learns
        to understand and use them with some effort, depending on the circumstances. Namely, one follows the method as
        long as one holds a book or catalog arranged according to it, and then puts the method aside with the book,
        without burdening the memory with the headings of all its divisions, which would be as unreasonable a demand as
        if any other author were to require that one memorize the headings of the chapters or sections of their book.
        Since the keys to all methods are written in the common language of botanists, which every lover of the science
        must learn and know, they use the key of each method and read the headings of its divisions, just as they would
        read any book in a familiar language. If only botanists could agree on the names of the plants, then the
        enthusiast, who investigates a plant in nature according to this or that method or according to several methods
        simultaneously, would always find the same name at the place where the investigated plant belongs in each
        method. Once the enthusiast has acquired knowledge of the plant and has engraved this name in their memory, it
        will matter little which path they took to reach this knowledge, and they will not always have to think about
        the path itself.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 129.</h3>
        Moreover, a beginner is not sufficiently aided by a single arbitrary method and its one-sided use alone; the use
        of several such methods is almost indispensable. For if, in the plant he wishes to examine, the part on which
        the method is based is not present, or is no longer in a good and recognizable condition, he finds himself in
        difficulty. Additionally, when applying a method, there are always some difficulties, especially for a beginner,
        and if in such cases he can resort to another method, his doubts will, most likely, be resolved.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 130.</h3>
        The great advantage of arbitrary methods lies in the fact that in the plan of such a method, the most precise
        connection can be made, that the headings of the divisions can be formulated using purely relative terms, that
        the key can be provided in clear and precise expressions, and that once the rules of the method are adopted,
        exceptions can be avoided if one simply chooses to follow them, without concerning oneself with whether the
        affinities of the plants are disturbed or not. The main purpose in executing such a method must be directed at
        teaching a beginner, assuming that they have no prior knowledge of plants. If, with the help of such a method,
        the beginner can reliably identify a plant, even if only through a few characteristics, even if only from one
        perspective, and without insight into its relationships and similarities with other plants, this is enough as a
        starting point. The key is to make the beginning easy, and if one could and would anticipate the similarities of
        plants, then one could do without the guide of arbitrary methods everywhere. Therefore, it is advisable to
        strictly follow the adopted rules, and place each plant exactly in the position it deserves according to the
        rules of the method.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 131.</h3>
        As mentioned, the knowledge that an arbitrary method leads to is good enough as a starting point, but a thorough
        understanding of the plant kingdom is only achieved when one learns to comprehend the affinities that natural
        methods reveal. In general, all knowledge is more enlightening and convincing when seen in context, and it
        leaves a deeper impression on the memory. By getting to know plants from more than one perspective, from several
        characteristics, one retains an unforgettable image of them in the memory. Once one becomes somewhat familiar
        with the natural classes, the guide of arbitrary methods becomes unnecessary in most cases. One becomes
        accustomed to associating a plant with its relatives at first glance, and is able to, at any time during its
        existence, if almost all arbitrary methods are unavailable, at least deduce its class.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 132.</h3>
        The greatest encouragement for the exploration of affinities comes from the idea that with a similarity in the
        structure of plants, there follows a similarity in their powers and effects. This idea, although frequently
        contested, nevertheless presents an initial appeal, holding the analogy in high regard and can at least be
        considered a highly plausible assumption if we are to truly understand each other.
        <br>
        For example, the effect of plants on the human body must not be judged solely by their harmful or beneficial
        qualities, because the same substance can be harmful or beneficial at different times, without any change in its
        nature, only through a change in the degree or the varying nature of the body in which it is applied. Thus, if
        in a natural class, some herbs are medicinal while others are poisonous to the human body, it does not prevent
        the possibility that their powers, in terms of their nature, might be similar.
        <br><br>
        Likewise, one should not adhere to the phrases introduced in medical textbooks when discussing the observable
        effects in the body or the presumed mechanisms of action. The first type of expression determines nothing about
        the method by which the resulting effect is achieved; from the second type, it is important to note that much of
        it is so vague that even those who use it often have difficulty providing clear definitions of the concepts they
        are referring to, and proving the accuracy of these assumptions is even more challenging.
        <br>
        One must also be cautious when attempting to use examples from a class that is thought to be natural to argue
        against the validity of this assumption. It is always important to question whether a class truly is a natural
        class, and one must ask whether the lack of similarity in its powers might actually suggest doubt about its
        correct classification, because the undeniable and generally accepted natural classes clearly show a strong
        similarity in their scent and taste.
        <br>
        Furthermore, objections should not be based on the difficulty we face in abstracting the similarity in powers or
        in representing the specific components, because the works of nature are too fine for our insights, for our
        senses, and for the treatment of chemistry. Therefore, the similarity we cannot grasp might still exist, and our
        assumption about it might still be correct. For us, who have weaker senses than many animals and no instinct,
        the example of animals is irrefutable; they are guided in their choice of food by smell and taste, which
        strongly suggests that the impressions of plant bodies on smell and taste give significant indications of their
        powers and components.
        <br>
        We understand the mechanics of organic bodies too little, but we can hardly imagine anything other than that the
        components and juices of plants are primarily the result of their organic structure. We cannot imagine an
        external similarity without an internal one, and thus we are inclined to accept the assumption discussed here,
        which is supported by analogy and experience in the animal kingdom. For we can still recognize the main class
        even in the foods that are so greatly altered and unrecognizable in the particles of animal bodies.
        <br>
        One cannot avoid at least wishing that the assumption is true, because it provides a guide for the investigation
        of the value of herbs. If we do not want to rely entirely on chance, we must use hypotheses, and hypotheses
        require a guide.
        <br>
        All harm that the assumption could cause through improper application can be prevented if we remember that the
        results of this assumption should be considered nothing more than conjectures, which must only be confirmed
        through careful experience by physicians, specialists, and all those involved with plants in the context of
        human life.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 133.</h3>
        The author of a natural method has the ability to observe similarities without disturbance, but it is much
        harder to establish a connection between the natural collections, to devise a uniform plan. Some numerous
        classes have a clear character, but they cannot be separated into equally clear subdivisions. Many classes are
        clearly related, but the relationship is based on very different things, making it impossible to group them into
        any upper division. Thus, the key to the method will either lack coherence, or the connection will be achieved
        through far-fetched comparisons that no beginner can comprehend, nor understand the terminology, and which will
        miss the clarity that comes with a plan woven from relative concepts.
        <br>
        If there were a method whose key consisted of such relative expressions, and at the same time left the
        similarities undisturbed, such a method would have to be considered a true plan of nature, just as one who
        deciphers a hidden script and derives a coherent meaning to which all parts and letters fit, undoubtedly has
        found the meaning of its author and the true key. The lack of clarity in the key of so-called natural methods
        makes them unpopular with beginners, and they only come to appreciate them when they have gained some insight
        into the plant kingdom and can dispense with the keys in most cases.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 134.</h3>
        The founders of the botanical methods established from time to time are well aware of the inconveniences arising
        from both division and combination. There are only a few strict arbitrary methods, and most are mixed. On the
        one hand, they have provided beginners with an indispensable guide through the clarity of the plan and its key,
        but on the other hand, they have not wanted to completely force nature. You can see in these mixed methods that
        their authors primarily aimed to preserve certain generally recognized major classes, and the plan had to
        accommodate this. Alongside these preserved natural classes, sometimes an arbitrary class or order is placed in
        the system, whose existence owes more to an occasion taken from the natural class than to the consequences of
        the plan. Indeed, in many methods, the rules of the method have even been adjusted to respect the similarity,
        and some plants have been placed with their relatives in positions where they should not be according to the
        design of the method. This is not justifiable, because the primary advantage of arbitrary methods—the clear
        guidance for beginners—would be lost.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 135.</h3>
        In reality, it is most advisable to combine both methods in a botanical directory, but not in a method. Namely,
        one can first arrange and list the plants that are to be included in the directory according to their
        affinities, based on the best understanding available at the time. It is equally fine to completely forgo a
        systematic connection and initially include the recognized natural classes, then the still undefined classes or
        smaller genera, as mere fragments, with no relationship to each other. For each plant, one can state what is
        known and mark each with a number in a continuous numerical sequence. Then, arbitrary methods can be used as
        registers over the previous directory, each executed according to its rules, and for each plant in the
        directory, the corresponding number in each method can be listed to refer the reader back to the directory.
        These registers will take up no more space than other good registers in a book. The use of multiple arbitrary
        methods, according to different parts of the organic structure, will assist a beginner at any stage of a plant's
        existence. The deciphering of multiple methods, all leading back to the same number in the directory, will
        provide them with greater certainty, and in the directory, they will ultimately learn to recognize the plant in
        relation to other plants. The arbitrary methods serve as a first discovery of a plant, while the directory
        according to affinities helps retain a thorough understanding of it in memory.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 136.</h3>
        The division of numerous natural classes is somewhat similar to the overall organization of the plant kingdom.
        For some of these classes, there are specific methods that embody the general properties of methods in
        themselves. This division can be approached most efficiently, and with benefits for beginners, in a manner
        similar to that described in the previous paragraph, as follows: one creates a list of the species of such a
        class, arranges them in the most natural way possible, and assigns numbers to them. One also develops, according
        to the character of the class, a guideline for a detailed examination of each plant within the class, where the
        most remarkable characteristics are clearly indicated under prominent headings, and under each heading, the
        corresponding species are recorded. The advantage here is that one is not limited to focusing on just one part
        of the structure, as is typically the case in these specific methods, but instead, with this guideline, one can
        point out everything significant within the entire class.

        <h2>Eighth Section.</h2>
        <h3>§. 137.</h3>
        Now we can essentially imagine the botanist's catalog as being complete, namely, one that contains the correctly
        indicated characteristics of the plants in a convenient order, and where nothing is left to do except to attach
        the most useful aids and the most practical information.
        <br>
        The aids are descriptions and illustrations, whose usefulness has already been explained in §. 107. It is
        advisable to give the catalog the form of a manual and, in this way, to make a book out of the descriptions. The
        main rule in writing the descriptions is to include nothing that does not belong to the subject, but to measure
        carefully what does belong, namely, a precise knowledge of both the general and the particular in the plant
        kingdom, and in each class, specifically. See §. 102.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 138.</h3>
        The illustrations are, according to their purpose, of two kinds: true or, to some extent, individual
        illustrations, where the intention is limited to what is depicted, and ideas or representations to explain
        abstract concepts. The latter kind consists of figures to clarify terminology and the various plant genera
        established by botanists. An abstract concept cannot be painted; these figures are only examples that contribute
        as much as individual cases and modifications can, and one must choose the most significant, clearest, and at
        the same time most common examples.
        <br>
        The individual illustrations are intended as monuments of the plants they represent. They must be faithful and
        instructive, and they cannot be both without being beautiful, just as an artist from whom such works are
        expected must have some knowledge of both the general and the specific in the plant kingdom. They should contain
        as much as possible of everything that can be depicted, not only the contour but also the substance, the texture
        of the surface, and the features placed on it. Small objects that the naked eye cannot discern clearly, or whose
        natural size is too small for the artist's hand to handle, must be drawn with the help of a magnifying glass,
        but must always be depicted as they appear to the naked eye. Large plants, which exceed the prescribed space,
        can be shown in a reduced size for their whole body, and individual parts in their natural size. Parts of the
        plants that are of particular interest and do not naturally appear in their normal state must be shown
        separately.
        <br>
        When the illustrations are as they should be, they are an immense aid and a true support of science. It is true
        that they are not of absolute necessity; one can manage with a literal presentation without illustrations, but
        not the other way around. It is advisable that the botanist describes plants as if no illustrations were
        available or to be hoped for. However, it is also true that a good illustration shows what a more detailed
        description, which would necessarily be long-winded and slow, conveys much more quickly and in one glance, and
        cannot be compared to a deficient description. Moreover, all inconveniences in synonymy in botany arising from
        incomplete descriptions are avoided when one can refer to a good illustration.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 139.</h3>
        The information that belongs in the botanist's directory primarily consists of citations from other writings,
        names, and, among the annotations on usefulness and remarkable properties, only the most carefully selected
        ones. In general, the directory allows little space for such annotations, and the study of the uses and benefits
        of plants must be treated as a separate part of the entire science. However, since the plants that have
        particularly attracted human attention are also specially noted in the directory, a beginner is immediately
        directed toward the most useful ones, which limitation, given the large number of plants, is as pleasant as it
        is useful.
        <br>
        By citing synonyms, the botanist makes their directory simultaneously a register of the book of nature and of
        human books. Other writings contain many explanations of the book of nature, for which the botanist has no room;
        the agreement of several writers in the history of a plant grants it more reliability. It is pleasant to see how
        much has been known or not known at any given time. It is only fair to maintain the deserved fame of the
        researchers who first brought a plant before the eyes of humanity, even if we may now know such a plant better.
        Other writers of every era have oriented themselves toward the botanists of their time, and to understand their
        reports on the usefulness and use of plants, it is necessary for us to understand those earlier botanists. Based
        on this, it is easy to assess which writers deserve to be cited in the synonymy, namely those who have explained
        the book of nature or the specific history of a plant through an illustration, description, or the determination
        of a characteristic, or have provided other important information about it. However, we care little for those
        who have done nothing more than name a known plant, have merely included it in their directory, or who have
        lacked the necessary clarity and want to be deciphered. Time will be better spent on the inexhaustible book of
        nature.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 140.</h3>
        The botanists must hear many complaints about the multiplicity of names, and it is certain that this makes the
        science burdensome and unpleasant, hindering its broader dissemination, through which it should become more
        generally useful. For this reason, it deserves careful consideration. One can view names in terms of the
        concepts they evoke and in terms of the purpose of their use.
        <br>
        Recall the note in §3, according to which the concept of a plant is either developed or undeveloped according to
        the guidance of science. Let us, for a while, call the name of a developed concept a relative name, and the name
        for an undeveloped concept an independent name.
        <br>
        The purpose of using a name is either directed towards general usage or towards a more restricted use among
        botanists. Or, to put it differently, the name by which a botanist designates a plant should either only apply
        within the book or also outside it—be it a common name or a botanical systematic name.
        <br>
        The use of a name outside the book necessarily presupposes a concept of the thing it indicates in memory.
        However, when the book is in hand, it can serve as a guide to acquiring the concept that is not yet present. In
        this case, it only serves as much as referring to a page and section of the book would.
        <br>
        Even a botanist, when mentioning or hearing the name of a plant, and not explicitly engaged in scientific
        discourse, does not always form a clear concept, but contently settles for an undeveloped concept, as the memory
        provides it quickly. It is always unreasonable for human operations to require developed concepts and clear
        notions of things in their entirety, unless one specifically intends to do so. Instead, one is content, and can
        be content, if only the aspect of a thing from which one views it is clear, according to the circumstances. One
        must be able to speak of plants without always having the botanical system in mind, and the names must be
        independent names.
        <br>
        Admittedly, relative names may become so familiar to someone accustomed to the system they refer to, and who has
        learned the botanist's book by heart, that upon hearing such a name, they form a quick notion of what is needed
        for tasks outside botany. But this requires, as mentioned, not less than knowing the botanist's book, with all
        its definitions of classes, orders, and genera, by heart and with great proficiency. And which botanist can
        expect that? Which can justifiably demand it, when each person has roughly equal rights for their system and
        their definitions of genera?
        <br>
        If names are to be adopted into general usage, the assurance that they will remain unchanged is an essential
        condition. However, the boundaries of the collections of species, under the names of classes, orders, and
        genera, established by botanists are not immutable. Therefore, generic names, or those formed from the name of
        the genus and a suffix added to the species name, are quite inconvenient for general usage, because with every
        change in the boundaries of genera, some plants must change their position and migrate from one collection to
        another, thereby receiving new names.
        <br>
        One must also remember how little the use of language is within our control. For plants that have particularly
        attracted human attention, certain names have come into use, and still, as a plant becomes remarkable and gives
        occasion for discussion outside of botanists’ writings, it typically receives a name without botanists being
        consulted. It is undoubtedly wiser to yield to the power of language use than to oppose it, and any elegance one
        might wish to give the name, if it were in our control, pales in comparison to the inconveniences caused by
        changes in names for general use.
        <br>
        Fundamental botany is indeed the foundation of all other knowledge of plants, and indispensable, but it is only
        valuable insofar as it leads to more important insights, and the name of a plant is the first, but in itself the
        least, thing we need to know. Without a doubt, the multiplicity of names, where a single plant receives several
        names, or worse, where the same name applies to different plants by different botanists, is a true evil, and it
        is better to work toward a remedy for this than to deny it.
        <br>
        A botanical directory, in terms of the entire science of the plant kingdom, is roughly what a directory of fixed
        stars is in astronomy. If someone were to attempt to change the constellations and assign different names to the
        stars, would we tolerate that? In both sciences, everything depends on the completeness of the directories, on
        the correct identification of each listed plant or star, on the precise meaning of the names or signs assigned
        to them, and on the stability and retention of once-adopted names, but nothing depends on the nature of the
        names, insofar as they are words or sounds.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 141.</h3>
        To remedy the complaints that have always been directed against botany and botanists, it seems necessary that
        botanists observe the distinction between names for general use and botanical names.
        <br>
        1. Therefore, for general use outside of botany, certain customary names should be introduced, and these must be
        independent names—names that do not refer to or have any connection with any system, collections of species, or
        subspecies. They should be particular, not collective names, one for each distinct true species in nature. With
        such a customary name, any botanist can assign any species to their system as they please, group it with other
        species in a genus, or separate it again, without such changes having a detrimental general influence.
        <br>
        2. The choice and establishment of such customary names must be entrusted to the authors of the most
        comprehensive directories of the plant kingdom—people like Bauhin, Tournefort, Linnaeus in our time, and whoever
        in the future will undertake this deserving and monumental work on the entire plant kingdom—or to someone like
        Dillenius for a specific class of the plant kingdom. Other botanists will easily adopt such a nomenclature, as
        each can still remain within their own system and their concepts of the affinities of plants. From the founders
        of this nomenclature, one can expect and demand that they make good choices, especially preferring the
        established names over any reasons for change.
        <br>
        3. It is not immediately necessary to assign such customary names to all plants, but only to those that have
        attracted more general attention than merely from botanists—those that are discussed outside the writings of
        botanists, in the fields of medicine, agriculture, and other branches of economy. With respect to other plants,
        one can manage with the botanical names of this or that botanist as long as they are only concerned with
        botanists. If these plants also become notable, they may receive their customary names in due time. Since this
        usually happens on its own, without the intervention of botanists, it is wiser to wait until such names can be
        established in accordance with the already prevailing language use.
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 142.</h3>
        Botanical names can most conveniently be considered as technical terms, and here, again, the distinction must be
        made between technical terms that are universally accepted by all experts and technical terms that are unique to
        a specific person and express certain concepts particular to them. The former type includes the names of natural
        classes that have been recognized and universally accepted by botanists. As more such classes are defined, their
        corresponding names will be introduced without difficulty. The latter type refers to the names of genera that
        have been created by different botanists in different ways, where, as experience teaches and as the fluctuating
        boundaries of these genera make it inevitable, no agreement can be expected.
        <br>
        In the case of all technical terms, the rule must be observed that the concepts and things indicated by them
        must often occur in the science, and that terminology, while on one side guarding the decay of sciences by
        maintaining a specific language, can, if exaggerated, impede the spread of the sciences by the fearsome
        impression it gives them. It is often preferable to explain a rare occurrence with a paraphrase, rather than
        burdening memory with a term for a rare case. The concepts of entire natural classes are concepts that often
        appear, and the names for these classes are not numerous, but genera contain few species, and there are an
        incredibly large number of them.
        <br>
        Furthermore, one must consider the various intentions in naming plants. If someone's intention is to identify an
        unfamiliar plant precisely, the name does nothing for this, but the character of the plant is key, and it makes
        no difference whether one mentions the page of the book where it is found or the name of the plant, when in both
        cases, the book must be consulted. If the goal is simply to indicate the natural relationship of a plant, one
        can indicate the class with its general name and, within the class, one of the most well-known species that is
        the closest match. No direct reference to a book is necessary for this purpose.
        <br>
        When botanists discuss plants they wish to compare, again, the reference to each botanist’s book and its current
        status is necessary, and in this usage, names are merely tools to indicate the positions of the characters,
        perhaps more conveniently than through numbers or other signs, where typographical errors and confusion can more
        easily occur and are harder to detect.
        <br>
        In this context, and in all cases where there is a direct relationship to a botanist’s book, one can gladly
        accept all the names he wishes to give the plants, old or new, along with any daily changes, as long as he does
        not demand that these names also apply outside of the book.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3>§. 143.</h3>
        The names of plants in living national languages are even less within the control of botanists than those in the
        common dead language of Latin. In the case of such names, it is even more necessary that they be free from any
        relationship not only to a specific system but even to the science itself, because such a relationship is only
        understandable to the few people who are dedicated to the science. For the botanist, there is little more to do
        concerning these names than to collect them as he finds them, noting the province and region where each is
        commonly used, since often a plant may have a name in only one province, while it is either not found or
        nameless in others, or may have a distinct name in every province. He can give preference to one of these names
        and propose it for general use, or, for plants that have no names, he can suggest names that must be completely
        independent. But he must leave them to their fate and be content with the unforced influence over the national
        languages that any respected writer of his nation can always expect. It cannot be emphasized enough that names
        must become usual and must be independent. Therefore, literal translations of Latin names of plants, as adopted
        by one or another botanist, into the national language for the purpose of creating names for the local language,
        are especially objectionable.

        <h3>§. 144.</h3>
        The so-called specific names are very improperly called names, as they are brief descriptions and expressions of
        the character of the plants.
        <br>
        Also, the so-called synonyms, as mentioned in §139, or indications of how a plant is named by different writers,
        and where and how they report it, are actually not names, but citations, roughly analogous to citations from
        canon law in legal studies. The purpose of citing these synonyms is to compare the writers to one another, and
        it is assumed that one has these works at hand in order to consult them as needed. This is explicitly
        referenced, and it can be just as well done by indicating the page and place in a book, but citing with a few
        words is more secure than citing with mere numbers, and such a name from an author usually indicates, even
        without checking the book itself, to some extent, what kind of ideas the writer had about the plant.
