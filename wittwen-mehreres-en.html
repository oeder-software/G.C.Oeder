                My wish expressed in the aforementioned essay (pages 610, 611) has not been fulfilled, and likely never
                will be. That is very unfortunate! Had we possessed information on the 2070 persons admitted to the
                Copenhagen Military Widow’s Fund between the years 1739 and 1745 — or even just on the 1290 admitted in
                the years 1739 and 1740, of whom only very few, formerly married at the time, can now be surviving — had
                we known how old each was at that time, and how old each eventually became, it would have constituted
                the most complete dataset imaginable, not only for our own time, but for the coming generation as well.
                <br>
                <br>In the meantime, a few other sets of data have recently come into my possession, which may also
                serve the purpose of testing any proposed plan for a widow’s fund. Of these, I wish to present the one
                that appears to me the most notable, and to demonstrate how it may be utilized.
                <br>
                <br>It concerns 200 Hamburg clergymen, and is contained in the following schema, in which column I shows
                each clergyman’s age at the time of assuming office, column II the full age ultimately attained, and
                column III the additional years lived following entry into office.

                This dataset has, in comparison to the others communicated to me at the same time, the advantage that we
                have here 200 individuals who, at the point in time we imagine as the moment of entry into a relief
                institution, could reliably be presumed healthy — for whoever takes up an office can generally be
                considered to be in good health.
                <br>
                <br>Nothing prevents us from considering these 200 clergymen, who gradually became members of the
                Hamburg clergy, as contemporaneous individuals. They are still 200 people, not intentionally selected
                from the totality of mankind, but randomly drawn — just as they appear in vita communi, ordinary life —
                and the laws of nature act the same at any given time. Nothing prevents us from viewing the moment of
                assuming office as the terminus receptionis into a support institution. Nothing, finally, prevents us
                from placing one hundred of these persons in relation to the other hundred, in the same way as between
                man and wife in a widow’s fund, or more generally between provider and pensioner in a relief
                institution. The marital relationship is irrelevant; gender difference likewise means nothing — at
                least, we have up to now no classically accepted mortality tables differentiating by sex. It is
                sufficient that they are human beings: one hundred potential pensioners (P.), for whom one hundred
                providers (V.) purchase a pension, to be enjoyed by each P. for the remainder of his life, should he
                outlive his V. Now, if we let each P. reciprocally act as provider for his V., we then have 200 pairs of
                persons mutually securing to one another a pension to be enjoyed by the one who lives the longest — and
                each such double pair yields a defined pension recipient. The pairing and combination of these persons
                is possible in many ways and is in itself arbitrary, only the individuals to be paired must not be
                intentionally chosen: we thus combine the first hundred with the second hundred according to the natural
                sequence of numbers in the Hamburg-provided register — No. 1 with No. 101, No. 2 with No. 102, and so
                on. The eventual pensions are set uniformly at 10 Reichsthaler, paid in semiannual installments of 5
                Reichsthaler. The interest rate is fixed at 4 percent, payable semiannually — that is, 2 percent per
                half-year period. In order to calculate the balance between expenditures and revenues, we fix a common
                date of admission to the institution, and discount every item of expense and income falling before or
                after that moment par disconto to that same point in time — whence the total sum of expenditures and
                revenues arises from the aggregated discounts.
                <br>
                <br>For discounting at this rate of interest, the table provided in the first essay on page 620 is to be
                used, and it is employed as follows. From it one can determine how much a forthcoming periodic
                semiannual payment of 1 is worth in advance as a lump sum. For example, receiving 1 every half year, 30
                times in succession, is equivalent to receiving 22 3965/1000 in cash at once. The value of any other
                periodic payment can be found by multiplying it by the discount shown in the table. For instance, 250
                multiplied by 22.3965 yields 5599.125. That is: a pension of 250 Reichsthaler, received 30 times
                consecutively every half-year — or a pension of 500 Reichsthaler annually in semiannual installments
                over 15 years, a total of 7500 Reichsthaler — is numerically worth the same as a lump-sum advance of
                5599 1/8 Reichsthaler. In other words, with a cash sum of 5599 1/8 Reichsthaler properly employed,
                including interest and compound interest, the aforementioned pension can be covered over the given time.
                <br>
                <br>To facilitate calculations, when the payment to substitute for 1 is a number with multiple digits,
                logarithms are included in the table alongside the discounts. One need only add the logarithm of the
                desired payment to the appropriate logarithm from the table. If the discount for a periodic payment is
                to be found where the payments begin only after a certain deferment period, one takes the discount for
                the full period, subtracts the discount for the deferment, and the remainder is the discount for the
                deferred annuity. For example: if the payment of 250 Reichsthaler is to begin only after 15 years and
                continue for 10 years, one subtracts 5599.125 (the discount for 15 years) from 7855.925 (the discount
                for 25 years), and the difference — 2256.8 Reichsthaler — is the sought discount. Readers with
                mathematical understanding will pardon these explanations, which are required for those who possess no
                more than ordinary arithmetic skills. Yet it is not only advisable but necessary — and indeed not
                difficult — to render the calculations arising in a relief institution intelligible to all reasonable
                readers; and when stripped of all algebra, the theories take on a wholly simple appearance.
                <br>
                <br>We now proceed to the calculation of the expenditure, according to the following schema.

                In columns III and IV are recorded the number of years that the paired individuals continued to live
                after the terminus receptionis. In columns V and VI, these years have been converted into half-yearly
                periods, with column V always showing the lesser number, and column VI the greater. In column VII appear
                the discounts from the discount table corresponding to the number of semiannual terms in column V; in
                column VIII, the same discounts for the number of terms listed in column VI.
                <br>
                <br>The sum of the entries in column VII is 21,472,368. The sum of the entries in column VIII is
                34,258,513, of which the last four digits are decimal places if the semiannual payment is 1. If the
                payment is 10, then the last three digits are decimals. Now, since the semiannual payment is 5, we take
                half of these sums: 10,736,184 and 17,129,256. The difference between these two — 6393.072 — is the
                total expenditure for all the pensioners derived from the hundred double pairs, namely 6393
                Reichsthaler.
                <br>
                <br>This expenditure is now res facti — a matter of fact — and under the assumptions adopted, there can
                be no dispute that pensioners arising from 200 such pairs (whether married couples or same-sex pairs)
                would have cost so much. Nor does there appear to be any serious objection to the validity of the
                assumptions.
                <br>
                <br>Let each person now consider how, under his own plan, he would have fared with 200 such pairs, and
                how his proposed revenue would have balanced the expenditure. I shall now show how the income
                calculation can be taken up in the case of the three famous widow funds of northern Germany: the Bremen,
                the Calenberg, and the Royal Prussian.

                <h2>
                    The Bremen Widow’s Fund

                </h2>
                In this fund, for a contingent pension of 40 Reichsthaler, one pays 7½ Reichsthaler upon entry, and then
                the same amount each year thereafter. Thus, for a contingent pension of 10 Reichsthaler, the entry fee
                is 1.875 Rthlr. and the semiannual contribution is 0.9375 Rthlr. — all without the slightest
                consideration of the person’s age. Because of the entry fee, we first subtract 200 times 1.875 Rthlr.,
                or 375 Rthlr., from the total cost, leaving 6017? Rthlr. to be covered by the semiannual contributions.
                <br>
                <br>To simplify the calculation, one may group together the pairs whose co-existence period was the
                same. For example, pairs No. 1, 9, 81, and 94 had a shared duration of 28 years or 56 half-year periods.
                Therefore, we multiply 4 × 0.9375 = 3.75 by the value found in the discount table for 56 terms, which is
                33.505, and obtain 125.64 or 125 64/100 Rthlr. This is then doubled — that is, 251.28 Rthlr. — since
                these are double pairs. That is to say, the total contributions made by the double pairs 1, 9, 81, 94
                over the full time during which the paired individuals lived simultaneously are worth as much as if
                those 8 individuals had, at the outset, paid a lump sum of 251 28/100 Rthlr.
                <br>
                <br>Likewise, the pairs No. 2, 10, 33, 39, 97, and 98 had the same duration of 24 years or 48 periods.
                Therefore, we multiply 6 × 0.9375 = 5.625 by the table’s value at 48, which is 30.674, and get 172.54
                Rthlr. — or doubled, 345 8/100 Rthlr. — as the value of the contributions made by these 6 double pairs,
                and so on.

                    The Calenberg Widow’s Fund

                </h2>
                Its income consists of the interest earned from the entry payments, and the total value of the
                simplorum. The entry fee equals one year’s pension, provided the age difference between the paired
                individuals does not exceed 20 years; and the semiannual interest on 10 Reichsthaler is 0.2. As shown
                just before, one groups together pairs with the same duration. For example, pairs No. 1, 9, 81, 94:
                multiplying 4 × 0.2 = 0.8 by the value 33.505 from the discount table yields 26.804, which is then
                doubled to 53.608 Rthlr. as the interest return from the entry fees of these 4 double pairs. This usage
                of the entry fees accounts for roughly 13/100 of the total expenditure, so the remaining 87/100 must be
                covered by the return from the simplorum.
                <br>
                <br>This return is likewise calculated by discounting the amount of simpla owed by each pair (which must
                be paid periodically) back to the entry date. The total of these discounted amounts gives a sum of
                simplis, whose value — if paid up front — would be equal to the value of the simplorum to be paid
                gradually over time. The portion of the total cost not covered by interest is then distributed over this
                total simplis amount, thereby determining the value to be assigned to one simplum, which must be paid
                uniformly in each term to ensure a correct balance between expenditure and income.
                <br>
                <br>For example: the double pair No. 1 assumes 20 simpla in the case where the 43-year-old is the
                pensioner and the 33-year-old the contributor, and 55 simpla for the reverse case (P. 33, V. 43), for a
                total of 75 simpla. This quantity, payable in each half-year term, multiplied by the value 33.505 from
                the discount table for 56 periods, yields 2512.875 — i.e., 2512 or 2513 simpla paid at once upon entry
                is equivalent in value to a numerical total of 4200 simpla spread over 56 half-year periods, assuming a
                constant price per simplum, etc.

                    The Royal Prussian Widow's Fund

                </h2>
                This fund likewise has a dual source of income: interest on entry fees, and annual contributions.
                However, since the entry fees depend on the age of the contributor, it is best to combine the interest
                with the contributions and discount the total sum together.
                <br>
                <br>For example, in double pair No. 1:If P. is 43 and V. is 53, the entry fee is 23 Rthlr., with an
                annual contribution of 6 Groschen;If P. is 33 and V. is 43, the entry fee is 33 Rthlr., with an annual
                contribution of 3 Rthlr.The combined entry fees total 56 Rthlr., with a semiannual interest of 1.12
                Rthlr.Combined annual contributions amount to 3 Rthlr. 6 Gr., or 1 Rthlr. 15 Gr. semiannually = 1.625
                Rthlr.
                <br>
                <br>The combined yield is 1.12 + 1.625 = 2.745.Multiplied by 33.505 (from the discount table at 56
                periods), this gives 91.971 Rthlr. — the total discounted value of income from this double pair, both
                from interest and contributions during their co-existence. This corresponds to a contingent pension of
                25 Rthlr., or 36.788 Rthlr. for a 10 Rthlr. pension.

                <br>For double pair No. 2:If P. is 30 and V. 37, the entry fee is 27 Rthlr. and the contribution 1
                Rthlr. 22 Gr.;If P. is 37 and V. 30, the entry fee is 20 Rthlr. and the contribution 12 Gr.The
                semiannual interest on 47 Rthlr. is 0.94; half of the combined contribution of 2 Rthlr. 10 Gr. is
                1.2083.Total income is 0.94 + 1.2083 = 2.1483.Multiplied by 30.674 (from the table at 48 periods), this
                yields 65.902 Rthlr. for a 25 Rthlr. pension, or 26.361 Rthlr. for a 10 Rthlr. pension, and so on.

                <br>A detailed presentation of these calculations concerning the structured revenue of the three widow’s
                funds cannot be included here for lack of space. I also refrain from presenting the final results
                because I wish that those who are invested in the matter — especially those entrusted with the
                administration of these institutions — may themselves assess the outcome. My aim is not to contest these
                institutions but merely to provide a test (a common instrument), by which any such establishment may be
                examined, and the communication of such a test deserves, surely, not reproach but thanks — whatever the
                result may be.
                <br>
                <br>That I am concerned with nothing but truth and certainty in such an important matter of public
                welfare is evidenced by the following candid confession of the effect that the application of the test I
                have now set forth has had on myself. In the first essay (p. 614), I mentioned a plan for a widow’s fund
                which I had personally developed, along with a theory by which the tables of the general provision
                institution in Hamburg — established according to my proposals — had been calculated. These tables I
                have now withdrawn and replaced with others, calculated according to the method shown by Price and other
                writers, which I call the summation method. I give it this name because it consists of discounting back,
                for each age level in Süßmilch’s (or any other chosen) mortality (properly, decrement) table, the number
                of surviving persons, and summing these discounts. What formerly held me back from adopting this method
                — apart from some doubts about its internal structure — was chiefly its costliness: under this method,
                joining such an institution on a contributory basis proved unexpectedly and undesirably expensive. As
                soon as I obtained the experiences here shared, and others long sought, I made impartial use of them —
                as the directors of the general provision institution in Hamburg will attest — and even before any
                external criticism was voiced, I voluntarily informed them that our tables, though already regarded by
                many as too costly, were still not sufficient to ensure the institution’s stable foundation.
                <br>
                <br>Whether my confession will find followers in Bremen, in Hanover, or in Berlin remains to be seen; I
                will only state that if one (setting aside the effect of differing interest rates) cannot achieve
                sufficiency or balance with the tables we used in Hamburg, then it is all the less possible under the
                terms and tables of the three often-mentioned esteemed institutions.
                <br>
                <br>Indeed, it seems that experiences such as those presented in this essay, and the detailed
                calculations based on them — as here exemplified — are necessary to make room for the otherwise costly
                summation method. And I may rightly say that, had such calculations been published earlier, there would
                have been less controversy over widow’s funds and more conviction achieved. One can argue much over
                theory — but facts compel acknowledgment.
                <br>
                <br>People often refer to the supposed ratio of standing marriages to widows in vita communi; yet this
                is a highly misleading foundation for establishing or evaluating an institution. It is generally
                difficult to obtain comparable figures accurately and completely from a sufficiently large district, a
                state, or a province. The age at marriage — whether early or late — varies both for the general
                population and for the segment inclined to join a widow’s fund. There is also a significant difference
                between widows who remarry and thereby forfeit a pension, and those who have no pension to lose. Hence,
                from all this data on standing marriages and widows, nothing definite can be concluded about the period
                of disbursement or the preceding period of rest.
                <br>
                <br>In a word: for a clear and decisive comparison between what truly occurs among people and what every
                widow’s fund plan presupposes, only examples of couples who have actually lived — and are now deceased
                so that their entire lifespan is known — will suffice; examples drawn randomly from the total
                population, not selected with intent; examples in sufficient number so that gains and losses may offset
                one another. If, in such cases, actual expenditures align with planned revenues, the plan may be deemed
                sound — for it would be an incomprehensible coincidence if such agreement arose merely by chance. And if
                expenditures and revenues do not align, how can one reasonably expect them to do so in a hundred or a
                thousand other cases?
                Let all this be carefully considered and taken to heart — this is a matter of great importance.
