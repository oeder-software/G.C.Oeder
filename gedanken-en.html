                    <h3>1.
                    </h3> Paper money consists of instruments of obligation, made out to the unnamed bearer, so that, in
                    their passing from hand to hand, no formal act of transfer is required.

                    <h3>2. </h3>
                    They are, like all instruments of obligation, signs of a certain quantity or portion of gold or
                    silver, which the bearer is to receive at a fixed time — here, at any time he demands it — from the
                    issuer of the instrument of obligation.

                    <h3>3. </h3>
                    The value of the sign rests upon the certainty of the promise being fulfilled.

                    <h3>4. </h3>
                    The judgment of this certainty rests upon the consideration of those circumstances which arise among
                    men in their dealings, at the issuing or origin, and in the circulation of these instruments of
                    obligation (which, owing to their compendious form, are commonly called notes), and these are
                    accordingly to be sought out and examined.

                    <h3>5. </h3>
                    The metals—the noble ones, gold and silver, and the less noble, copper—are in truth themselves but
                    signs of the goods that are exchangeable among men in commerce; yet these metals are, throughout the
                    whole civilized world—as it consists of nations and states, distinguished by customs, beliefs, laws,
                    and languages—acknowledged as the standard and equivalent of all goods; and by the inimitability of
                    their substance, they are secured against undetectable counterfeits. They, the metals, thus truly
                    stand in relation to paper money as the thing itself to its sign, and therefore, in this regard
                    also, deserve the name of the thing, and possess intrinsic value.

                    <h3>6. </h3>
                    By contrast, the value of paper money—in which the substance is nothing and the form is
                    everything—rests solely upon opinion, and cannot be upheld by command in any lawful manner; rather,
                    every attempt at coercion, whose reach in any case extends but little, wholly undermines that
                    opinion.

                    <h3>7. </h3>
                    Among the circumstances occurring at the origin of paper money, and in the issuance of the
                    corresponding notes, the issuer or issuers thereof are above all to be considered; for they must
                    designate a place where the sign may be offered in exchange for the thing — that is, where the paper
                    money may be redeemed for metallic money — and where the actual realization takes place. This place
                    is called the bank, as is any place where money is laid down for common use and commerce; and under
                    this designation, the issuer or issuers themselves, along with their entire dealings in paper money,
                    are often understood. The bank, then, is either the bank of the state — whereby the state, as
                    issuer, is liable for the redemption of the notes — or it is a private bank, established by a union
                    of private persons, who then bear the responsibility for the redemption.

                    <h3>8. </h3>
                    It is understood that such a private bank cannot arise at all without the approval of the
                    government; and must further be placed under strict supervision—more necessary here even than in the
                    coining of metallic money, which all governments reserve to themselves as a sovereign right. The
                    misfortune attendant upon the insolvency and failure of a note-issuing bank is so great and
                    widespread; the condition of the holders of this kind of instruments of obligation is, in comparison
                    with that of holders of other properly defined instruments of obligation commonly encountered in
                    civil life and before courts, so disadvantageous to such holders; and the confusion arising from
                    equal claims upon an insufficient fund, and from the unraveling of a pot in which so much has been
                    mingled together, is so immense and inextricable, that it may well be asserted: by merely permitting
                    so dubious and hazardous a trade, a government takes upon itself the obligation of guaranteeing
                    against the consequences thereof.

                    <h3>9. </h3>
                    The question, which kind of note-issuing bank — the state bank or the private bank — deserves or may
                    expect greater credit, is difficult to answer in itself, and nearly superfluous, when, as is and
                    ever shall be mostly the case, the private bank stands in nexus with the state, and has become
                    embarrassed through advances it has made to him. The concern for the holder of the note, that the
                    state bank cannot be compelled like a private person, is then the same; such a bank, having the
                    state as debtor and support, is hardly to be forced at all.

                    <h3>10.</h3>
                    Another circumstance worthy of serious consideration is the genuineness of the notes. Without doubt,
                    all that is fashioned by the hand of man may likewise be imitated by it; the examples of Hammond in
                    Denmark and of Charles Price in England have shown that false notes can be so closely made in
                    likeness that they may pass undetected even through the hands of bank clerks. For the skilled
                    deceiver, the craft of forging banknotes — wherein the substance is nothing, and the form everything
                    — is easier than with coinage, whose material is the work of nature; and likewise, the temptation to
                    deceit, and the advantage gained thereby — in that a note of high numerical value is no harder to
                    fabricate than one of little — is far greater than in the counterfeiting of coin. If, then, the
                    detection of false notes be left to chance, which the prudent and especially the comfort-seeking
                    fraudster may easily elude, no bank is secure from the existence — who knows in what quantity — of
                    false notes circulating before its very eyes; and so long as banks console themselves with a fancied
                    inimitability of their notes, the clever and cautious fraudster holds the winning hand. This, the
                    states which permit paper money, would do well to take somewhat more to heart.

                    <h3>11.</h3>
                    For the completely satisfactory reliability of the value of the notes, it is required that for every
                    note the thing it signifies — the substance — shall truly, in nature and not merely in idea, have
                    been present at the time of its issuance, and that, if demanded, it may immediately take the place
                    of the sign; consequently also, that after the issuance, the thing and its sign do not at the same
                    time enter into circulation. But such is found in none of the states that employ paper money; nor
                    indeed can it be found, for the very nature, the whole essence and being of the note-issuing banks,
                    rests upon the simultaneous circulation of the notes and the corresponding value they represent, and
                    without this no reason could be conceived for the issuers of the notes to establish such a bank.

                    <h3>12.</h3>
                    The nature of the modern note-issuing banks consists, by general admission, in this: that a fund of
                    hard coin is deposited, yet in exchange therefor a quantity of instruments of obligation is issued
                    and put into circulation, several times exceeding the value of said fund. The excess of the
                    note-quantity over the fund is a wealth brought forth in idea, the benefit lying in its use; and the
                    instruments of obligation belonging to such excess have, from their very origin, no real value
                    corresponding to them, but only an ideal one.

                    <h3>13.</h3>
                    The English Bank, from which—being the elder in existence—the aforementioned newer banks have
                    learned the use of paper money, is said, so far as is known, to issue no instrument of obligation
                    except against received value, and in this regard differs from the so-called newer note-issuing
                    banks in respect to the circumstances attending the origin of the notes. Yet this causes no
                    essential difference in the end, since on the one hand the English Bank puts into circulation the
                    money or value received for the issued note, and on the other hand the holder of the note puts into
                    circulation the paper he has received in return for value given, so that thing and sign always enter
                    circulation together.

                    <h3>14.</h3>
                    It is required, I say, and I repeat it—since this is the principal axiom from which all reflections
                    upon paper money must proceed—that, for the value of paper money to possess fully satisfying
                    reliability, the thing itself must, whenever it is demanded, be able immediately to take the place
                    of the sign. If we assume with Mr. Wendeborn, Vol. I, p. 11, that the sum of all ready money in
                    Great Britain and Ireland amounts to about 24 million pounds sterling—according to Mr. Archenholz,
                    Vol. III, p. 349, only 20 million—yet at least 50 million pounds sterling in instruments of
                    obligation (Bank notes) from the Bank of England are in circulation: it is indeed remarkable that
                    the event, which has certainly already been near and was only averted by paltry expedients—namely,
                    that more signs would have poured in at once than the available cash reserve could reasonably
                    support—has not occurred more frequently; and it is to be feared that it will one day arise without
                    remedy. And states which do not possess the resources England has, might well consider carefully
                    before following England’s example.

                    <h3>15.</h3>
                    Little indeed harms little, and the substitution of the sign for the thing is permissible to a
                    certain extent, yea, even with some apparent advantage; but the allure of this seeming advantage is
                    so seductive that, as experience shows, one must much too often fear abuse. We have the warning
                    example of a giro bank which, through the enticing thought that it were a pity to let the amassed
                    money lie idle whilst it was transferred between accounts, was nearly brought to ruin, had not
                    sensible men put a stop to it in time; how much less is it to be wondered at, that governments, in
                    the manifold embarrassments in which they often fall, whether through their own fault or not, resort
                    to this expedient?

                    <h3>16.</h3>
                    Especially the costliness of the art of war in modern times is a cause of the ever-increasing use of
                    paper money. The manner of conducting war in these latter days requires an expense which cannot,
                    amid the already highly levied burdens in most countries during times of peace, be raised so swiftly
                    as the urgent necessities of the times demand. From this have arisen two opposing financial systems,
                    the Loan System and the Savings System, which may well be called the English and the Prussian,
                    respectively. According to the Loan System, England gathers money in large sums by loan from its
                    wealthy subjects and inhabitants, and imposes taxes for the payment of interest and gradual
                    repayment thereafter. According to the Savings System, taxes are arranged already in times of peace
                    so that a portion is set aside for future use. Both systems have their inconveniences, which I shall
                    not here elaborate; but it is incontestable that the Savings System accords more with the old maxim,
                    tempore pacis de bello cogitandum, than the Loan System; and it suffices to say that Great Britain,
                    with its Loan System, has increased its national debt, which according to Wendeborn, vol. 1, p. 127,
                    at the beginning of this century amounted to about sixteen million pounds sterling, to two hundred
                    and fifty million by 1783, ibid. 126 (even higher according to Price on Reversionary Payments, vol.
                    1, p. 234). In those states following the Loan System outside England, where there are fewer wealthy
                    lenders, the state or government itself produces paper money; in England it is done by the Bank,
                    which by this substitution puts the ready cash of wealthy persons into its hands, and thereby aids,
                    partly with a portion of the paper money, the government.

                    <h3>17.</h3>
                    Without engaging in a detailed exposition of the, at last sufficiently acknowledged, inconveniences
                    of the paper money accumulated in circulation, I shall merely set forth some considerations which
                    particularly pave the way for measures to remedy the evil. Here is the consideration: Only that is
                    money which is universally acknowledged as such; and only that paper money is valid money which can
                    at any moment be realized at full value. If it cannot, and is nevertheless maintained in circulation
                    by compulsion, it will inevitably drive out the coined money; for who does not prefer the thing to
                    the symbol? And how can one — I will not even speak of by what right — how can one effectively
                    prevent this?

                    <h3>18.</h3>
                    Second Consideration. It is assumed, as aforementioned, that in England fifty million paper money
                    circulate against and alongside twenty-four million coined money, more than twice the amount of the
                    former to the latter; in other states, where paper money is not issued against received currency as
                    in England, but rather created and put into circulation at discretion without corresponding real
                    currency, there is without doubt several times more paper money than metal money. It is evident that
                    little will be accomplished by gradually removing only a moderate portion of the paper mass; rather,
                    the matter must be earnestly addressed in its entirety to remove the harmful competition between
                    metal money and paper money.

                    <h3>19.</h3>
                    Third Consideration. Paper money consists in instruments of obligation, and is a debt which must be
                    paid, and which I shall hereafter always regard as the debt of the State; for wherever paper money
                    and its excess exist, the State is accountable therefor: but it cannot be balanced with coined
                    money, of which, as said, there is not so much anywhere in the world; nor is it necessary — only the
                    name must be changed, and these instruments of obligation, payable to the bearer and demanding
                    payment on demand, may be exchanged for instruments of obligation naming a certain owner, such
                    naming never excluding cession to another named owner, and prescribing a stipulated time for
                    payment; the contracted debt must be divested of the nature of money, and thus removed from
                    circulation, whereby the debt will be resolved in due time. Other States, of which I think in this
                    assertion, are not yet burdened with debt.

                    <h3>20.</h3>
                    Fourth Consideration. The debt must and shall be capable of being managed without the ruin and
                    manifold evils of a bankruptcy, if the government of such a State is honest, orderly, and steadfast.
                    For, as I may be permitted here to repeat from my first essay in the 43rd volume, p. 384,
                    "a State, inhabited by cultivated, enlightened, skilled, and active people, under good weather, good
                    soil, and the mildness of Nature in bestowing her gifts, has an immeasurable value, against which
                    any State debt, however great, stands in no assignable proportion."
                    It is true, it causes dread to read from Mr. Price and Mr. Wendeborn that the burdens of the English
                    National Debt absorb more than half of the yearly great revenues; but if the effect of the sinking
                    fund were not continually overwhelmed by new debts brought on by the course of time, this burden
                    would be like the basket of victuals which Xesopus chose to carry among his fellow slaves; and to
                    the extent that England and France — yet the other States, which I have in mind in this essay, are
                    not yet overburdened with debt.

                    <h3>21.</h3>
                    Fifth Consideration. To satisfy the aforementioned obligations in justice, such a government must
                    arrange its household so as to secure a certain surplus of income over expenditure, which may serve
                    as the foundation for a sinking fund.
                    <h3>22.</h3>
                    Sixth Consideration. A government that has secured such a sinking fund can then rely on its own
                    strength, and needs no expedients which, in the absence of such a fund, would be of no avail; it
                    requires no recourse to banker’s credit or bank credit. Montesquieu says in Esprit des Loix (Works
                    II, p. 29): les Banquiers sont faits pour changer de l'argent et non pas pour en prêter. I would not
                    take this so literally; for why should a government borrowing money not accept it from bankers, who
                    have their own or entrusted funds to invest? But I mean only to say, and so I believe Montesquieu
                    also meant, that a government ought to be able to rely on its own credit, and need not be compelled
                    to seek refuge in banker’s credit; just as I believe a government competent in justice and proper
                    administration will not find itself compelled to such refuge.

                    <h3>23.</h3>
                    As to the recourse to bank credit, I hold, and this is the seventh consideration, that it is best
                    for the State on the one hand, and for the subjects and merchants, whether individually or combined
                    in companies, on the other, that the monetary transactions of the State and Government, and the
                    monetary transactions of the merchants, remain distinct. If the government has payments to make
                    abroad, it requires bankers and instructs them accordingly; these then undertake the payment: there
                    the matter ends, and the transaction has no further influence. Likewise, when merchants make mutual
                    export and import agreements with merchants of other states, after deducting some of the minor daily
                    circumstances which always have only a small influence on the exchange rate, the rate can only
                    increase notably to the advantage or disadvantage of one party or the other insofar as one becomes
                    debtor to the other for more goods received to a noticeable degree. But by mixing the State’s
                    monetary dealings with the merchants’ settlements, the exchange rate of a country can certainly
                    become less favorable and remain so longer than it otherwise would or could by trade alone.

                    <h3>24.</h3>
                    From these considerations arise the measures increasing in necessity and to be proposed for the
                    redemption of paper money. Before these are presented, one must also consider whether the paper
                    money was issued by the government of the state itself and under its own name, or whether it was
                    issued by a bank, which has made loans to the state from it. In this case, the portion of the paper
                    mass that has benefited the government and for which it is liable must be distinguished from that
                    portion of the mass for which the bank itself is liable. Properly speaking, the bank is primarily
                    liable to the public for the entire mass; and the government representing the state's share delivers
                    to the bank the redeemed notes up to the full amount of the state's share.

                    <h3>25.</h3>
                    The bank collects its own share of the paper mass as assets from its debtors; and this cannot be
                    difficult for it, provided it has conducted its business properly and cautiously: namely insofar as
                    <br>
                    <br>a) nothing has been lent without pledge and written security;
                    <br>
                    <br>b) insofar as the pledges retain their value, and the securities are collectible;
                    <br>
                    <br>c) insofar as the stakeholders have never paid out more than actual profit as dividends;
                    <br>
                    <br>d) insofar as no counterfeit notes exist;
                    <br>
                    <br>e) insofar as accurate accounting, as evidenced from the books, has always been maintained.
                    <br>
                    <br>Whatever has been neglected in points a-e is the liability of the bank.

                    <h3>26.</h3>
                    Due to circumstance d), namely the very probable existence of counterfeit notes and their detection,
                    the redeemed notes must not be destroyed immediately, but sorted according to their numbers and kept
                    in bundles until further notice.

                    <h3>27.</h3>
                    The collection of notes lent by the bank to private persons can, as said, cause no great
                    difficulties, insofar as these debtors possess assets from which they, like any debtor, can and must
                    take what is owed; but the collection and redemption of the notes which the bank has lent to the
                    State, that is what costs trouble, hoc opus, hic labor est! This part is by far the greater of the
                    note mass; to balance this mass with coin, and by means of cash redemption immediately remove it
                    from circulation, is impossible, as it exceeds the power of a government: nevertheless, the removal
                    of the paper money from circulation, at least in large measure, if not all at once, is necessary,
                    because coin alongside paper money that is not honored at full value cannot exist, but is lost
                    irretrievably, and because it cannot be coined earlier, as that would be of no use.

                    <h3>28.</h3>
                    The difficulty of shifting the burden of an excessively grown mass of paper money is great; yet it
                    can be lifted easily and without difficulty by a government which, through serious measures,
                    particularly by a well-founded redemption fund, acquires confidence, and by wealthy patriots in the
                    public who do not deny such a government the deserved trust, and assist it with loans: for
                    otherwise, except by means of loans founded upon a well and firmly established redemption fund, it
                    is according to the nature of things not possible to effect such a removal of a burden that requires
                    an immediate remedial measure.
                    <h3>29.</h3>
                    The next step, after establishing a basis for a redemption fund for the government of a state
                    burdened with paper money, would therefore be the opening of a loan, chiefly for natives but without
                    excluding foreigners, in paper money at a certain price, or in metal, coined or uncoined, according
                    to a fixed coin standard, at the creditor’s choice between paper or metal, depending on which he
                    finds more suitable to his condition. The provision for loans received in metal must also be to
                    exchange paper money for it.

                    <h3>30.</h3>
                    If the opening of the loan has the expected success from confidence, resulting in commitments of
                    sums whose total equals the portion of the paper money for which the state is liable, then the next,
                    that is the third step for the government, is the exclusion of paper money from the state’s coffers,
                    so that after a set time it issues no paper money in payment of its expenses. However, it continues
                    to accept paper money as a loan, as long as any is offered and can be offered.

                    <h3>31.</h3>
                    Together with the announcement of this exclusion of paper money from the coffers, in the order of
                    thoughts, but in execution actually somewhat earlier, provision must be made for new coinage; and
                    this new coinage would then be the fourth step of the government. It matters not under which coin
                    standard it is minted, provided the chosen standard is strictly observed: naturally, however, it is
                    advisable to remain with the once adopted customary national coin standard.

                    <h3>32.</h3>

                    <br>I have not wished to interrupt the sequence of thoughts in these three paragraphs with inserted
                    explanations, but will now provide these explanations.
                    <br>
                    <br>The paper money, as far as the state is liable for it, shall be honestly paid as state debt, but
                    can only be paid gradually, and must thus change its nature, and be transformed from a debt, the
                    payment of which can be demanded on sight of the certificate, into a debt whose payment in the
                    certificate is prescribed for a certain time and manner. This happens by means of the loan, and
                    thereby the paper money comes out of circulation as money.
                    <br>
                    <br>The loan becomes possible through the amortization fund established for the repayment of the
                    borrowed sums, and through the confidence of the lenders in such a fund.
                    <br>
                    <br>When through the loan the by far largest part of the note mass burdening the state is frozen and
                    withdrawn from circulation: then, and not before, can the government dare to command the remaining
                    small and insignificant part of the notes to be entirely removed from circulation, which is done by
                    excluding them from the state coffers.
                    <br>
                    <br>However, these somewhat delayed notes cannot be redeemed nor declared invalid; rather, the state
                    still accepts them as loans, in exchange for certificates prescribing a certain payment term:
                    possibly a terminus peremptorius may be set, after which notes delayed following such warning shall
                    become invalid everywhere: and with the establishment of such a terminus peremptorius, one may
                    rightly take the time of the notes’ issuance as a basis, so that after such a date no note issued in
                    the first five years since the introduction of the notes shall be valid any longer, after another
                    date no note from the following five years, and so forth.
                    <br>
                    <br>Only when the notes are out of circulation can the government, cum effectu, and with the hope
                    that coinage will remain in circulation, proceed to coin money; not before, otherwise the coinage
                    would be irretrievably lost alongside paper money, which is not accorded the full value it should
                    have by the letter of the law.
                    <br>
                    <br>And now it also becomes necessary to coin money, because in a state overloaded with paper money,
                    per rerum naturam, and precisely due to this overload, there is much paper but little coin, so that
                    after the removal of paper there would be a lack of money altogether as a medium of exchange. Since
                    minting requires some time, it must precede the exclusion of paper from the state coffers, so that
                    at the announcement of this exclusion a supply of coined money is immediately available.
                    <br>
                    <br>The act of coining itself, that is, the manufacture of precious metals, can cause no difficulty
                    for the government, costing essentially nothing but willingness, and compensates the expense by the
                    seigniorage. For we assume that the government has made other arrangements and provisions for its
                    debts, so that these have no influence on the new money coming directly from the mint. This new
                    money is thus either intended for the government’s current expenditures, which it then offsets with
                    current revenues; or it is provided and ordered by wealthy individuals and merchants who immediately
                    supply the necessary currency.

                    <h3>33.</h3>
                    The coin standard (Münzfuß) matters not at all, provided it is observed correctly in every detail.
                    In itself and originally, it is entirely indifferent which coin standard a state chooses; just as it
                    is indifferent which accounting unit is adopted. However, when an accounting unit, a coin standard,
                    has been chosen, introduced, and become customary in the land, it is advisable to adhere to it,
                    since deviation from what has once become customary leads to confusion. It is also advisable to
                    strike large pieces of the coarse coin, according to convenient divisions of the accounting unit —
                    thirds or marks, two-thirds, whole thalers, four-thirds or four-mark pieces, even two-thaler pieces
                    — but of the small change only as much as absolutely necessary, giving them a somewhat ample volume
                    and a good stamping, but not too little intrinsic content.
                    <br>
                    <br>Species and courant, as relative terms and expressions for things between which no fixed ratio
                    exists, truly do not belong in common life, however much they may be misused there; rather, they
                    belong at home in banks and commercial offices. Species-thalers, in a giro bank which counts by
                    thalers, are those coins which are considered and accepted as effective (I might soon say
                    personified) accounting units; whereas all other coins, without regard to their stamping, resemble
                    uncoined metal and have a variable value in banco (in bank transactions), which circumstances
                    determine daily. Even the coin of the place and state where the giro bank exists — the local courant
                    coin — is subject to this condition.

                    <h3>34.</h3>
                    Among the various kinds of loans, the following three are the principal and most common.
                    <br>
                    <br>I) The usual loan on capital, whereby the borrowed sum is repaid after the lapse of the
                    stipulated time, in the same measure as it was borrowed (here in the specified coin), and meanwhile
                    the stipulated interest is paid thereon.
                    <br>
                    <br>II) Loans with annual amortization, whereby the borrowed sum is partially replaced by periodic
                    payments of a stipulated amount in each of the stipulated periods, and terminates with the last of
                    these payments.
                    <br>
                    <br>III) Loan on life annuities, on one or two persons, whereby such a person, or two persons joined
                    together, receive an annual sum in replacement of the borrowed sum — the individual so long as he
                    lives, or the two joined persons so long as they live together, both together, and after the death
                    of one, the survivor so long as he still lives, and with the death of the persons the whole loan
                    expires. In this kind of loan, the government must be careful not to conclude life annuity contracts
                    otherwise than according to the age of the persons. The most convenient and advantageous for a
                    government is the loan with annual amortization, as it scarcely admits any fixed regulations,
                    affords the enjoyment of interest, and at the end of the stipulated time effects a complete
                    discharge of the debt.

                    <h3>35.</h3>
                    In determining the value at which the paper money shall be accepted for loans, the government
                    naturally bases itself on the current market rate. The holder and lender cannot reasonably complain
                    that the government does not accept these notes at their full literal currency at once, since such
                    currency is nowhere to be had, and he, the lender, cannot obtain such currency anywhere, and no
                    doubt he himself has accepted them as such literal currency. It is also all the less to be blamed on
                    the government that it seeks, as much as possible, to procure and redeem these depreciated notes
                    below their nominal price, since it may be assumed that much paper created for the service of the
                    government in times of distress was issued immediately below its literal value as soon as it came
                    into circulation. But here, in determining the price at which the notes should be accepted for
                    loans, the government has a means to favour those lenders who agree to the terms most advantageous
                    to the government; that is, the longest time for repayment, the largest loan amount: so it accepts
                    the notes at a higher rate from one who lets his capital stand for 20 years than from one who wants
                    it back after 10 years; higher from one who lends 20,000 than from one who advances only 10,000;
                    higher from one who buys an annual amortization over 30 years than from one who takes one over 20
                    years, and so forth.

                    <h3>36.</h3>
                    <br>Throughout this entire essay, I have directed my attention to countries where, indeed, a
                    part—perhaps the larger part—of the circulating paper money runs on account of the state and its
                    government, and constitutes a portion of the state’s debt: yet not by command or compulsion, but
                    because it has been gradually put into circulation through expenditures, always with the freely
                    given goodwill of the recipients. Yet now, in this latest time, the world witnesses the phenomenon
                    of a state—truly for the second time in a century of the same state—that wishes to forcibly give an
                    excessive part, the greater half of its state debt, the form of paper money, to issue certificates
                    of debt over this obligation, for whose realization no certain time is set, but which all are
                    payable at sight, thus all equally close to realization—a state where the paper money does not yet
                    exist, the public is not accustomed to its use and circulation, but where this money is suddenly
                    introduced, and indeed imposed upon the recipients.
                    <br>
                    <br>The state debts of this state already constitute such an enormous mass that the possibility of
                    repayment is hardly conceivable at all; a repayment which necessarily must take place gradually,
                    thus also necessarily in a properly arranged manner, so that each part of the debt mass reaches
                    realization and payment according to time and hour. However, this state also has large, difficult to
                    oversee and calculate auxiliary means; and generally applies to this state especially what I said
                    above in §20, and wish to repeat here.
                    <br>
                    <br>But regarding the circulation of a quantity of certificates amounting to a total perhaps equal
                    to all the gold and silver existing in the world, and all equally near to realization, therefore
                    also all equally distant from realization—I have no conception of such circulation; and the thought
                    of the confusion to be expected from it is dreadful to my imagination.
                    <br>
                    <br>For example, I do not understand how metal coinage can be maintained alongside such an excessive
                    quantity of paper money; I do not understand how, even if a state could do without metal coinage for
                    domestic commerce, it could conduct foreign trade without metal coinage, or maintain its political
                    relations with the entire world without metal coinage: for it remains true, or at least I cannot
                    free myself from this old-fashioned belief, that only that which is recognized throughout the wide
                    world is true money, only true money is the nervus rerum gerendarum (the nerve of business affairs);
                    not to mention several other concerns, except that it seems no thought is given to the very possible
                    and very troubling mixing of counterfeit paper among the immeasurable quantity of certificates
                    (assignats), nor to the warning principle that what human hands make can also be counterfeited by
                    human hands.*
                    <br>
                    <br>At present, it is altogether impossible for me to place confidence in the workings of an
                    assembly of men (even if they be the wisest of the nation) which has not yet succeeded in
                    establishing an executive power that stands above contradiction and resistance, without which their
                    decisions—let alone the fact that these reforms are all akin to a new creation, that they follow one
                    another too swiftly, that they delve too soon into detail, instead of the current beginning of the
                    new state of affairs requiring simple but fruitful fundamental laws from which, in due course, with
                    more leisure for mature reflection, the details should arise—are essentially nothing more than
                    theories.+
                    <br>
                    <br>To place confidence in the workings of an assembly whose existence is precarious, as no fixed
                    duration of its meeting is legally determined, and which, after the possible dissolution of this
                    first assembly today or tomorrow, is followed by the formation of a second, and furthermore, the
                    decisions of this second new assembly are exposed to many difficulties, seems to me unwarranted.

                        <br>+Thus, only theories; or political experiments, as I ventured to call them above (Issue 56,
                        p. 504); or rather, as the author of Journal politique national (Vol. II, p. 129) calls it, "une
                        épreuve faite sur 24 millions d’hommes, ficut in anima vili" (a trial made on 24 million men, as
                        if on a worthless soul)! No "work standing before our eyes, which bore witness to its master,"
                        as was said in the Teutschen Merkur! It is comforting to me that I can set against the authority
                        of Mr. Court Counselor Wieland, in matters requiring knowledge of state affairs, the authority
                        of Mr. Chapter Bailiff von Oeder. — Just as I can protect myself, in a matter requiring
                        historical knowledge (Mr. W.’s judgment about the respectable villain Cromwell, as liberator of
                        the Britons from the divine right of kings), with Henault’s authority:“Les Anglois cherchoient
                        la liberté par la mort de Charles I, & ils ne retrouverent qu’un tyran dans Cromwell; on
                        pourroit leur appliquer ce qui fut dit lors de la mort de César: sa mort ne fut qu’un crime,
                        puisqu’elle ne rétablit pas la liberté”(The English sought liberty by the death of Charles I,
                        and found only a tyrant in Cromwell; one might apply to them what was said at Caesar’s death:
                        his death was but a crime, since it did not restore liberty.)(Excerpt from Abrégé chronologique,
                        p. 1649).
